AB Glyphosate is a commonly used herbicide known for its high performance in killing certain plants and grasses; however, its use is regulated due to its harmful effects on the aquatic environment. The present study investigated and compared the toxic mechanisms of glyphosate on Microcystis aeruginosa (a toxin-producing cyanobacterium) under 2 conditions: 0 parts per thousand saline media (experiment I) and 2.5 parts per thousand saline media (experiment II). The results indicated that an appropriate concentration of glyphosate provided a phosphate source for M. aeruginosa, resulting in an increased specific growth rate in both experimental groups compared with the controls. Glyphosate-enhanced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity increased by up to 1.37-fold in experiment I and 1.68-fold in experiment II. Moreover, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) decreased at glyphosate concentrations below 1.2 mg L-1 but increased at concentrations greater than 1.2 mg L-1 in experiment I, whereas SOD and CAT activities decreased in experiment II and declined by 64 and 49% in the 30 mg L-1 treatments. Furthermore, the transcript abundances of the pyruvate carboxylase (pcB), microcystin synthetase B (mcyB), and paired-like homeobox (phoX) genes were up-regulated by up to 6.92-, 3.63-, and 2.27-fold in experiment I and 6.74-, 6.55-, and 4.86-fold in experiment II after 96 h of incubation. The addition of glyphosate stimulated the production of dissolved organic matter including tryptophan-like substances, fulvic acid-like substances, (marine) humic acid-like substances, and microcystin-leucine-arginine in the culture. In conclusion, glyphosate stimulates the proliferation of M. aeruginosa and enhances the release of dissolved organic matter in saltwater ecosystems. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-10. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Fire suppression agents are recommended for extinguishing fires by flammable liquids and frequently end in water bodies, combined with the fuels. There is a lack of toxicity information on these commercial formulations and the effects of mixtures of fire suppression agents and fuels. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the toxic effects of different fire suppression agents, the gasoline water-soluble fraction (GWSF), and mixtures of each fire suppression agent and GWSF. Individual tests were performed with Daphnia similis and Artemia sp.; the most toxic fire suppression agents to D. similis and Artemia sp. were F-500 (R), Cold Fire (R), Agefoam (R), and Kidde Sintex (R) 1%; the GWSF was the least toxic. The concentration addition model was used to predict the mixture effects and evaluate synergism/antagonism, dose ratio dependence, and dose level dependence. Cold Fire with GWSF showed dose level deviation to D. similis, marked mainly by synergism; for Artemia sp., the dose ratio pattern was predicted, with a synergistic response mainly by Cold Fire. Agefoam and GWSF behaved additively for D. similis and dose ratio for Artemia sp., with synergism being caused by Agefoam. Kidde Sintex 1% with GWSF were dose ratio for both organisms, with Kidde Sintex 1% being responsible for synergism. Our results show that some mixtures of fire suppression agents and GWSF may cause toxicity to aquatic organisms, posing risk in a real environmental scenario, such as a major fire combat.

AB Many urban lakes in Mexico City such as Lake Chapultepec are infested with high densities of cyanobacteria, particularlyMicrocystis. We tested the effect of cyanotoxins from cyanobacterial crude extracts on the demographic variables of zooplankton. The rotifersBrachionus havanaensisandBrachionus calyciflorus, and the cladoceransCeriodaphnia dubiaandMoina macrocopawere used for the assays. Temperature effects on the response ofB. calyciflorusand 2 clones ofM. macrocopawere tested. We hypothesized that with an increase in cyanotoxin concentration and temperature there would be an increase in the adverse effect on the test species and that the clone ofMoinapreviously exposed to cyanobacteria from Lake Chapultepec would be more resistant to the cyanotoxins. Demography experiments showed thatB. havanaensiswas more sensitive thanC. dubia. The negative effect of the cyanobacterial crude extract onB. calycifloruswas greater at 30 degrees C than at 20 degrees C or 25 degrees C. The strain ofM. macrocopaisolated from Lake Chapultepec was more resistant to the cyanotoxins than the strain that had not been previously exposed to the cyanobacteria. The present study indicated that cyanobacteria in Lake Chapultepec are highly toxic and, considering the recreational use of this lake, should be controlled.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-11.

AB Large-scale colony feeding studies (LSCFSs) aim to assess potential pesticide exposure to and effects on honey bees at the colony level. However, these studies are sometimes affected by high losses of control colonies, indicating that other stressors may impact colonies and confound the analysis of potential pesticide impacts. We assessed the study design and environmental conditions experienced by the untreated control colonies across 7 LSCFSs conducted in North Carolina (USA). Overwintering success differed considerably among the studies, as did their initial colony conditions, amount and timing of sugar feeding, landscape composition, and weather. To assess the effects of these drivers on control colonies' overwintering success, we applied the mechanistic colony model BEEHAVE. Sugar feedings and initial status of the simulated colonies were more important for fall colony condition than were landscape and weather. Colonies that had larger colony sizes and honey stores in the fall were those that began with larger honey stores, were provided more sugar, and had supplemental feedings before the fall. This information can be used to inform the standardization of a study design, which can increase the likelihood of overwintering survival of controls and help ensure that LSCFSs are comparable. Our study demonstrates how a mechanistic model can be used to inform study designs for higher tier effects studies.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-12.

AB Chemical pollution of surface waters is considered an important driver for recent declines in biodiversity. Species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) are commonly used to evaluate the ecological risks of chemical exposure, accounting for variation in interspecies sensitivity. However, SSDs do not reflect the effects of chemical exposure on species abundance, considered an important endpoint in biological conservation. Although complex population modeling approaches lack practical applicability when it comes to the routine practice of lower tier chemical risk assessment, in the present study we show how information from widely available laboratory toxicity tests can be used to derive the change in mean species abundance (MSA) as a function of chemical exposure. These exposure-response MSA relationships combine insights into intraspecies exposure-response relationships and population growth theory. We showcase the practical applicability of our method for cadmium, copper, and zinc, and include a quantification of the associated statistical uncertainty. For all 3 metals, we found that concentrations hazardous for 5% of the species (HC(5)s) based on MSA relationships are systematically higher than SSD-based HC(5)values. Our proposed framework can be useful to derive abundance-based ecological protective criteria for chemical exposure, and creates the opportunity to assess abundance impacts of chemical exposure in the context of various other anthropogenic stressors.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-10.

AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) often occur together as contamination in exposure media such as drinking water or food. The relative potency factor (RPF) methodology facilitates the risk assessment of mixture exposure. A database of liver endpoints was established for 16 PFAS, using data with the same species (rat), sex (male), and exposure route (oral) and comparable exposure duration (42-90 d). Dose-response analysis was applied to derive the relative potencies of 3 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (perfluorobutane sulfonic acid, perfluorohexane sulfonic acid, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), 8 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (perfluorobutanoic acid, perfluorohexanoic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid, perfluorododecanoic acid, perfluorotetradecanoic acid, perfluorohexadecanoic acid, perfluorooctadecanoic acid), 2 perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (tetrafluoro-2-[heptafluoropropoxy]propanoic acid, 3H-perfluoro-3-[(3-methoxy-propoxy)propanoic acid]), and 2 fluorotelomer alcohols (6:2 FTOH, 8:2 FTOH) compared to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), based on liver effects. In addition, the RPFs of 7 other perfluoroalkyl acids were estimated based on read-across. This resulted in the relative potencies of 22 PFAS compared to the potency of index compound PFOA. The obtained RPFs can be applied to measured PFAS quantities, resulting in the sum of PFOA equivalents in a mixture. This sum can be compared with an established PFOA concentration limit (e.g., in drinking water or food) or an external health-based guidance value (e.g., tolerable daily intake, acceptable daily intake, or reference dose) to estimate the risk resulting from direct oral exposure to mixtures. Assessing mixture exposure is particularly relevant for PFAS, with omnipresent exposure in our daily lives.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-12. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, with 9.6 million cancer-related deaths in 2018. Cancer incidence has increased over time, and so has the prescription rate of chemotherapeutic drugs. These pharmaceuticals, known as antineoplastic agents, enter the aquatic environment via human excretion and wastewater. The objectives of the present critical review were to investigate the risk of antineoplastics to aquatic species and to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding their levels in the environment, because many antineoplastics are not adequately removed during wastewater treatment. We conducted 2 separate literature reviews to synthesize data on the global environmental prevalence and toxicity of antineoplastics. The antineoplastics most frequently detected in the environment included cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, tamoxifen, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil; all were detectable in multiple water sources, including effluent and surface waters. These antineoplastics span 3 different mechanistic classes, with cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide classified as alkylating agents, tamoxifen as a hormonal agent, and methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil as antimetabolites. Studies that characterize the risk of antineoplastics released into aquatic environments are scarce. We summarize the biological impacts of the most environmentally prevalent antineoplastics on aquatic organisms and propose an adverse outcome pathway for cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, 2 widely prescribed drugs with a similar immunotoxic mode of action. Acute and chronic ecotoxicity studies using aquatic models are needed for risk characterization of antineoplastics. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-19. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB In developing countries, household energy use is highly variable and complex, yet emissions arising from fuel combustion indoors are typically poorly quantified. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are emitted during the combustion of organic fuels such as charcoal and biomass. In the present study, multichannel polydimethylsiloxane rubber traps were used for gas-phase PAH sampling and extracted using a low-solvent volume plunger-assisted solvent extraction method. Sixteen US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs, primarily in the gas phase, were investigated in indoor air of rural and urban residential homes in coastal Kenya (Mombasa and Taita Taveta Counties) using typical combustion devices of each area. Average gaseous PAH concentrations per household were higher in rural (ranging 0.81-6.09 mu g m(-3)) compared to urban (ranging 0-2.59 mu g m(-3)) homes, although ambient PAH concentrations were higher in urban environments, likely attributable to traffic contributions. The impact of fuel choice and thereby combustion device on PAH emissions was very clear, with the highest concentrations of PAHs quantified from wood-burning emissions from 3-stone stoves (total PAH averages 46.23 +/- 3.24 mu g m(-3) [n = 6]). Average benzo[a]pyrene equivalent total concentrations were evaluated for the priority PAHs and ranged from not detected to 43.31, 88.38, 309.61, and 453.88 ng m(-3) for gas, kerosene, jiko, 3-stone, and improved 3-stone stoves, respectively.

AB There is an acknowledged need in ecotoxicology for methods that integrate spatial analyses in risk assessment. This has resulted in the emergence of landscape ecotoxicology, a subdiscipline of ecotoxicology. However, landscape ecotoxicology has yet to become common practice in risk assessment due to the underdevelopment of techniques and a lack of standardized methods. In the present study, we demonstrate how geographic information systems (GISs) can serve as a standardized platform to integrate data, assess spatial patterns of ecotoxicological data for multiple species, and assess relationships between chemical mixture exposures and effects on biota for landscape ecotoxicological risks assessment. We use data collected under the Joint Oil Sands Monitoring Program in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region in Alberta, Canada. This dataset is composed of concentrations of contaminants including metals and polycyclic aromatic compounds, and health endpoints measured in 1100 biological samples, including tree swallows, amphibians, gull and tern eggs, plants, and mammals. We present 3 examples using a GIS as a platform and geospatial analysis to: 1) integrate data and assess spatial patterns of contaminant exposure in the region, 2) assess spatial patterns of exposures to complex mixtures, and 3) examine patterns of exposures and responses across the landscape. We summarize the methods used in the present study into a workflow for ease of use. The GIS methods allow researchers to identify hot spots of contamination, use georeferenced monitoring data to derive quantitative exposure-response relationships, and assess complex exposures with more realism.

AB Freshwaters are increasingly exposed to complex mixtures of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from municipal wastewater, which are known to alter freshwater communities' structure and functioning. However, their interaction with other disturbances and whether their combined effects can impact ecological resilience (i.e., the ability of a system to tolerate disturbances without altering the system's original structure and processes) remain unexplored. Using in situ mesocosms in 2 lakes with different nutrient levels (mesotrophic and eutrophic), we assessed whether a pulse exposure to sublethal concentrations of 12 PPCPs affects the ecological resilience of natural phytoplankton communities that experienced an abrupt environmental change involving the destabilization of the water column through mixing. Such mixing events are predicted to increase as the effects of climate change unfold, leading to more frequent storms, which disrupt stratification in lakes and force communities to restructure. We assessed their combined effects on community metrics (biomass, species richness, and composition) and their relative resilience using 4 indicators (cross-scale, within-scale, aggregation length, and gap length), inferred from phytoplankton communities by discontinuity analysis. The mixing disturbance alone had negligible effects on the community metrics, but when combined with chemical contaminants significant changes were measured: reducing total biomass, species richness, and altered community composition of phytoplankton. Once these changes occurred, they persisted until the end of the experiment (day 20), when the communities' structures from the 2 highest exposure levels diverged from the controls. The resilience indicators were not affected by PPCPs but differed significantly between lakes, with lower resilience found in the eutrophic lake. Thus, PPCPs can significantly alter community structures and reinforce mechanisms that maintain ecosystems in a "degraded state." Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-12. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB Although pharmaceutical pollution is a global environmental concern, much remains unknown about the transformation of pharmaceuticals in the wild and their effects on wildlife. In the environment, pharmaceuticals typically transform to some extent into different, structurally related compounds. Pharmaceutical transformation products resulting from exposure to sunlight (i.e., ultraviolet radiation) in surface waters are of particular concern; these products can be more hydrophobic, persistent, and toxic than their parent compounds. In the present study, naproxen, a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and its phototransformation products were studied to assess the overall persistence and photochemical fate of naproxen. Southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) larvae were used as model aquatic vertebrates to evaluate the acute toxicity of naproxen and its phototransformation products singly and in mixtures. The phototransformation products were observed to be more persistent and more toxic than naproxen itself. The slower phototransformation of the phototransformation products relative to naproxen suggests a greater potential to accumulate in the environment, particularly when naproxen is continually released. Mixtures of naproxen and its phototransformation products, in ratios observed during phototransformation, were more toxic than naproxen alone, as predicted by the model of concentration addition and the greater toxicity of the phototransformation products. Together, these results indicate that the ecological risk of naproxen may be underestimated by considering environmental levels of naproxen alone. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-12. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Lead (Pb) poisoning is a significant threat faced by raptors. Hence, rapid Pb diagnosis has become a priority during the admission of raptors in wildlife recovery centers, and bench-top analyzers, such as LeadCare II (R), are routinely employed for this purpose. However, this device has been designed for conducting analyses of human blood Pb levels (BLLs), and the validity of this methodology for whole blood from raptors has, to date, rarely been assessed. In addition, a recent recall by the US Food and Drug Administration has recommended discontinuing the use of this analyzer for human venous blood because it may underestimate the BLL. We evaluated the precision of BLL measurements taken with LeadCare II by comparing them with those obtained with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Our sample contained venous blood from 105 raptors belonging to 4 species. The results showed a good correlation between the 2 techniques (Spearman's r = 0.927, p < 0.0001). The mean BLL with ICP-MS was 19.6 mu g/dL; it was found to be 18.7 mu g/dL with LeadCare II. A Bland-Altman analysis indicated that the bias between the mean differences was only 0.5 mu g/dL, but it had a high standard deviation of bias (5.7 mu g/dL) and 95% limits of agreement from -10.75 to 11.74 mu g/dL. The present results indicated that LeadCare II has an overall sensitivity of 71.8% and a positive predictive value of 76.3%. The specificity of LeadCare II for detecting animals with low BLL (<3.4 mu g/dL) was 96.4%, and the negative predictive value (the probability that a value below the limit of detection of LeadCare II has a true correspondence with the actual value) was 100%. The present results indicated that, although LeadCare II might be imperfect in the estimation of BLLs in raptors, it performs reasonably well and might be employed in the clinical setting to assess patients potentially suffering from Pb poisoning.

AB The Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulted in the release of over 640 million L of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, affecting over 2000 km of shoreline, including estuaries that serve as important habitats and nurseries for aquatic species. Cyprinodon variegatus (sheepshead minnow) are small-bodied fish that inhabit northern Gulf of Mexico estuaries, are easily adaptable to laboratory conditions, and are commonly used in toxicological assessment studies. The purpose of the present study was to determine the somatic, reproductive, and developmental effects of an environmentally relevant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) mixture, the oil high-energy water accommodated fraction (HEWAF), on experimentally exposed sheepshead minnow (F-0) as well as 2 generations of offspring (F-1 and F-2) without additional exposure. The F-0 generation exposed to HEWAF had increased liver somatic indices, altered egg production, and decreased fertilization. Several developmental endpoints in the F-1 were altered by F-0 HEWAF exposure. As adults, low HEWAF-exposed F-1 females demonstrated decreased weight and length. Both the F-1 and F-2 generations derived from high HEWAF-exposed F-0 had deficits in prey capture compared to control F-1 and F-2, respectively. Correlations between endpoints and tissue PAHs provide evidence that the physiological effects observed were associated with hydrocarbon exposure. These data demonstrate that PAHs were capable of causing physiological changes in exposed adult sheepshead minnow and transgenerational effects in unexposed offspring, both of which could have population-level consequences.

AB Bioassays using the nonforced exposure approach have been shown to be a relevant tool that might complement the traditional ecotoxicological risk assessment. Because the nonforced exposure approach is based on spatial displacement of organisms and the consequent habitat selection processes, the population density might play an important role in the decision to avoid or prefer an ecosystem. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess if the avoidance response to contamination, measured in a nonforced exposure system, is density-dependent and how determinant contamination could be for the habitat-selection process in comparison with the population density. The freshwater shrimp Atyaephyra desmarestii was exposed to a copper gradient in a nonforced exposure system formed by 7 interconnected compartments (total volume 600 mL), which contained different copper concentrations. The density treatments used were 3, 5, and 10 organisms per compartment, corresponding to 0.5, 0.8, and 1.7 organisms per 100 mL, respectively. Clearly, the avoidance response to copper was more intense in the population with the lower density: the highest population density showed the lowest avoidance. The concentrations that triggered an avoidance of 50% of the population were 47, 134, and 163 mu g L-1. In summary, it was observed that shrimps were able to detect and avoid potentially toxic copper concentrations but that the avoidance response was affected by population density.

AB Monitoring of biogenic sulfide is important because acid volatile sulfides (AVS) represent a reactive pool responsible for immobilization of toxic metals. We propose a new sulfide paper sensor method for semiquantitative determination of AVS in which developed color is compared to a reference chart. The method was validated against the ion-selective microelectrode and the purge-and-trap methods. For fieldwork, readings should fall within 1 to 10 mu moles S2-. Considering that the volume of soil used ranged between 1 and 16 cm(3), the corresponding soil sulfides concentration range spans from 0.06 to 10 mmoles S2- cm(-3). The sulfide paper sensor method is highly suitable for field screening and has sensitivity levels comparable to laboratory methods. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:3025-3031. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Neonicotinoid insecticides are the most widely used class of insecticides worldwide. Concern has grown over their widespread environmental presence and potential unintended adverse effects. The present study examined hydrolysis and photolysis reaction rates of neonicotinoids and assessed any residual toxicity of reaction products. Hydrolysis rates were tested between pH 4 and 10 and found to be base-catalyzed. Experiments revealed a nonelementary rate law for hydrolysis, with the hydroxide concentration raised to a power of 0.55 +/- 0.09, which has implications for accurate prediction of environmental half-lives. Divalent metal ions (Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+) and minerals (kaolinite, goethite, TiO2) had no effect on hydrolysis rates. The hydrolysis rate in a natural water, however, was slower than that predicted by buffered experiments. Nitenpyram, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin reacted via direct photolysis in both ultrapure and natural waters, with average quantum yields of 0.024 +/- 0.001, 0.0105 +/- 0.0002, 0.0140 +/- 0.0002, and 0.0101 +/- 0.0001, respectively. Acetamiprid primarily underwent indirect photolysis by reaction with OH (1.7 +/-[0.2]x10(9)M(-1)s(-1)). For all compounds, the urea derivative was the most commonly detected product in both hydrolysis and photolysis experiments. Using mosquito (Culex pipiens) larvae, no residual toxicity of reaction products was observed. Results indicate long environmental half-lives for the tested neonicotinoids, which may help to explain their ubiquitous presence in environmental matrices. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2797-2809.

AB Bis(2-ethylhexyl) tetrabromophthalate (TBPH), a high production volume flame retardant chemical used as a replacement for banned flame retardants, has been detected in media and human and wildlife tissues globally. We describe bioaccumulation and biological effects from dietary exposure of TBPH to an estuarine fish, Atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus. Briefly, adult fish were fed carrier control or chemically amended diets for 28 d, followed by 14 d of control diet feeding. Diets were amended with TBPH (TBPH_LO diet, 139g/g dry wt, or TBPH_HI diet, 4360g/g dry wt) or a polychlorinated biphenyl congener (PCB153 diet, 13g/g dry wt), which was included as a positive control for bioaccumulation. Although bioaccumulation of either chemical correlated with fish size, only a small proportion of the TBPH offered (<0.5% total TBPH) had bioaccumulated into TBPH-treated fish by 28 d. In contrast, 24.5% of the PCB153 offered was accounted for in 28-d PCB-treated fish. Although 28-d bioaccumulated concentrations of TBPH differed by sex and treatment, sexes did not differ in their rates of TBPH bioaccumulation, and the time to achieve 50% of 28 d concentration (T-1/2) was estimated to be 13 d. Depuration rates of TBPH did not differ by sex or treatment, and the time after exposure to achieve T-1/2 was estimated to be 22 d. Independent of treatment, male fish grew faster than female fish, but for both sexes reproductive condition (gonadal somatic index) declined unexpectedly over the experimental period. Across treatments, only the TBPH_LO treatment affected growth, reducing male but increasing female growth rates by small amounts relative to respective controls. In summary, our study used very high concentrations of dietary TBPH to contaminate fish tissues above the highest levels reported to date in wild biota, yet we observed few adverse biological effects.

AB Controls governing the speciation and accumulation of Se in a 3.7-ha marsh influenced by mine drainage were assessed through examination of water balance, water quality, sediment, and plant tissue components. Over the 8-mo study period (April through November, 2009), mean monthly flows ranged from 1600 to 2300m(3)d(-1) (hydraulic retention time of 1-3d). Total Se concentrations in the marsh outflow were lower than the inflow by 0.4 to 6.2gL(-1) (mean difference=3.3gL(-1)), illustrating Se removal. The Se accumulation pathways are illustrated by elevated concentrations of Se in sediments (3-35mgkg(-1) dry wt) as well as in below-ground (2-41mgkg(-1) dry wt; mean=10mgkg(-1) dry wt) and above-ground (0.8-6.3mgkg(-1) dry wt; mean=2mgkg(-1) dry wt) emergent plant tissues. Redox stratification in the shallow water column had a marked effect on Se speciation and behavior, illustrating bottom water removal of dissolved selenate in suboxic horizons and increased mobility of dissolved organo-Se. Mass balance data yielded inflow and outflow loading rates for Se of 27 and 23gd(-1), respectively (net accumulation rate of 4gd(-1) or 0.11mgm(2)d(-1)). The rate of accumulation as calculated from the mass balance agrees with independently measured rates of Se accumulation in sediments for the site (3.6-8.1gd(-1) or 0.10-0.22mgm(-2)d(-1)).

AB The zebrafish fish embryo toxicity (FET) test is increasingly employed for alternative toxicity studies, yet our previous research identified increased sensitivity of zebrafish slightly older than embryos employed in FET methods (0-4 d postfertilization [dpf]). We identified rapid steady-state accumulation of diphenhydramine across zebrafish embryo and larval stages. However, significantly (p < 0.05) lower accumulation was observed at 48 h compared to 96 h in chorionated and dechorionated embryos (0-4 dpf), but not in zebrafish at 7 to 11 and 14 to 18 dpf. Increased uptake and toxicity of diphenhydramine was further observed in zebrafish at 7 to 11 and 14 to 18 dpf compared with 0-4 dpf embryos with chorion or dechorionated, which indicates that differential zebrafish sensitivity with age is associated with accumulation resulting from gill and other toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic changes during development.

AB There are limited data concerning the toxicity of ammonia in fresh soft waters. Ammonia toxicity is largely dependent on pH and temperature. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has derived equations to adjust species toxicity estimates based on changes in pH and temperature. It has been reported that the pH-ammonia toxicity relationship, derived by the USEPA, may differ in waters with low ionic concentrations because of the absence of potentially ameliorative ionic constituents. The present study aimed to assess the pH-ammonia toxicity relationship for the tropical green hydra, Hydra viridissima, across a range of pH values in a natural water with low ionic content. Ammonia toxicity to H. viridissima was assessed at a pH range between 6.0 and 8.5 and temperature 27.5 +/- 1 degrees C. Test solution pH was maintained using a pH buffer. The resulting median effect concentrations ranged from 9.62 (7.95-11.65) mg L-1 total ammonia nitrogen at pH 6.0 to 0.64 (0.50-0.81) mg L-1 total ammonia nitrogen at pH 7.9. The results indicated that increasing pH increased the sensitivity of H. viridissima to ammonia. The pH dependence equation derived by the USEPA accurately described the relationship between pH and ammonia toxicity for H. viridissima. However, when the model parameters for the generic pooled relationship were used, the fit was less accurate (r(2) = 0.66), indicating that the generic pooled pH-dependence equations may not be appropriate for use with this species.

AB Chemical impacts on the environment are routinely assessed in single-species tests. They are employed to measure direct effects on nontarget organisms, but indirect effects on ecological interactions can only be detected in multispecies tests. Micro- and mesocosms are more complex and environmentally realistic, yet they are less frequently used for environmental risk assessment because resource demand is high, whereas repeatability and statistical power are often low. Test systems fulfilling regulatory needs (i.e., standardization, repeatability, and replication) and the assessment of impacts on species interactions and indirect effects are lacking. In the present study we describe the development of the TriCosm, a repeatable aquatic multispecies test with 3 trophic levels and increased statistical power. High repeatability of community dynamics of 3 interacting aquatic populations (algae, Ceriodaphnia, and Hydra) was found with an average coefficient of variation of 19.5% and the ability to determine small effect sizes. The TriCosm combines benefits of both single-species tests (fulfillment of regulatory requirements) and complex multispecies tests (ecological relevance) and can be used, for instance, at an intermediate tier in environmental risk assessment. Furthermore, comparatively quickly generated population and community toxicity data can be useful for the development and testing of mechanistic effect models. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) seeds were exposed to different copper (Cu) solutions to examine plant stress responses. Low Cu concentrations (0.02 and 0.2mM) caused an increase of seed germination, whereas higher Cu amounts (2mM) significantly inhibited seed germination, delayed hypocotyl elongation, increased seedling mortality, and reduced the germination index by more than 90%. Metal-related toxicity symptoms appeared after 15 d of 2mM of Cu exposure. Biochemical activities such as amylase activity and redox balance elements were examined to study the relationship between external Cu amount and internal plant response. The present study showed that amylolytic activity was dose- and time-dependent. Likewise, H2O2 production increased after exposure to Cu, which was correlated with thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) accumulation. Furthermore at low Cu concentrations, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities increased, suggesting that date palm seed stimulated its metal homeostasis networks. However, the highest cupric ion amounts increased cell oxidant accumulation and reduced enzyme production. Gene expression level measures of P. dactylifera phytochelatin synthase (Pdpcs) and P. dactylifera metallothionein (Pdmt) encoding genes have been carried out to investigate the implication of PdPCS and PdMT proteins in Cu homeostasis and/or its sequestration. Phoenix dactylifera metallothionein induction reached a peak after 30 d of exposure to 0.2mM of Cu. However, it was down-regulated in plants exposed to higher Cu concentrations. In the same conditions, Pdpcs was overexpressed during 1 mo of exposure before it decreased thereafter. These observations provide a new insight into date palm cell response to Cu, a metal that can be toxic but that is also an essential element. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:797-806. (c) 2017 SETAC

AB One of the most abundant polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) is 2,2,4,4,5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99), which persists and potentially bioaccumulates in aquatic wildlife. Previous studies in mammals have shown that BDE-99 affects development and disrupts certain endocrine functions through signaling pathways mediated by nuclear receptors. However, fewer studies have investigated the potential of BDE-99 to interact with nuclear receptors in aquatic vertebrates such as fish. In the present study, interactions between BDE-99 and nuclear receptors were investigated by in silico and in vivo approaches. This PBDE was able to dock into the ligand-binding domain of zebrafish aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 (AhR2) and pregnane X receptor (PXR). It had a significant effect on the transcriptional profiles of genes associated with AhR or PXR. Based on the developed cytoscape of all zebrafish genes, it was also inferred that AhR and PXR could interact via cross-talk. In addition, both the in silico and in vivo approaches found that BDE-99 affected peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR), glucocorticoid receptor, and thyroid receptor. Collectively, our results demonstrate for the first time detailed in silico evidence that BDE-99 can bind to and interact with zebrafish AhR and PXR. These findings can be used to elaborate the molecular mechanism of BDE-99 and guide more objective environmental risk assessments. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:780-787. (c) 2017 SETAC

AB More than two-thirds of the world's nickel (Ni) lateritic deposits are in tropical regions, and just less than half are within South East Asia and Melanesia (SEAM). With increasing Ni mining and processing in SEAM, environmental risk assessment tools are required to ensure sustainable development. Currently, there are no tropical-specific water or sediment quality guideline values for Ni, and the appropriateness of applying guideline values derived for temperate systems (e.g., Europe) to tropical ecosystems is unknown. Databases of Ni toxicity and toxicity tests for tropical freshwater and sediment species were compiled. Nickel toxicity data were ranked, using a quality assessment, identifying data to potentially use to derive tropical-specific Ni guideline values. There were no data for Ni toxicity in tropical freshwater sediments. For tropical freshwaters, of 163 Ni toxicity values for 40 different species, high-quality chronic data, based on measured Ni concentrations, were found for just 4 species (1 microalga, 2 macrophytes, and 1 cnidarian), all of which were relevant to SEAM. These data were insufficient to calculate tropical-specific guideline values for long-term aquatic ecosystem protection in tropical regions. For derivation of high-reliability tropical-or SEAM-specific water and sediment quality guideline values, additional research effort is required. Using gap analysis, we recommend how research gaps could be filled. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Pyrethroid insecticides are commonly used in pest control and are present at toxic concentrations in surface waters of agricultural and urban areas worldwide. Monitoring is challenging as a result of their high hydrophobicity and low toxicity thresholds, which often fall below the analytical methods detection limits (MDLs). Standard daphnid bioassays used in surface water monitoring are not sensitive enough to protect more susceptible invertebrate species such as the amphipod Hyalella azteca and chemical loss during toxicity testing is of concern. In the present study, we quantified toxicity loss during storage and testing, using both natural and synthetic water, and presented a tool to enhance toxic signal strength for improved sensitivity of H. azteca toxicity tests. The average half-life during storage in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) cubitainers (Fisher Scientific) at 4 degrees C of 5 pyrethroids (permethrin, bifenthrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin, and esfenvalerate) and one organophosphate (chlorpyrifos; used as reference) was 1.4 d, and piperonyl butoxide (PBO) proved an effective tool to potentiate toxicity. We conclude that toxicity tests on ambient water samples containing these hydrophobic insecticides are likely to underestimate toxicity present in the field, and mimic short pulse rather than continuous exposures. Where these chemicals are of concern, the addition of PBO during testing can yield valuable information on their presence or absence. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB The present study examined in vitro 11-ketotestosterone and testosterone production by the testes of rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum) collected from selected reference sites and downstream of 2 municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs; Waterloo and Kitchener) on the central Grand River (Ontario, Canada), over a 6-yr period (2011-2016). The main objective was to investigate if infrastructure upgrades at the Kitchener MWWTP in 2012 resulted in a recovery of this response in the post-upgrade period (2013-2016). Two supporting studies showed that the fall season is appropriate for measuring in vitro sex steroid production because it provides stable detection of steroid patterns, and that the sample handling practiced in the present study did not introduce a bias. Infrastructure upgrades of the Kitchener MWWTP resulted in significant reductions in ammonia and estrogenicity. After the upgrades, 11-ketotestosterone production by MWWTP-exposed fish increased in 2013 and it continued to recover throughout the study period of 2014 through 2016, returning to levels measured in reference fish. Testosterone production was less sensitive and it lacked consistency. The Waterloo MWWTP underwent some minor upgrades but the level of ammonia and estrogenicity remained variable over time. The production of 11-ketotestosterone and testosterone in rainbow darter below the Waterloo MWWTP was variable and without a clear recovery pattern over the course of the present study. The results of the present study demonstrated that measuring production of sex steroids (especially 11-ketotestosterone) over multiple years can be relevant for assessing responses in fish to environmental changes such as those resulting from major infrastructure upgrades.

AB The importance of pyrethroids as potential stressors to benthic organisms has gradually become evident in urban creeks; however, the occurrence and toxicity of sediment-associated pyrethroids are rarely studied in large rivers. In this context, 10 sediments from a large urban river (Guangzhou reach of the Pearl River in China) were assessed for pyrethroid occurrence and sediment toxicity to the benthic invertebrate Chironomus dilutus. One half of the sediments exhibited lethality to C. dilutus in a 10-d exposure and all surviving midges showed significant change of enzymatic activity. Moreover, mortality occurred during a 20-d exposure for all the sediments, in accordance with the high hazard quotients to benthic species estimated from pyrethroid residues in sediment. Pyrethroids were detectable in all sediments with the concentrations ranging from 2.43 to 61.2ng/g dry weight, and permethrin and cypermethrin dominated pyrethroid composition. Acute toxic units for pyrethroids ranged from 0.03 to 0.56 (cypermethrin accounted for 13-81%) and showed a direct relationship with sediment mortality among the midges. This is consistent with the studies on small creeks in Guangzhou in which sediment-bound cypermethrin was found as a main stressor to benthic invertebrates. Comparatively, sediment toxicity and pyrethroid residues in large rivers were significantly lower than those in nearby creeks (urban tributaries). The difference may be partially explained by differing flow rates and water-carrying capacity among waterbodies at different scales; further validation is required. Overall, extensive use of pyrethroids has caused a threat to benthic species not only in small creeks but also in large rivers. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3367-3375. (c) 2017 SETAC

AB Invasive plants impact amphibians by altering habitat, altering species interactions, and releasing potentially toxic secondary chemicals. Despite being costly and having the potential to affect nontarget wildlife, chemical management is commonly used to control invasive plants. Prior research has indicated that individual effects of invasive plants or herbicides can be harmful to aquatic organisms; however, information is lacking on the combined effect of these factors on amphibians. A laboratory experiment was performed to assess the impact of leachates of the invasive plants Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) and European buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), the herbicide Renovate((R)) 3 (triclopyr [3, 5, 6-trichloro-2-pyridinyloxyacetic acid]), and the combined effects of each plant leachate and the herbicide on the growth, morphology, and survival of northern leopard frog (Lithobates pipiens) tadpoles. No effects of treatment on survival were observed. Tadpole exposure to M. spicatum reduced body mass by 17%, exposure to R. cathartica increased body mass by 36%, and exposure to R. cathartica+low herbicide increased body mass by 38% (although only early in the experiment). Exposure to Renovate 3 induced a 16% and 29% decrease in tadpole size in lower (0.22mg triclopyr active ingredient [a.i.]/L) and higher (0.92mg triclopyr a.i./L) concentration treatments, respectively. Results from the present study highlight the importance of considering both individual and combined effects of invasive plants and herbicides because they may have different outcomes for tadpole growth and development.

AB Cyanobacteria produce different toxic compounds that affect animal life, among them hepatotoxins and neurotoxins. Because cyanobacteria are able to produce a variety of toxic compounds at the same time, organisms may be, generally, subjected to their combined action. In the present study, we demonstrate the single and combined effects on cladocerans of cyanobacteria that produce microcystins (hepatotoxins) and saxitoxins (neurotoxins). Animals were exposed (either singly or combined) to 2 strains of cyanobacteria isolated from the same environment (Funil Reservoir, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The effects on clearance rate, mobility, survivorship, fecundity, population increase rate (r), and the antioxidant enzymes glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT) were measured. Cladoceran species showed a variety of responses to cyanobacterial exposures, going from no effect to impairment of swimming movement, lower survivorship, fecundity, and general fitness (r). Animals ingested cyanobacteria in all treatments, although at lower rates than good food (green algae). Antioxidant defense responses were in accordance with fitness responses, suggesting that oxidative stress may be related to such effects. The present study emphasizes the need for testing combined actions of different classes of toxins, because this is often, and most likely, the scenario in a more eutrophic world with global climatic changes.

AB In the present study, we observed that the chronic Zn Daphnia magna biotic ligand model (BLM) could not accurately predict the chronic Zn toxicity to Ceriodaphnia dubia in a series of (modified) field waters, although the intrinsic sensitivities of the D. magna BLM were specifically calibrated on the sensitivity of C. dubia. Moreover, it was observed that the D. magna BLM underestimated the effect of pH on the toxicity of the free Zn2+ ion. A preliminary species-specific chronic Zn C. dubia bioavailability model was developed based on the data. The preliminary Zn C. dubia bioavailability model was shown to predict Zn toxicity to C. dubia in a series of natural waters with pH ranging between 7 and 8.3 with reasonable accuracy. The difference in the effect of pH on Zn2+ toxicity between D. magna and C. dubia (2 phylogenetically closely related species) suggested by our results deserves further attention because of the importance of the cross-species application of bioavailability models in ecological risk-assessment procedures and environmental quality standard derivations for metals.

AB To improve the ecological relevance of environmental risk assessment, an improved understanding is needed of 1) the influence of environmental conditions on the toxicity of pollutants, and 2) the effect of these factors in combination with possible interpopulation variability. The influences of salinity and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on the accumulation and effect of copper (Cu) to settled mussels were investigated with mussels from a North Sea and a Baltic Sea population. We found that both populations were equally Cu-sensitive, even though the Baltic Sea population lives in suboptimal conditions. Baltic Sea mussels, however, accumulated more Cu. This suggests that these populations may have different ways of coping with excess Cu. The influence of salinity on Cu toxicity to settled mussels was limited for both populations. An increase in DOC did not decrease the Cu accumulation or effect in either population. This suggests that DOC-Cu complexes are bioavailable for settled mussels. These findings are in contrast with previous research which indicated that DOC decreased the toxicity and accumulation of Cu in the D-larvae life stage. As a consequence, the mussel larval stage is not the most Cu-sensitive life stage at high DOC concentrations. Furthermore, a DOC correction factor for Cu toxicity cannot be used for settled mussels. This should be accounted for in future marine Cu environmental risk assessment. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Co-occurrence of pyrethroids and metals in watersheds previously has been reported to pose great risk to aquatic species. Pyrethroids are a class of chiral insecticides that have been shown to have enantioselective toxicity and biotransformation. However, the influence of metals on enantioselectivity of pyrethroids has not yet been evaluated. In the present study, the effects of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and lead (Pb) on the enantioselective toxicity and metabolism of cis-bifenthrin (cis-BF) were investigated in zebrafish at environmentally relevant concentrations. The addition of Cd, Cu, or Pb significantly increased the mortality of zebrafish in racemate and R-enantiomer of cis-BF-treated groups. In rac-cis-BF-or 1R-cis-BF-treated groups, the addition of Cd, Cu, or Pb caused a decrease in enantiomeric fraction (EF) and an increased ratio of R-enantiomer residues in zebrafish. In 1S-cis-BF-treated groups, coexposure to Cd led to a lower EF and decreased residue levels of S-enantiomer. In addition, coexposure to the 3 metals resulted in different biodegradation characteristics of each enantiomer accompanied with differential changes in the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP)1, CYP2, and CYP3 genes, which might be responsible for the enantioselective biodegradation of cis-BF in zebrafish. These results suggest that the influence of coexistent metals should be considered in the ecological risk assessment of chiral pyrethroids in aquatic environments.

   SEDIMENTS
AB Soils from some Latin American countries support the highest biodiversity levels on the planet and simultaneously have some of the most serious environmental impacts attributed to both historical and current agricultural practices and industrial activities. Soil contamination has resulted from intensive use of pesticides, extensive mining and other industrial activities, and uncontrolled management of waste within inappropriate regulatory frameworks. The present study presents an overview of the scientific research on soil ecotoxicology conducted in Latin America, summarizing the recent advances and highlighting the needs for further refinements in this research field. Most of the contributions to the scientific literature have been from Brazil. The most investigated issue is the ecotoxicity of pesticides and earthworms, which were the organisms most frequently used as test species. Needs identified by Latin American researchers include methods and procedures for: 1) identifying and collecting natural soils to be used as reference testsubstrates in tests, 2) identifying and discerning the range of sensitivities of native test species to soil contaminants, 3) developing environmental guidelines applicable to tropical/ subtropical conditions, and 4) developing methods and procedures for higher tier testing for full development and implementation of environmental risk assessment schemes. The protection of Latin American soils, including provision of goods and services, is currently framed in legislation and other regulations, but implementation requires significant improvement and additional training programs.

AB The toxicity and bioconcentration of 3 pharmaceuticals (amitriptyline, iopamidol, and sertraline) were examined using multiple life stages (larval, juvenile, and adult) of the unionid mussel Lampsilis siliquoidea. The endpoints examined varied with life stage but included survival, behavior (algal clearance rate, filtering frequency), and oxidative stress. Iopamidol was not toxic at concentrations up to 101 mg/L. Sertraline was the most toxic chemical (50% lethal concentrations [LC50] and effect concentrations [EC50] = 0.02-0.04 mg/L), but exposure did not induce oxidative stress. Glochidia and juveniles were more sensitive than adult mussels. Algal clearance rate in juvenile mussels was the most sensitive endpoint assessed, similar to or lower than the LC50 values for glochidia. However, the compounds examined were not toxic at concentrations detected in the environment. The relative bioconcentration factors were sertraline > amitriptyline > iopamidol. These results suggest that glochidia toxicity could be a screening tool for rapidly assessing the toxicity of chemicals of concern to freshwater mussels. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The Argentinean autochthonous toad Rhinella arenarum was selected to study the chronic toxicity of arsenic (As) and the biochemical responses elicited by exposure to As in water during embryonic and larval development. Significant decreases in the total reactive antioxidant potential and in catalase activity were observed in individuals exposed chronically to sublethal concentrations of As, which is indicative of an oxidative stress situation. However, an antioxidant response was elicited during chronic exposure to As, as evidenced by the increase in endogenous reduced glutathione content and glutathione-related enzymatic activities such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase. This protective response might prevent a deeper decline in the antioxidant system and further oxidative damage. Alternatively, it might be linked to As conjugation with reduced glutathione for its excretion. Considering the sustained increase in GST activity and the decrease in the total antioxidant reactive potential observed, the authors propose them as good candidates to be used as biomarkers during As exposure. Interestingly, glutathione reductase activity was inhibited at a very low concentration of As considered safe for aquatic life. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB A comprehensive and detailed investigation of heavy metal pollution, toxicity, and ecological risk assessment was conducted for the surface river sediments of the Haihe Basin in China based on 220 sampling sites selected in 2013. The average concentrations of Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in the sediments were 129 mg/kg, 63.4 mg/kg, 36.6 mg/kg, 50.0 mg/kg, and 202 mg/kg, respectively. As indicated by the geoaccumulation and pollution load indices, most surface river sediments of the Haihe Basin were contaminated with the investigated metals, especially in the junction region of the Zi Ya He and Hei Long Gang watersheds. The 5 heavy metals in the sediments all had anthropogenic sources, and the enrichment degrees followed the order Cu > Pb > Zn > Cr > Ni, with mean enrichment factors of 3.27, 2.77, 2.58, 1.81, and 1.44, respectively. According to the mean index of comprehensive potential ecological risk (38.9), the studied sediments of the Haihe Basin showed low potential ecological risk, but the sediments were potentially biologically toxic based on the mean probable effect concentration quotient (0.547), which may be the result of speciation of the 5 metals in the sediments. The results indicate that heavy metal pollution should be considered during the development of ecological restoration strategies in the Haihe Basin. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB A probabilistic risk assessment of the potential direct and indirect effects of acute dimethoate exposure to salmon populations of concern was conducted for 3 evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) of Pacific salmon in California. These ESUs were the Sacramento River winter-run chinook, the California Central Valley spring-run chinook, and the California Central Valley steelhead. Refined acute exposures were estimated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, a river basin-scale model developed to quantify the impact of land-management practices in large, complex watersheds. Both direct effects (i.e., inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase activity) and indirect effects (i.e., altered availability of aquatic invertebrate prey) were assessed. Risk to salmon and their aquatic invertebrate prey items was determined to be de minimis. Therefore, dimethoate is not expected to have direct or indirect adverse effects on Pacific salmon in these 3 ESUs. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:532-543. (c) 2016 SETAC

AB Losses of honeybee colonies are intensely debated and although honeybees suffer multiple stressors, the main focus has been on pesticides. As a result, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) revised the guidance for pesticide risk assessment for honeybees. The European Food Safety Authority reported a protection goal of negligible effect at 7% of colony size and then used the Khoury honeybee colony model to set trigger values for forager losses. However, the Khoury model is very simplistic and simulates colonies in an idealized state. In the present study, the authors demonstrate how a more realistic published honeybee model, BEEHAVE, with a few simple changes, can be used to explore pesticide risks. The results show that forage availability interacts with pesticide-induced worker losses, and colony resilience increases with forage quality. Adding alternative unexposed forage to the landscape also substantially mitigates the effects of pesticide exposure. The results indicate that EFSA's reported protection goal of 7% of colony size and triggers for daily worker losses are overly conservative. The authors conclude that forage availability is critical for colony resilience and that with adequate forage the colonies are resilient to even high levels of worker losses. However, the authors recommend setting protection goals using suboptimal forage conditions to ensure conservatism and for such suboptimal forage, a total of 20% reduction in colony size was safe.

AB Trace elements can accumulate in aquatic food webs, becoming potentially hazardous to wildlife and human health. Whereas many studies have examined mercury dynamics in freshwater environments, evidence for the bioaccumulative potential of other trace elements (e.g., arsenic) is conflicting. Trace element concentrations found in surface water of the Red Deer River, Alberta, Canada, have raised concern for potential accumulation in aquatic biota. We investigated fish from this river to better understand the influence of biological and environmental factors in trace element bioaccumulation. We analyzed 20 trace elements, and stable nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) isotopes, in the muscle tissue of 8 species. Zinc, selenium, arsenic, chromium, and nickel were detected in the majority of fish at low concentrations. However, mercury was detected in all fish and often exceeded criteria for the protection of consumers. Body size was often positively correlated with trace element concentrations. In addition, delta N-15 and delta C-13 were correlated to mercury and arsenic concentrations, indicating that mercury biomagnifies whereas arsenic biodiminishes. Spatial patterns of fish trace element concentrations did not reflect differences in surface water concentrations. These findings indicate that fish trace element concentrations are primarily moderated by biological factors, such as trophic position and body size, and are not locally restricted to areas of relatively high environmental concentrations in the Red Deer River.

AB Aquatic systems worldwide are threatened by the anthropogenic use of synthetic chemicals, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and road de-icers. Exposure to contaminants can alter the behavior, morphology, and physiology of organisms if it occurs during sensitive life stages. For instance, past studies have documented feminization of male amphibians following herbicide exposure and skewed sex ratios among amphibian populations exposed to road salt. However, many of these studies lack the complexities found within natural environments, such as competition with conspecifics or threat of predation, which are also known to influence development. Thus, it is important to understand how anthropogenic and natural stressors interact to alter animal sex ratios. Given the growing concern of secondary salinization of freshwater systems, we exposed larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) to either road salt (sodium chloride [NaCl]) or an alternative salt mixture (NaCl, magnesium chloride [MgCl2], and potassium chloride [KCl]) at 3 concentrations (200, 600, and 1000 mg Cl-/L) crossed with 3 biotic stressors (no-stressor control, competition, or predator cues) to examine their potentially interactive effects on sex. Exposure to biotic stressors and NaCl did not influence wood frog sex ratios. In contrast, tadpole exposure to the intermediate salt mixture concentration significantly reduced the proportion of female frogs. Future studies are needed to determine whether such changes in sex are widespread among sensitive species with complex life cycles, and to assess the consequences of sex ratio changes on long-term population dynamics.

AB Microplastic pollution has become an increasingly pervasive issue worldwide, but little is known about its effects on the soil environment. A soil microcosm experiment was conducted using low-density polyethylene microplastics to estimate the effect of microplastic pollution on soil nutrient cycling and the soil microbial community structure. The results showed that microplastic addition significantly promoted soil carbon dioxide emissions but not soil nitrous oxide emissions. Soil pH, dissolved organic carbon, ammonia nitrogen, the contents of total phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), and the ratios of gram-positive bacteria to gram-negative bacteria and saturated to monounsaturated PLFAs significantly increased. In addition, nitrate nitrogen and the ratios of fungi to bacteria, total iso-branched fatty acids to total anteiso-branched fatty acids, and cyclopropyl to precursor significantly decreased with increasing microplastic addition. The addition of microplastics decreased the abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite reductase (nirS) but had little effect on the functional genes of ammonia oxidizing archaea, nitrite reductase (nirK), and nitrous oxide reductase. A principal coordinate analysis of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene and fungal internal transcribed spacer in the microplastic addition treatments revealed that the bacterial and fungal communities formed an obvious cluster. The average abundance of some microbial species with tolerance and degradability to microplastics, such as Nocardioidaceae, Amycolatopsis, Aeromicrobium, Cytophagaceae, Betaproteobacteria, Rhodoplanes, and Mortierella, in the microplastic addition treatments was significantly higher than that of the control treatment. The results suggested that microplastics have obvious influences on microbial communities and may affect global carbon and nitrogen cycles. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-14. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that have systemic effects that are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. Environmental chemicals that disrupt glucocorticoid receptor signaling and/or glucocorticoid homeostasis could adversely affect the health of human and nonhuman vertebrates. A major challenge in identifying environmental chemicals that alter glucocorticoid receptor signaling and/or glucocorticoid homeostasis is a lack of adequate screening methods. We developed a cell-based bioassay to measure total glucocorticogenic activity (TGA) of environmental chemicals and human serum. Human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were stably transfected with a luciferase reporter gene driven by 3 tandem glucocorticoid-response elements. Dose-response curves for 6 glucocorticoids and 4 non-glucocorticoid steroid hormones were generated to evaluate the specificity of the bioassay. Cells were also optimized to measure TGA of 176 structurally diverse environmental chemicals and human serum samples in a high-throughput format. Reporter activity was glucocorticoid-specific and induced 400-fold by 1 mu M dexamethasone. Furthermore, 3 of the screened chemicals (3,4,4 '-trichlorocarbanilide, isopropyl-N-phenylcarbamate, and benzothiazole derivative 2-[4-chlorophenyl]-benzothiazole) potentiated cortisol-induced glucocorticoid receptor activity. Serum TGA estimates from the bioassay were highly correlated with a cortisol enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The present study establishes an in vitro method to rapidly screen environmental chemicals and human serum for altered glucocorticogenic activity. Future studies can utilize this tool to quantify the joint effect of endogenous glucocorticoids and environmental chemicals. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-10. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB To evaluate the potential impact of an urban wastewater-treatment plant on Ria Formosa coastal lagoon, a sentinel species, the clam Ruditapes decussatus, was exposed along a gradient of the effluent's dispersal for 1 mo. Three exposure sites were selected to study the responses of 3 biomarkers: electron transport system, acetylcholinesterase, and lipid peroxidation. As complementary data, morphometric measurements, condition index, and lipid and protein content were considered together with in situ physicochemical characterization of the sites (temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen). Electron transport system activity levels were between 35.7 and 50.5 nmol O-2/min g protein, acetylcholinesterase activity levels ranged from 2.6 to 3.8 nmol/min g protein, and lipid peroxidation ranged from 174.7 to 246.4 nmol malondialdehyde/g protein. The exposure sites shaped the response not only of biomarkers but also of "health" parameters (protein, lipids, and condition index). Lipid peroxidation was the most responsive biomarker also associated with electron transport system, especially at the closest site to the urban wastewater-treatment plant. Because of the presence of complex mixtures of contaminants in urban effluents, biomarker responses can provide valuable information in environmental assessment. However, it is vital to identify all biological and ecological factors induced by the natural life cycle of clams. Abiotic factors can mask or overlap the response of biomarkers and should be considered in a multibiomarker approach. (C) 2020 SETAC

AB The absence of chronic toxicity data for tropical marine waters has limited our ability to derive appropriate water quality guideline values for metals in tropical regions. To aid environmental management, temperate data are usually extrapolated to other climatic (e.g., tropical) regions. However, differences in climate, water chemistry, and endemic biota between temperate and tropical systems make such extrapolations uncertain. Chronic nickel (Ni) toxicity data were compiled for temperate (24 species) and tropical (16 species) marine biota and their sensitivities to Ni compared. Concentrations to cause a 10% effect for temperate biota ranged from 2.9 to 20 300 mu g Ni/L, with sea urchin larval development being the most sensitive endpoint. Values for tropical data ranged from 5.5 to 3700 mu g Ni/L, with copepod early-life stage development being the most sensitive test. There was little difference in temperate and tropical marine sensitivities to Ni, with 5% hazardous concentrations (95% confidence interval) of 4.4 (1.8-17), 9.6 (1.7-26), and 5.8 (2.8-15) mu g Ni/L for temperate, tropical, and combined temperate and tropical species, respectively. To ensure greater taxonomic coverage and based on guidance provided in Australia and New Zealand, it is recommended that the combined data set be used as the basis to generate a jurisdiction-specific water quality guideline of 6 mu g Ni/L for 95% species protection applicable to both temperate and tropical marine environments.

AB Intrinsic/inherent chemical properties are characteristic, irrespective of the number of molecules present. However, toxicity is an extensive/extrinsic biochemical property that depends on the number of molecules. Paracelsus, often considered the father of toxicology, noted that all things are poisonous. Because dose magnitude (i.e., number of molecules) determines the occurrence of poisonous effects, toxicity cannot be an intrinsic/inherent biochemical property. Thus, toxicology's task is to determine case-specific risks resulting in adverse effects produced by the interaction of toxic doses/exposures, toxic mechanisms, and case-specific influencing factors. Experimental testing results are known to vary within and between chemicals, test organisms, and experimental conditions and repetitions; however, hazard-based approaches treat toxicity as a fixed and constant property. A logical alternative is the standard-risk, case-specific risk model. In this approach, testing data are defined as standard risks where the nature, magnitude, and toxicity effect is standardized to the organism, chemical, and test conditions. Interpolation/extrapolation of standard risks to site-specific conditions (i.e., case-specific risks) is challenging, requiring understanding of the influences of the complex interactions within and between differing species, conditions, and toxicity-modifying factors. Therefore, Paracelsus's paradigm is perhaps better abbreviated as "dose-causality-response", because a key interpretive requirement is establishing toxicity causality by separating mode/mechanism of toxic action from modifying factor influences in overall toxicity responses. Unfortunately, the current knowledge base is inadequate. Moving to a standard-risk-specific-risk paradigm would highlight the importance of improving the toxicity causality knowledge base. Thereby, a rationale would be provided for enhancing the design and interpretation of toxicity testing that is necessary for achieving advances in routine translation of standard-risk to specific-risk estimates-the raison d'etre of regulatory risk decision making.

AB Concentrations in fish of perfluorocarboxylic and perfluorosulfonic acids were reported for 7 deep lakes in the European subalpine area: Lakes Geneva, Lugano, Maggiore, Iseo, Como, Garda, and Mergozzo; one shallow lowland lake (Varese); and 2 high-altitude alpine lakes (>2000 m a.s.l). Fillets and, in selected cases, other body fractions (viscera, liver, and residual carcass) from 8 fish species were analyzed. The possibility of harmonizing the monitoring protocols was tested. Results suggest that the sampling season is not critical for PFASs and the total protein content cannot be used for normalization of tissue concentrations because PFASs bind to specific proteins. Moreover, the polar lipid content could be used to reduce the variability of PFAS concentrations in phospholipid rich fractions of fish such as viscera and carcass. The data comparison and analysis show that the PFAS contamination in lake fish is generally correlated with the degree of urbanization of the lake catchment; however, it is sometimes difficult to compare absolute concentrations in lake fish because the lake hydro-morphological characteristics play a substantial role in determining the chemical concentrations of persistent and mobile contaminants.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-19.

AB Wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs) are regarded as one of the main sources of antibiotics in the environment. In the present study, the concentrations of multiple antibiotics and their metabolites belonging to 5 antibiotic classes were determined in 3 major Finnish WWTPs. An online solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was used for the extraction and analysis of the compounds. The method was fully validated using real and synthetic wastewaters. Seven antibiotics and 3 metabolites were found in the analyzed samples. Sulfonamides were removed most efficiently, whereas macrolides usually showed negative removal efficiency during the treatment, which means that the concentrations for individual antibiotics determined in the effluent samples were higher than in the influent samples. Sulfadiazine was found at concentrations up to 1018 ng/L, which was the highest concentration of any of the detected antibiotics in influent. In the effluent samples, the highest mean concentration was found for trimethoprim (532 ng/L). The measured mass loads of the antibiotics and metabolites to the receiving waters ranged from 2 to 157 mg/d per 1000 population equivalent. The evaluated environmental risk assessment showed that clarithromycin and erythromycin might pose a risk to the environment. The present study further underlines the importance of implementing technology for efficient removal of xenobiotics during wastewater treatment.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-16.

AB The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and several states are considering regulatory limits for hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) <100 ng/L, increasing the importance of obtaining accurate and reliable data. The present study presents the results of 2 studies investigating the effectiveness of chemical preservation on ng/L concentrations of Cr(VI) in groundwater. Chemically preserved and unpreserved aliquots of a groundwater sample were spiked with a known amount of Cr(VI), and then analyzed in tandem with sets of preserved and unpreserved performance test samples over 28 d. The studies showed that although Cr(VI) appears to be relatively stable over 28 d, it may be sensitive to minor matrix changes after collection. The studies also demonstrated significant challenges to measuring Cr(VI) below 100 ng/L, because the results can be subject to positive bias or contamination that may not be readily apparent. We conclude that Cr(VI) measurements using a USEPA published method below 100 ng/L may be categorized as semiquantitative at best.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-8. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Standard ecological risk assessment practices often rely on larval and juvenile fish toxicity data as representative of the amphibian aquatic phase. Empirical evidence suggests that endpoints measured in fish early life stage tests are often sufficient to protect larval amphibians. However, the process of amphibian metamorphosis relies on endocrine cues that affect development and morphological restructuring and are not represented by these test endpoints. The present study compares developmental endpoints for zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), 2 standard test species, exposed to the herbicide trifluralin throughout the larval period.Danio reriowere more sensitive and demonstrated a reduction in growth measurements with increasing trifluralin exposure. Size ofX. laevisat metamorphosis was not correlated with exposure concentration; however, time to metamorphosis was delayed relative to trifluralin concentration. Gene expression patterns indicate discrepancies in response byD. rerioandX. laevis, and dose-dependent metabolic activity suggests that trifluralin exposure perturbed biological pathways differently within the 2 species. Although many metabolites were correlated with exposure concentration inD. rerio, nontargeted hepatic metabolomics identified a subset of metabolites that exhibited a nonmonotonic response to trifluralin exposure inX. laevis. Linking taxonomic distinctions in cellular-level response with ecologically relevant endpoints will refine assumptions used in interspecies extrapolation of standard test effects and improve assessment of sublethal impacts on amphibian populations.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-16.

AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been used in aqueous film-forming foams used in firefighting, resulting in soil and groundwater contamination and leading to human exposure via animal products grown in contaminated areas. The present study reports the relationship between PFAS intake by hens and the PFAS concentrations in the edible parts of eggs. Laying hens were exposed via drinking water to different concentrations of 4 PFAS compounds (perfluorooctane sulfonate [PFOS], perfluorohexane sulfonate [PFHxS], perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA], and perfluorohexanoic acid) over 61 d. Egg PFAS residues were assessed for a further 30 d after exposure ceased. The target concentrations of PFAS were 0, 0.3, 3, 30, and 300 mu g/L for the treatment groups T1-T5, respectively; and PFAS residues were determined from the eggs collected every second day. There was a linear correlation between the PFAS concentrations in the drinking water of hens and those detected in the egg, which could be useful in estimating PFAS concentrations in the egg by measuring water concentrations. Exposure of hens to drinking water with PFAS concentrations below the Australian Government Department of Health limits (PFOS and PFHxS, 0.07 mu g/L; PFOA, 0.56 mu g/L), and with no other sources of PFAS exposure, is unlikely to result in egg PFAS concentrations that would exceed the 10% limit set by Food Standards Australia New Zealand for human consumption.

AB A bleached kraft pulp mill discharging effluent to the Mattagami River in northern Ontario, Canada, closed after almost 90 yr of operation. During its operation, effluent from the mill influenced biota in the downstream areas. To assess shifts in the reliance of biota from mill-derived nutrients, the isotopic composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) muscle and whole mayflies (Hexagenia sp.) were compared before (1990s) and after the pulp mill's closure (2012-2014). To better understand other potential sources of spatial and temporal change, samples from 3 other tributaries in the basin with dams, ongoing pulp mill operations, sites receiving sewage, and at several reference sites were collected and compared. Irrespective of time period, biota collected at sites downstream of both dams and active pulp mills tended to have elevated delta C-13 values, but variable changes in delta N-15 (negligible in most cases) when compared with upstream samples. The isotopic composition of mayflies varied at reference sites over time, with decreasing values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 (mayflies only) with increasing depth, and there was evidence of lower delta C-13 in fish after the pulp mill closure. Overall, these results suggest the importance of long-term, regional-scale measurements for documenting the effects of stressors on nutrient use by aquatic species. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-12.

AB Phthalate derivatives with low estrogenic activity, high infrared spectrum signals, high Raman characteristic vibration spectrum, high fluorescence intensity, and high ultraviolet sensitivity were selected as precursors from our previous studies, so that the changes in their toxicity and estrogenic activity during biological metabolism, ozone oxidation, photocatalytic degradation, photodegradation, and microbial degradation could be studied.The transformation pathways of these derivatives were simulated, and the reaction energy barriers were calculated. To determine the potential environmental risks of these phthalate derivatives, the pharmacophore models of biotoxicity and estrogen activity of phthalates were used to predict the biotoxicity and estrogen activity of the transformed products. The results showed an increase in the biotoxicity and estrogen activity of the biometabolites, ozonation products, photocatalytic degradation products, and microbial degradation products; the only products that did not follow this trend were the photodegradation products. Notably, the pathways that produced more potentially toxic compounds were the less favorable paths. Our results indicate that the transformation products of the designed environmentally friendly phthalate derivatives potentially pose environmental risks. To avoid such risks, the environmental transformation pathway of these derivatives should be simulated to screen for environmentally friendly phthalate molecules. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-11.

AB A simplified ecosystem model, the Aquatic Tritrophic Ecological Risk Assessment Model (A-TERAM), for the ecological risk assessment of chemicals is presented. The A-TERAM comprises a linear grazer food chain with 3 trophic levels (the algae-Daphnia-fish system). The model simulates the seasonal patterns of abundance at each level observed in the field, and it translates the direct toxic effects of chemicals on algae or Daphnia to implications for fish via ecological interactions; thus, the A-TERAM evaluates ecological risk in terms of the annual population growth rate of fish. The model also incorporates toxicokinetics for fish. The minimum input data required for the A-TERAM are basic ecotoxicity endpoints (algal growth inhibition median effect concentration [EC50] or no-observed effect concentration, Daphnia immobility EC50, and fish acute mortality median lethal concentration); however, additional ecotoxicity data (Daphnia reproduction test, fish early life test, and fish reproduction test) are also relevant for improving simulations. Comparisons made across 496 chemicals (255 nonagricultural chemicals and 241 agrochemicals) indicated that the A-TERAM, in comparison with the conventional predicted-effect concentration/predicted-no-effect concentration method, tended to evaluate higher risk to chemicals that are highly bioaccumulative and toxic to fish by 2 orders of magnitude at the largest but lower or comparable risk to chemicals that are toxic only to algae or Daphnia.

AB Elevated levels of lead have been found in waterfowl, due to human activities. Lead may cause immunomodulatory effects, but the mechanisms are largely unknown, especially after viral challenges. To characterize avian immunomodulatory hazards of lead (Pb)(2+), we used chicken macrophage (HD-11) and B-lymphocyte (DT40) cell lines, as in vitro models for the innate and adaptive immune systems, respectively. The cells were activated via toll-like receptor-3 by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium salt (poly I:C), mimicking viral infections. Our results indicate that Pb2+ is cytotoxic to both cell lines, macrophages being more sensitive. De novo synthesis of glutathione plays an important role in protecting macrophages from Pb2+ intoxication, which might also be closely involved in the induction of nitric oxide after Pb2+ exposure. Stimulatory effects on cell proliferation were noticed at noncytotoxic Pb2+ concentrations as well. Exposure to Pb2+ could also affect the inflammatory status by inhibiting the pro-inflammatory interferon (IFN)-gamma while promoting the production of anti-inflammatory type I IFNs in both macrophages and B-cells, and increasing intracellular IgM levels in B-cells. These results suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of Pb2+ in birds are probably closely associated with disruption of immune cell proliferation and cytokine production, potentially causing disorders of the avian immune system.

AB To fully assess the long-term impacts of oil spills like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident in the northern Gulf of Mexico, the potential for organisms other than microbes to affect the fate and distribution of the oil may have to be considered. This influence could be substantial for abundant bioturbating benthic animals like the ghost shrimp Lepidophthalmus louisianensis. An assessment of the influence of these ghost shrimp on petroleum hydrocarbons was conducted in laboratory micro- and mesocosms containing coastal Gulf of Mexico sediment, seawater, and oil or the polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pyrene. In an experiment with pyrene added to the water column, the ghost shrimp presence lowered water-column pyrene concentrations. In an experiment with oil added to the sediment surface, the ghost shrimp presence decreased PAH concentrations in the sediment surface layer but increased these in the water column and subsurface sediment. A companion study and a mass-balance analysis indicated a net loss of PAHs through an enhancement of microbial degradation. In an experiment in which oil was added as a narrow subsurface layer in the sediment, the ghost shrimp presence appeared to broaden the oil's depth distribution. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ghost shrimp can significantly influence the biodegradation and distribution of spilled oil in coastal ecosystems. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-11.

AB A Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry technical workshop was held in December 2017 to critically evaluate the current state of the science of metal bioavailability modeling. The availability of mechanistic models such as the biotic ligand model and the rapid development of empirical models such as multiple linear regressions means that choices are available in terms of bioavailability normalization approaches that can be used in metal risk assessments and the development of risk-based protective values for aquatic life. A key goal of the workshop was to provide potential users of metal bioavailability models with the information required to make appropriate decisions when choosing among mechanistic and empirical models. Workshop participants focused on the state of the science of metal bioavailability modeling, mechanistic and empirical model frameworks, validation of bioavailability models, and application of bioavailability models in risk-based decision-making approaches. The output of this workshop provides the necessary scientific information to incorporate bioavailability normalization in regulations pertaining to metals in freshwater systems.

AB An accurate and sensitive method has been developed for determination of the herbicide isoproturon using the Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged Safe (QuEChERS) extraction-spectrofluorimetric technique. The method involves the reaction of 2-cyanoacetamide with isoproturon in basic medium (NH3; 15 mol/L). The resulting fluorescent product was found to show maximum emission at 378 nm and maximum excitation at 333 nm. Fluorescence intensity under the influence of different parameters was investigated. The linear range of analyte concentrations was found to be 0.5 to 15 mu g/mL, with a limit of detection of 0.144 mu g/mL, a limit of quantification of 0.437 mu g/mL (signal to noise ratio = 3), and a regression coefficient of 0.9991, under optimized conditions. The proposed method was effectively applied for determination of isoproturon in different matrices; the percentage of recovery varied from 85.00 +/- 1.2% to 96.00 +/- 0.5%. The method was also applied for residue analysis of isoproturon in real soil samples collected from a pilot field. For extraction of isoproturon, the QuEChERS extraction approach was used, and the average residue in the soil samples was found to be 0.81 +/- 0.07 mu g/g. To show the potential of this approach, our results were compared with those of other methods reported in the literature. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-7. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB A time series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) data was collected for Gulf of Mexico demersal fishes in the years following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (2012-2017). Tilefish (Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps) were sampled via demersal longline at repeat stations in the northern Gulf of Mexico in 2012 to 2015 and 2017. Bile samples (n = 256) were analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection for PAH metabolites as a biomarker of exposure to PAHs. Liver tissues (n = 230) were analyzed for accumulation of PAHs and alkylated homologs via quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extractions and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry quantification. Over the 6-yr time series, exposure to petrogenic PAHs increased by an average of 178%, correlating with an average 22% decline in Fulton's condition factor. The decline in Fulton's condition factor was positively correlated with a 53% decline in percentage of liver lipid. There was no accumulation of PAHs in liver tissue over time. Together, these results suggest that increasing and chronic PAH exposure and metabolism may be taxing the energy budgets of tilefish, particularly adult females, with potentially negative impacts on fitness.

AB An environmental risk assessment is presented for mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunosuppressive pharmaceutical used for prevention of organ rejection, and its prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MPM). Mycophenolic acid will not significantly adsorb to activated sludge. In activated sludge, C-14-MPA attained >80% degradation, supporting an older environmental fate test with the same compound. Based on n-octanol/water distribution coefficient (log D-OW) values of 2.28, 0.48, and <=-1.54 at pH 5, 7, and 9, respectively, MPA is not expected to bioaccumulate. Sales amounts of MPA+MPM in Europe were used to derive predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in surface waters; PECs were refined by including expected biodegradation in sewage treatment, average drinking water use, and average dilution of the effluents in the receiving waters per country. In addition, the exposure to pharmaceuticals in the environment (ePiE) model was run for 4 European catchments. The PECs were complemented with 110 measured environmental concentrations (MECs), ranging from below the limit of quantitation (<0.001 mu g/L) to 0.656 mu g/L. Predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) were derived from chronic tests with cyanobacteria, green algae, daphnids, and fish. The comparison of PECs and MECs with the PNECs resulted in a differentiated environmental risk assessment in which the risk ratio of PEC/PNEC or MEC/PNEC was <1 in most cases (mostly >90%), meaning no significant risk, but a potential risk to aquatic organisms in generally <10% of instances. Because this assessment reveals a partial risk, the following questions must be asked: How much risk is acceptable? and Through which measures can this risk be reduced? These questions are all the more important in view of limited alternatives for MPM and MPA and the serious consequences of not using them. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2259-2278.

AB Pesticide risk assessment for "listed" (threatened and endangered) plant species is hampered by a lack of quantitative demographic information. Demographic information for nonlisted plant species could provide risk-assessment data and inform recovery plans for listed species; however, it is unclear how representative demography of the former would be for the latter. We performed a comparison of plant demographic traits and elasticity metrics to explore how similar these are between listed and nonlisted species. We used transition matrices from the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database to calculate population growth rate (lambda), net reproductive rate (R-o), generation time (T-g), damping ratio (rho), and summed elasticities for survival (stasis), growth, fertility (reproduction), and evenness of elasticity (EE). We compared these across species varying in conservation status and population trend. Phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) models were used to evaluate differences between listed and nonlisted plants. Overall, demographic traits were largely overlapping for listed and nonlisted species. Population trends had a significant impact on most demographic traits and elasticity patterns. The influence of T-g on elasticity metrics was consistent across all data groupings. In contrast, the influence of lambda on elasticity metrics was highly variable, and correlated in opposite directions in growing and declining populations. Our results suggested that population models developed for nonlisted plant species may be useful for assessing the risks of pesticides to listed species. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019:1-10.

AB We examined the relationships among tuna consumption, hair mercury levels, and knowledge of mercury exposure risk from tuna consumption in university students that were offered tuna daily at university-run dining halls. Hair total mercury levels in tuna consumers were higher than those in non-tuna consumers (average = 0.466 mu g/g +/- 0.328 standard deviation [SD], n = 20 vs 0.110 mu g/g +/- 0.105 SD, n = 33, respectively; p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test), with tuna eaters exhibiting a positive relationship between self-reported tuna consumption at dining halls and hair mercury levels (R-2 = 0.868, p < 0.0001, n = 17, linear regression). For all tuna eaters surveyed, more than half (54%) self-reported eating >= 3 tuna meals/wk, potentially exceeding the US Environmental Protection Agency's reference dose for methylmercury of 0.1 mu g/kg body weight/d. Seven percent of study participants reported they consumed >20 tuna meals/wk, which was related to hair mercury levels >1 mu g/g, a level of concern. Study participants had an overall lack of knowledge and confidence in their knowledge about mercury exposure risk from tuna consumption, with >99% of participants reporting low knowledge and low confidence in survey answers. Our study highlights the importance of education about the risks of tuna consumption, particularly in institutional settings where individuals have unlimited access to tuna products.

AB Analyses of natural waters frequently show elevated levels of total aluminum (Al) attributable to acid extraction of Al from the total suspended solids (TSS) minerals. Hence, there is a need for an analytical method that measures only bioavailable Al. Natural waters high in TSS were collected to study the chronic effects of Al on Ceriodaphnia dubia. In the collected waters TSS ranged from 30 to 411 mg/L; total Al concentrations ranged from 2.0 to 44.8 mg/L. The TSS in natural waters inhibited reproduction of C. dubia up to 40% in comparison to the same filtered waters. This inhibition did not correlate with the concentration of TSS or total Al; it was attributed to nutritional deficiency and was prevented by increasing the food supply. To demonstrate that toxicity can be measured in natural waters, samples with elevated TSS were spiked with soluble Al, and survival and reproduction were measured in chronic studies performed at pH 6.3 and 8.0. To properly characterize the Al concentrations in the toxicity studies, a method was needed that could discriminate bioavailable Al from mineral forms of Al. An extraction method at pH 4 for bioavailable Al was developed and evaluated using C. dubia chronic toxicity studies in the presence of TSS. It is concluded that the proposed method is better able to discriminate chronic toxicity effects attributable to bioavailable Al from mineralized nontoxic forms of Al compared with existing methods using total or total recoverable Al (i.e., extraction at pH <= 1.5). We propose that this new method be used when assessing the potential for Al in natural surface waters to cause toxicity. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1668-1681. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB To estimate mixture effects caused by the high number of chemicals simultaneously present in the environment, methods for routine effect assessment of environmentally realistic contaminant mixtures are needed. We repeatedly exposed the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum to Speedisk(TM) passive sampler extracts and observed statistically significant growth stimulation up to 6 and 7% for samples from inside and outside the harbor of Zeebrugge, respectively. These effects were found at summed contaminant concentrations (159-166 ng L-1) that were within a 1.1- to 2.4-fold range of those observed in grab water samples taken during sampler deployment. These stimulatory effects were confirmed in 2 independent tests with extracts stored for <1 or 8 mo that had undergone limited sample handling, whereas no effects were observed for extracts that had been stored for 16 mo that had undergone repeated handling (notably repeated freezing and thawing) before biotest spiking. Targeted analysis by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify 88 personal care products (n = 8), pesticides (n = 28), and pharmaceuticals (n = 52). Among these compounds, multivariate statistical analysis put forward the beta-blocker atenolol as explaining most of the observed variation in mixture composition between the growth-stimulating and no effect-causing extracts. However, when tested individually over the entire concentration range present in the extracts, atenolol did not have any effect on P. tricornutum, suggesting that nontargeted substances in the extracts may have contributed to the observed stimulatory effects. Nevertheless, the present study shows that exposure to contaminant mixtures at environmentally realistic concentrations can lead to small but significant growth stimulation effects on the marine diatom P. tricornutum.

AB It is well known that temperature can affect the ecotoxicity of chemicals (including metals) to aquatic organisms. It was recently reported that nickel (Ni), a priority substance under the European Water Framework directive, showed decreasing chronic toxicity to Daphnia magna with increasing temperature, between 15 and 25 degrees C. We performed a toxicokinetic study to contribute to an increased mechanistic understanding of this effect. More specifically, we investigated the effect of temperature on Ni uptake and elimination in D. magna (in 4 clones) using an experimental design that included Ni exposures with different stable isotopic composition and using a one-compartment model for data analysis. Both Ni uptake and elimination were affected by temperature, and some clear interclonal differences were observed. On average (across all clones), however, a similar pattern of the effect of temperature was observed on both Ni uptake and elimination, that is, the uptake rate constant (k(u)) and elimination rate constant (k(e)) during 72 h of Ni exposure were lower at 25 than at 19 degrees C, by 2.6-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively, and they were similar at 19 and 15 degrees C. This pattern does not correspond to the effects of temperature on chronic Ni toxicity reported previously, suggesting that Ni compartmentalization and/or toxicodynamics may also be affected by temperature. The data gathered with our specific experimental design also allowed us to infer that 1) the k(u) was up-regulated over time, that is, the k(u) after 2 d of Ni exposure was significantly higher than the initial k(u), by 1.5- to 2.3-fold, and 2) the k(e) decreased significantly when the external Ni exposure was stopped, by 1.2- to 1.9-fold. These 2 findings are in contrast with 2 commonly used assumptions in toxicokinetic models, that is, that k(u) is constant during exposure and k(e) is independent of external exposure. We suggest that future toxicokinetic studies consider these factors in their experimental designs and data analyses. Overall, our study contributes to the growing body of evidence that temperature affects toxicokinetics of metals (and chemicals in general), but at the same time we emphasize that knowledge of toxicokinetics alone is not necessarily sufficient to explain or predict temperature effects on (chronic) toxicity.

AB A 2-tier standardized protocol was designed to test the toxicity of microplastics to planktonic organisms. This approach uses sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) and copepod (Acartia clausi) larvae because they are common biological models in marine research, and standard methods for toxicity testing with regulatory applications are available. In Tier I, leachates obtained at a 100 to 1 liquid to solid ratio are tested, and toxic units are calculated using a probit dose-response model to quantify the toxicity of the plastics. In Tier II, which is conducted only if significant toxicity (> 1 toxic unit) is found in Tier I, particles less than 20 mu m in size are tested at concentrations between 0.1 and 10 mg L-1, and a toxicity threshold suitable for ranking materials according to their toxicity is obtained from the 10% effect concentration (EC10) values. Results point to chemical additives as being responsible for the toxicity found in certain plastic materials. This process is suitable for both a priori identification of the hazard posed by plastic objects in the aquatic environment, and a posteriori assessment of environmental risk caused by microplastic pollution. The method also provides a quantitative procedure appropriate for ranking plastic materials according to their toxicity to aquatic organisms. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:630-637. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Potential differences in species susceptibility to nanoparticle (NP) contaminants make the use of multispecies community toxicity testing strategies beneficial in understanding NP risk to aquatic environments. Because of the limited knowledge of zinc oxide (ZnO) NP fate and toxicity, we conducted multispecies exposures and compared the responses of individual species to the same species in a community comprised of algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), bacteria (Escherichia coli), crustaceans (Daphnia magna), and zebrafish (Danio rerio). Different-sized ZnO particles and ionic Zn were compared to investigate the contribution of particulate and dissolved Zn to aquatic organism toxicity. Each organism and community was exposed to Zn sources at 0.08, 0.8, and 8 mg Zn/L. The present results indicate that all 3 types of Zn elicited differential toxicity among test organisms, with stronger adverse outcomes observed in single species than within a community. The community assay (nanocosm) we developed increased resilience to all Zn exposures by 5 to 10% compared to individual exposures at equivalent concentrations. In addition, the uptake and toxicity of ZnO particles to aquatic communities appear to be driven by rapid dissolution and the concomitant impacts of zinc ion toxicity, and the size of the ZnO particles had little impact on uptake or toxicity. The nanocosm assay could be a useful screening tool for rapidly assessing the potential impacts of nanomaterials to aquatic species. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:591-602. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB Environmental risk assessment (ERA) methodologies for consumer product chemicals are well established in most developed regions including the United States, Canada, and the European Union. However, such methodologies are not yet fully developed for emerging economies, such as China. The objective of the present study was to develop an ERA framework involving an exposure methodology using conditions specific to China (i.e., physical setting, infrastructure, and consumers' habits and practice). Incorporated in this newly developed ERA framework for assessing consumer product chemicals were China's current regulatory screening and prioritization schemes as part of a tiered risk assessment approach. The framework started with tier 0, which utilized the existing Chinese regulatory qualitative method; tiers 1 and 2 were quantitative, and used deterministic and probabilistic methods that accounted for per capita residential water usage, wastewater treatment capability, and wastewater/in-stream dilution factors. Due to major differences in wastewater treatment infrastructure and water usage between urban versus rural regions in China, 2 scenarios were identified for quantitatively assessing environmental exposure: 1) urban with wastewater treatment, and 2) rural without wastewater treatment (i.e., direct discharge of wastewater). Our study presents the methodology of the framework with its technical rationale and the companion model Chera, and also provides an overview of the current status of ERA research in China.

AB A key success factor for the performance of passive samplers is the proper calibration of sampling rates. Sampling rates for a wide range of polar organic compounds are available for Chemcatchers and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS), but the mechanistic models that are needed to understand the effects of exposure conditions on sampling rates need improvement. Literature data on atrazine sampling rates by these samplers were reviewed with the aim of assessing what can be learned from literature reports of this well-studied compound and identifying knowledge gaps related to the effects of flow and temperature. The flow dependency of sampling rates could be described by a mass transfer resistance model with 1 (POCIS) or 2 (Chemcatcher) adjustable parameters. Literature data were insufficient to evaluate the temperature effect on the sampling rates. An evaluation of reported sampler configurations showed that standardization of sampler design can be improved: for POCIS with respect to surface area and sorbent mass, and for Chemcatcher with respect to housing design. Several reports on atrazine sampling could not be used because the experimental setups were insufficiently described with respect to flow conditions. Recommendations are made for standardization of sampler layout and documentation of flow conditions in calibration studies. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:1786-1798. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Two mesocosm experiments were conducted to examine effects of ferric iron (Fe) and mixtures of ferric Fe with aqueous metals (Cu, Zn) on stream benthic communities. Naturally colonized benthic communities were exposed to a gradient of ferric Fe (0, 0.4, 1.0, 2.5, 6.2, and 15.6 mg/L) that bracketed the current US Environmental Protection Agency water quality criterion value (1.0 mg/L). After 10d of exposure to ferric Fe, total macroinvertebrate abundance, number of taxa, and abundance of all major macroinvertebrate groups (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and Diptera) were significantly reduced. Heptageniid mayflies and chironomids were especially sensitive to Fe oxide deposition and were significantly reduced at 0.4 and 1.0mg/L total Fe, respectively. In a second mesocosm experiment, periphyton and macroinvertebrate communities were exposed to ferric Fe (0.60 mg/L) with or without aqueous Cu and Zn at 2 treatment levels: low (0.01 mg/L Cu+0.1 mg/L Zn) and high (0.05 mg/L Cu + 0.5 mg/L Zn). In contrast to previous research, we observed no evidence of a protective effect of Fe on toxicity of metals. Growth rates and protein content of periphyton were significantly reduced by both ferric Fe and aqueous metals, whereas abundance of heptageniid mayflies (Cinygmula) and whole community metabolism were significantly reduced by ferric Fe alone. We hypothesize that Fe oxides inhibited algal growth and enhanced metal accumulation, leading to a reduction in the quantity and quality of food resources for grazers. Mesocosm experiments conducted using natural benthic communities provide a unique opportunity to quantify the relative importance of indirect physical effects and to develop a better understanding of the relationship between basal food resources and consumers in natural stream ecosystems.

AB The exposure to pesticides by nontarget soil biota has long been regarded as a serious downside of modern agricultural regimes and the subject of heated debate. Of utmost relevance is the exposure to pesticide mixtures because their effects have been shown to not necessarily reflect the individual toxicity of their components, and even the simple addition of effects may lead to consequences not clearly anticipated. In the present study, a multiple biomarker approach was employed to identify the mechanistic and time effects underlying several single and mixture treatments of chlorpyrifos (CPF) and mancozeb (MCZ) in juveniles and adults of the terrestrial isopod Porcellionides pruinosus. The effects of the individual pesticides and the mixtures at recommended doses were mostly transitory under these controlled conditions and one-pulse exposure. Whereas imbalances were identified on detoxification and oxidative stress-related enzymes, the isopods generally showed the ability to recover through the end of the experiment. However, juveniles displayed greater vulnerability than adults. Most of the differences between life stages occurred in energy-related parameters where distinct performances and stress-handling behaviors were observed, suggesting higher metabolic costs to juveniles. Our results stress that understanding the time dependence of the underlying mechanisms governing the joint effects of the pesticides can help in assessing and anticipating the effects of the pesticide mixtures. Moreover, we emphasize the importance of taking life stage-related differences into consideration when evaluating the environmental risks of pesticides and pesticide mixtures. (C) 2018 SETAC.

AB Environmental contaminants are found throughout Arctic marine ecosystems, and their presence in seabirds has been associated with toxicological responses. However, there are few studies of genotoxicity in Arctic avian wildlife. The purpose of the present study was to quantify deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in lymphocytes of selected seabird species and to examine whether accumulation of organohalogen contaminants (SOHCs) affects DNA damage. Blood was sampled from common eider (Somateria mollissima), black guillemot (Cepphus grylle), black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus), arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus), and great skua (Stercorarius skua) in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard (Norway). Contaminant concentrations found in the 6 species differed, presumably because of foraging ecology and biomagnification. Despite large differences in contaminant concentrations, ranging from SOHCs 3.3 ng/g wet weight in the common eider to SOHCs 895 ng/g wet weight in the great skua, there was no strong difference among the species in baseline DNA damage or sensitivity to a genotoxic stressor (hydrogen peroxide). Baseline levels of DNA damage were low, with median values ranging from 1.7% in the common eider to 8.6% in the great skua. There were no associations between DNA damage and contaminants in the investigated species, suggesting that contaminant concentrations in Kongsfjorden are too low to evoke genotoxic effects, or possibly that lymphocytes are resistant to strand breakage. Clearly, genotoxicity is a topic for future studies of Arctic seabirds. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB The immunotoxicity of 4 commonly detected perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), namely, perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) was investigated by measuring biomarkers of the immune profile of green mussels, Perna viridis. The biomarkers included neutral red retention, phagocytosis, and spontaneous cytotoxicity, all of which were tested on mussel hemocytes. Hemocytes are an important component of the invertebrate immune system. We found that exposure to PFASs could lead to reduced hemocyte cell viability and suppress immune function by up to 50% of normal performance within the experimental exposure range. The results indicate that PFASs have an immunotoxic potential and thus could pose severe health risks to aquatic organisms. The reported immunotoxicity is likely to result from the compounds' direct and indirect interactions with the hemocyte membrane, and therefore likely to affect the functionality of these cells. The immunotoxic response was found to be related to the organism's burden of PFASs, and was reversible when the compounds were removed from the test organisms. Based on this relationship, models using an organism's PFAS concentration and bioaccumulation factor (BAF) as the independent variables were established to quantify PFAS-induced immunotoxicity. The models help us to gain a better understanding of the toxic mechanism of PFASs, and provide a tool to evaluate adverse effects for the whole group of compounds with one mathematical equation.

Bis-(3-allyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) sulfone (TGSH) represents a potential BPA alternative; however, exposure and ecotoxicological data are scarce. To determine effects on embryonic viability, development, and hepatic mRNA expression at 2 distinct developmental periods (midincubation [day 11] and pipping [days 20-21]), TGSH was injected into the air cell of unincubated, fertilized chicken embryos at 4 concentrations ranging from 0 to 180 mu g/g egg. Concentrations of TGSH increased in a dose-dependent manner in whole-embryo homogenates, and the estimated median lethal dose (LD50) based on embryonic viability at midincubation was 66 mu g/g (95% confidence interval = 31-142 mu g/g), which is similar to the BPA LD50 (similar to 67 mu g/g) reported in a previous study. Modulation of hepatic gene targets from a chicken ToxChip polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array was observed at both developmental stages. At midincubation, 21/43 genes on the PCR array were significantly altered (by >1.5-fold) in the 180 mu g/g dose group, whereas 9 and 6/43 were altered at pipping in the 9.2 and 48 mu g/g groups, respectively. Predominant toxicity pathways included xenobiotic metabolism, lipid homeostasis, bile acid synthesis, and cell cycle regulation. The estrogen-responsive gene apolipoprotein II was significantly up-regulated in liver tissue of midincubation embryos at 180 mu g/g; however, neither apolipoprotein II nor vitellogenin II were altered at the other concentrations or developmental time points. Given the importance of identifying suitable BPA replacement alternatives, the present study provides novel, whole-animal toxicological data for a BPA replacement alternative that has an effect on embryonic viability similar to that of the compound it could replace.

AB Mating pairs of medaka (Oryzias latipes) were exposed to diclofenac at measured concentrations of 0 (control), 7.1, 37, and 78g/L for 14 d under static-renewal conditions. Effects on reproductive success, as well as morphological abnormalities, of the fish were assessed. During the exposure period, both fecundity and fertility were significantly decreased in the 37- and 78-g/L treatment groups, and swollen abdomens in females were observed in all exposure groups. Notably, a defect of the lower jaw was also observed in 4 male fish: 2 at 37g/L and 2 at 78g/L of diclofenac. Subsequently, we investigated whether the reproductive and morphological abnormalities induced by diclofenac would be permanent or reversible once the medaka were returned to clean water. The reproductive ability of paired medaka was gradually restored to fish that were cultured in clean water for 14 d. After this period in clean water, we also observed a noticeable decrease in swollen abdomens in females; however, mandibular defects in the males remained, even after the 14-d recovery period. Radiographic and histochemical examinations revealed that diclofenac might affect bone remodeling in the lower jaw of male medaka because of a disruption in osteoclast function. These results suggest that reproductive impairments in pairs of medaka exposed to diclofenac may be reversible but that skeletal deformities (i.e., mandibular defect) in males may be persistent.

AB Metal pollution is a serious threat to environmental health. While the aquatic isopod Asellus aquaticus L. (Isopoda) is an important decomposer of freshwater ecosystems, very little research has reported its long-term or incipient lethal concentrations for metals. Moreover, the lethal concentrations at a certain percentage (LCxs) that can be found in the literature are often based on unmeasured concentrations, which could lead to a severe underestimation of the actual toxicity. In the present exploratory study, the 1-, 4-, 7-, and 14-d LC10, LC20, and LC50 values of copper, cadmium, and lead for adult A. aquaticus were determined. The LCx values were calculated using the nominal concentrations, the effective concentrations, and the free ion activities. Incipient lethal values were determined as well. In general, surprisingly lower lethal concentrations were found than in other studies. Furthermore, the present study shows that lethal concentrations based on free ion activities were generally much lower than nominal and effective concentrations. Although almost all LC values were higher than the environmental quality standards (EQS), the Cu 14-d LC10 and several (incipient) Pb LC10 and LC20 values, all calculated with free ion activities, were lower than the EQS. We conclude that lethal or effective concentrations based on free ion activities provide a more realistic view, which is vital for environmental policy making. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have recently received increased research attention, particularly concerning aquatic organisms and in regions of exposure to aqueous film forming foams (AFFFs). Air Force bases historically applied AFFFs in the interest of fire training exercises and have since expressed concern for PFAS contamination in biota from water bodies surrounding former fire training areas. Six PFAS were monitored, including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), in aquatic species from 8 bayou locations at Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, Louisiana (USA) over the course of 1 yr. The focus was to evaluate temporal and spatial variability in PFAS concentrations from historic use of AFFF. The PFOS concentrations in fish peaked in early summer, and also increased significantly downstream of former fire training areas. Benthic organisms had lower PFOS concentrations than pelagic species, contrary to previous literature observations. Bioconcentration factors varied with time but were reduced compared with previously reported literature values. The highest concentration of PFOS in whole fish was 9349 ng/g dry weight, with 15% of samples exceeding what is believed to be the maximum whole fish concentration reported to date of 1500 ng/g wet weight. Further studies are ongoing, to measure PFAS in larger fish and tissue-specific partitioning data to compare with the current whole fish values. The high concentrations presently observed could have effects on higher trophic level organisms in this system or pose a potential risk to humans consuming contaminated fish. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Chemicals used in the prevention of corrosion and biofouling may be released into the environment via industrial cooling water discharges. The authors assessed the impacts of 2 commonly used chemicals, morpholine and sodium hypochlorite, on development in lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis). Embryos were exposed chronically, beginning at fertilization or at the eyed stage. Acute 96-h exposures were also examined at 4 development stages. Chronic morpholine resulted in median lethal concentrations (LC50s) of 219 +/- 54 mg/L when exposure began at fertilization and 674 +/- 12 mg/L when exposure began at the eyed stage, suggesting that embryos are more sensitive earlier in development. Chronic morpholine exposure advanced hatching by up to 30%, and the early hatching embryos were up to 10% smaller in body length. A decrease in yolk conversion efficiency was also observed in embryos exposed to chronic morpholine concentrations of 1000 mg/L. The majority of effects from morpholine exposure manifested near hatch, possibly reflecting changes in chorion permeability at the end of embryonic development. Sodium hypochlorite only impacted survival with chronic exposure from fertilization, where the total residual chlorine LC50 was 0.52 +/- 0.11 mg/L. Acute exposures to both chemicals had minimal effects up to the highest tested concentrations. Overall, the results suggest that the risk during development from exposure to morpholine and sodium hypochlorite is low under normal operating conditions. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Mass transfer coefficients of the water boundary layer (k(w)) were measured using alabaster dissolution kinetics in a diffusion cell that was operated at stirring rates between 90 min(-1) and 600 min(-1), aiming to provide a more robust characterization of the effect of hydrodynamics on the uptake of polar compounds by passive samplers, as compared with characterizations in terms of stirring rates and water flow velocities. The measured k(w) helped to quantitatively understand calcium sulfate transport through a poly(ethersulfone) membrane and 2 water boundary layers (at both sides of the membrane). Alabaster-based k(w) value were used to understand atrazine transport in the diffusion cell, allowing the conclusion that atrazine transport in the membrane is via the pore space, rather than via the polymer matrix. The merits of measuring alabaster dissolution rates for passive sampler calibration and application in the field are discussed. The authors propose that passive sampler calibrations be carried out under controlled k(w) conditions, rather than under controlled stirring rates or flow velocities. This would facilitate the interpretation of passive sampler calibration studies andthe translation of laboratory-based water sampling rates to flow conditions that apply in the field. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The estrogenic potential (expressed as a score composite of 18 high throughput screening bioassays) of 1528 compounds from the ToxCast database was modeled by a 3-dimensional spectral data activity relationship approach (3D-SDAR). Due to a lack of O-17 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) simulation software, the most informative carbon-carbon 3D-SDAR fingerprints were augmented with indicator variables representing oxygen atoms from carbonyl and carboxamide, ester, sulfonyl, nitro, aliphatic hydroxyl, and phenolic hydroxyl groups. To evaluate the true predictive performance of the authors' model the United States Environmental Protection Agency provided them with a blind test set consisting of 2008 compounds. Of these, 543 had available literature data-their binding affinity served to estimate the external classification accuracy of the developed model: predictive accuracy of 0.62, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.53 were obtained. Compared with alternative modeling techniques, the authors' model displayed very little reduction in performance between the modeling and the prediction set. A 3D-SDAR mapping technique allowed identification of structural features essential for estrogenicity: 1) the presence of a phenolic OH group or cyclohexenone, 2) a second aromatic or phenolic ring at a distance of 6 angstrom to 8 angstrom from the oxygen of the first phenol ring, 3) the presence of a methyl group approximately 6 angstrom away from the centroid of a phenol ring, and 4) a carbonyl group in close proximity (similar to 4 angstrom measured to the centroid) to 1 of the phenol rings.

AB Bees are exposed in their environment to contaminants that can weaken the colony and contribute to bee declines. Monoterpenoid-based preparations can be introduced into hives to control the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. The long-term effects of monoterpenoids are poorly investigated. Olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) has been used to evaluate the impact of stressors on cognitive functions of the honeybee such as learning and memory. The authors tested the PER to odorants on bees after exposure to monoterpenoids in hives. Octopamine receptors, transient receptor potential-like (TRPL), and -aminobutyric acid channels are thought to play a critical role in the memory of food experience. Gene expression levels of Amoa1, Rdl, and trpl were evaluated in parallel in the bee brain because these genes code for the cellular targets of monoterpenoids and some pesticides and neural circuits of memory require their expression. The miticide impaired the PER to odors in the 3wk following treatment. Short-term and long-term olfactory memories were improved months after introduction of the monoterpenoids into the beehives. Chronic exposure to the miticide had significant effects on Amoa1, Rdl, and trpl gene expressions and modified seasonal changes in the expression of these genes in the brain. The decrease of expression of these genes in winter could partly explain the improvement of memory. The present study has led to new insights into alternative treatments, especially on their effects on memory and expression of selected genes involved in this cognitive function.

AB Greenwich Bay is an urbanized embayment of Narragansett Bay potentially impacted by multiple stressors. The present study identified the important stressors affecting Greenwich Bay benthic fauna. First, existing data and information were used to confirm that the waterbody was impaired. Second, the presence of source, stressor, and effect were established. Then linkages between source, stressor, and effect were developed. This allows identification of probable stressors adversely affecting the waterbody. Three pollutant categories were assessed: chemicals, nutrients, and suspended sediments. This weight of evidence approach indicated that Greenwich Bay was primarily impacted by eutrophication-related stressors. The sediments of Greenwich Bay were carbon enriched and low dissolved oxygen concentrations were commonly seen, especially in the western portions of Greenwich Bay. The benthic community was depauperate, as would be expected under oxygen stress. Although our analysis indicated that contaminant loads in Greenwich Bay were at concentrations where adverse effects might be expected, no toxicity was observed, as a result of high levels of organic carbon in these sediments reducing contaminant bioavailability. Our analysis also indicated that suspended sediment impacts were likely nonexistent for much of the Bay. This analysis demonstrates that the diagnostic procedure was useful to organize and assess the potential stressors impacting the ecological well-being of Greenwich Bay. This diagnostic procedure is useful for management of waterbodies impacted by multiple stressors. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:449-462. (c) 2016 SETAC

AB A series of toxicity tests with MON 0818, a commercial surfactant mixture of polyoxyethylene tallow amines, were performed: 1) in the presence of sediment for benthic invertebrates and fish: 2) to examine the recovery capacity of Daphnia magna and 4 primary producers after a pulsed (24-h) exposure; and 3) to examine the potential effect of increased water temperature on toxicity of MON 0818 to 2 cold-water fishes. In the presence of sediment, no acute (24-h) mortality was observed for 3 of the 5 species up to 10mgL(-1). The median effective concentrations for the other 2 species were significantly greater than for water only tests. The EC50 at 15 degrees C for Salvelinus alpinus was statistically lower than that at 10 degrees C. Latent effects of a 24-h exposure (1mgL(-1)) were observed for Rhabdocelis subcapitata and Chlorella vulgaris, as indicated by delayed growth during recovery phase; however, both cultures were able to recover, as indicated by a lack of changes in maximum absolute growth rates. No significant effects of a 24-h exposure to MON 0818 were observed for Oophila sp. (1.5mgL(-1)) or Lemna minor (100mgL(-1)). Latent mortality after a 24-h exposure to 5mgL(-1) was observed during the recovery phase for D. magna; however, reproduction endpoints on surviving individuals were not altered. The results indicate that quick dissipation of MON 0818 in the presence of sediment can reduce the effects on exposed organisms, and that full recovery from 24-h exposures to concentrations of MON 0818 equal to, or greater than, those expected in the environment is possible.

AB Mining of sulfide-rich pyritic ores produces acid mine drainage waters and has induced major ecological problems in aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Biomining utilizes microbes to extract metals from the ore, and it has been suggested as a new sustainable way to produce metals. However, little is known of the potential ecotoxicological effects of biomining. In the present study, biomining impacts were assessed using survival and behavioral responses of aquatic macroinvertebrates at in situ exposures in streams. The authors used an impedance conversion technique to measure quantitatively in situ behavioral responses of larvae of the regionally common mayfly, Heptagenia dalecarlica, to discharges from the Talvivaara mine (Sotkamo, Northern Finland), which uses a biomining technique. Behavioral responses measured in 3 mine-impacted streams were compared with those measured in 3 reference streams. In addition, 3-d survival of the mayfly larvae and the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus was measured in the study sites. Biomining impacts on stream water quality included increased concentrations of sulfur, sulfate, and metals, especially manganese, cadmium, zinc, sodium, and calcium. Survival of the invertebrates in the short term was not affected by the mine effluents. In contrast, apparent behavioral changes in mayfly larvae were detected, but these responses were not consistent among sites, which may reflect differing natural water chemistry of the study sites.

AB Selenium (Se) toxicity to fish is primarily manifested via maternal transfer to the eggs, which may result in adverse effects on larval survival and development. The present study assessed the effects of egg Se concentrations derived via maternal transfer on early life-stage development, survival, and growth of Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus), a salmonid species not previously assessed for Se sensitivity. Fish gametes were collected from 4 streams in Alaska known to exhibit a range of egg Se concentrations. Eggs were fertilized and reared in the laboratory from hatch through post-swim-up. Larvae were assessed for survival, length, and weight, as well as deformities (skeletal, craniofacial, fin-fold) and edema based on a graduated severity index. Eggs from a total of 47 females were collected, with egg Se concentrations ranging from 3.3 to 33.9 mg kg(-1) dry weight. No relationships were observed between larval endpoints evaluated and parent females' egg, muscle, or whole-body Se concentrations. Therefore, Se 10% effective concentrations (EC10s) were defined as the maximum measured Se concentrations: >33.9, >17.6, and >19.7 mg kg(-1) dry weight for eggs, muscle, and whole-body tissue, respectively. Collectively, these data indicate that Arctic grayling are relatively insensitive to maternally transferred Se compared to other fish species. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-10. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Honey bees and other wild bee species including bumble bees have experienced population declines in recent decades. Although many stressors are implicated in bee population declines, much attention has focused on neonicotinoid pesticides, which are widely used and known to be toxic to pollinators. One neonicotinoid, acetamiprid, has been studied very little in bumble bees, despite its use on bumble bee-pollinated crops. We assessed the impacts of acetamiprid to the North American bumble bee Bombus impatiens using the microcolony model. We examined nest growth, development, and subsequent nest productivity as measured by drone production. We found that high concentrations of acetamiprid in pollen (4520 mu g/kg) significantly impacted nest growth, development, and, ultimately, reproduction (drone production). We found the no-observable-adverse effect level to be 45.2 mu g/kg. Overall, acetamiprid has the potential to negatively impact reproductive endpoints for B. impatiens. However, effects occurred at concentrations substantially higher than expected environmental concentrations that would be achieved when following label rates. Further work is required to assess the effects of this pesticide on B. impatiens via alternate routes of exposure and on queenright colonies. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-10. (c) 2020 SETAC.

AB The dispersion of clothianidin from treated seeds was studied in a commercial winter canola field. During planting, using a John Deere 1890 single disk air seeder, a proportion, an estimated 14.2 +/- 2.9% (mean +/- standard error), of the clothianidin that was applied to the seed escaped into the atmosphere from the seeder's exhaust. We suggest that this source of environmental contamination may be the main contributor that explains the off-target detection of neonicotinoid residues in soils and water near canola plantings better than movement from seed after it is placed in the soil, which is often proposed in the literature.

We exposed larvae of 3 butterfly species (Pieris rapae,Colias philodice, andDanaus plexippus) to low levels of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid in their host plants and followed individuals to adulthood. Imidacloprid altered adult body size, especially in female monarchs, but its effects varied across maternal families, highlighting the importance of considering genetic variation in ecotoxicological testing.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-9.

AB Bioaccumulation assessment predominantly relies on the bioconcentration factor (BCF) as the sole decisive metric. The test guideline 305 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) provides the standard procedure for deriving this in vivo fish BCF, which is not only expensive and labor-intensive, but also requires many animals. Accordingly, there is a great need for and interest in alternative methods that can help to reduce, replace, and refine vertebrate tests, as described in the 3R principles. Two alternative approaches have been developed: the bioconcentration test with the freshwater amphipodHyalella aztecaand the OECD test guideline 319 which provides a method to determine experimentally derived in vitro metabolism rates that can then be incorporated into in silico prediction models for rainbow trout BCF calculation. In the present study both alternative methods were applied to 5 substances of different physicochemical characteristics. The results were compared with literature values of fish in vivo BCFs and additional BCFs obtained with the alternative methods, if available. Potential differences between the results of the test methods are discussed utilizing information such as in vivo metabolism rates. The currently available data set suggests that these 2 alternative methods pose promising alternatives to predict bioaccumulation in fish, although defined applicability domains have yet to be determined.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-13.

AB Yolk is the most important temporary biological compartment of the early life stages of fish embryos. The sorption strength of a chemical to yolk components may significantly influence the distribution of that chemical in the fish embryo. We determined yolk-water partition coefficients (K-yolk/water, in liters of water per kilogram of yolk, normalized to dry wt) for 70 neutral organic chemicals. The log K(yolk/water)values range from 0.76 to 6.56. On the basis of these values, we developed polyparameter linear free energy relationship models to predict yolk-water partitioning for a broad range of neutral organic chemicals with a root mean squared error of 0.37 andr(2)of 0.919. These models can be applied for the prediction of internal concentrations at equilibrium (neglecting biotransformation and active transport) in the zebrafish embryo test system.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-11.

AB We used domestic chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) as a model for granivorous birds to identify methods to detect recent imidacloprid exposure in wild birds. We conducted dosing experiments of 1, 5, 10, and 20% of a reported median lethal dose for domestic chickens using repeated daily exposures over 7 d, at dosages equating to 1.04, 5.2, 10.4, and 20.8 mg/kg/d. We examined the parent compound and metabolites in serial collections of feces and blood during exposures and for 15 d after exposures. We also collected liver, kidney, brain, muscle, and spleen at the experiment end. Mean concentrations of parent compound at 15 d postexposure were highest in the feces and brain, followed by the liver, muscle, spleen, and kidney; but mean concentrations of metabolites 5-OH-imidacloprid and imidacloprid-olefin were highest in feces; then liver, spleen, muscle, and kidney; and then brain. Imidacloprid was rapidly cleared from blood, with only one individual in any dose group having detectable concentrations after 48 h. In contrast, fecal pellets had the highest frequency of imidacloprid detection after 15 d. Concentrations of metabolites were higher than those of the parent compound at all sampling times examined but provided no information about time since exposure. Feces may provide a reliable nonlethal method for detection of recent imidacloprid exposure in wild birds. Additional work is needed to disentangle exposure dose concentration and time since exposure in field-collected samples. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-12. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Waterfowl are often exposed to and readily accumulate anthropogenic contaminants when foraging in polluted environments. Settling impoundments containing coal combustion waste (CCW) enriched in trace elements such as arsenic (As), selenium (Se), and mercury (Hg) are often used by free-ranging migratory and resident waterfowl and represent potential sources for contaminant uptake. To assess accumulation of CCW contaminants, we experimentally restricted waterfowl to a CCW-contaminated impoundment and quantified trace element burdens in blood, muscle, and liver tissues over known periods of exposure (between 3 and 92 d). From these data we developed models 1) to predict elemental bioaccumulation with increased exposure time, and 2) to predict muscle/liver burdens based on concentrations in blood as a nondestructive sampling method. Although Hg and As did not bioaccumulate in our waterfowl, we observed an increase in Se concentrations in muscle, liver, and blood tissues over the duration of our experiment. Furthermore, we found that blood may be used as an effective nondestructive sampling alternative to predict muscle and liver tissue concentrations in birds contaminated with Se and As through dietary exposure. These data provide unique insights into accumulation rates of contaminants for waterfowl utilizing habitats contaminated with CCW and demonstrate the efficacy of nonlethal sampling of waterfowl to quantify contaminant exposure.

AB Down-the-drain exposure models provide a valuable tool for estimating environmental exposure to substances which are treated and discharged by municipal wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs). Microplastics may enter WWTPs from consumer activities and disposal. An exposure framework was developed using the iSTREEM (R) model, which estimates spatially explicit concentrations of substances in riverine systems across the United States and portions of Ontario, Canada. One hundred simulations covering a range of WWTP removal and instream loss rates (proxy for net sedimentation) were incorporated into a Web-based visualization tool for user exploration of relative concentrations across simulations. Surface water concentrations specific to user-supplied tonnage were examined via interactive heat maps and cumulative distributions. Exploring the spatial aspect of iSTREEM results showed that modeling 90% WWTP removal and no instream loss resulted in 8.5% of the mass entering WWTPs discharged to marine estuaries (7.4%) or Great Lakes (1.1%) environments, with the remainder of the mass discharged (1.5%) in inland sinks or exiting the United States via rivers. Modeling an example instream loss of k = 0.1 d(-1) (i.e., half-life = 7 d), terminal river segments contained 3.3% of influent mass (2.3% marine estuaries, 1.0% Great Lakes). Varying instream loss rates had substantial impacts on the total mass exported. The Web-based tool provided a user-based mechanism to visualize relative freshwater concentrations of microplastics across a large geographic area by varying simplified particle fate assumptions.

AB Because of its hydrophobicity and persistence, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is ubiquitous in sediments and poses significant risk to benthic organisms. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the long-term toxicity of DDT. However, limited information is available on its chronic toxicity to benthic invertebrates. Full-life cycle toxicity of sediment-bound DDT to Chironomus dilutus was assessed. Median lethal concentrations (with 95% confidence limits) of DDT and its degradation products (DDX) to C. dilutus were 334 (165-568), 21.4 (11.2-34.3), and 7.50 (4.61-10.6) nmol/g organic carbon after 10-, 20-, and 63-d exposure, respectively. In addition, median effect concentrations of DDX were 20.0 (15.0-25.3), 7.13 (4.10-10.5), and 8.92 (3.32-15.1) nmol/g organic carbon for growth, emergence, and reproduction, respectively. A toxicity spectrum was established to visually summarize chronic effects of DDX to midges. In addition, DDT degraded to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) during sediment aging, and their toxicity differed from that of the parent compound. Predicted toxic units of DDX in porewater were utilized to distinguish between toxicity from DDT and that of DDD and DDE. The results showed that DDD was the main contributor to the toxicity in C. dilutus. To improve the accuracy of sediment risk assessment of DDT, the composition of DDX should be considered.

AB Survival rate, frequency of malformed embryos, and antioxidant defense system responses in the benthic amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus from the Baltic Sea were measured to examine the effects of toxic sediments, and to assess the usefulness of these endpoints in sediment toxicity biotesting. A highly contaminated sediment sample from the Baltic Sea was diluted with sediment from a clean site to come up with a series of 5 test sediments with dilutions from 1:32 to 1:1024, and the reference sediment. The 1:32 dilution of the test sediment was analyzed for organotins (2862 mu g tin [Sn] kg dry wt (-1)), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (6064 mu g kg dry wt (-1)), and selected trace metals (e.g., copper 352 mg kg dry wt (-1)). The survival rate of G. fasciatus (10-d toxicity test) was 100% in the reference and 1:1024 treatments, and began to decline from the 1:256 dilution onward. In a 28-d experiment, various types of morphological malformations were observed in 11 to 80% of the amphipod embryos in the 1:64, 1:128, and 1:256 dilutions, with only <5% in the reference treatment. Also, elevated activities in the antioxidant defense system enzymes glutathione S-transferase and catalase were observed in amphipods exposed to the contaminated sediments compared with the reference treatment, with responses at lower contamination levels compared with the appearance of malformations in the embryos. The results obtained illustrate the effectiveness of the combined application of embryonic malformations and antioxidant defense system biomarkers in amphipods in the assessment of sediment toxicity, and potentially also of sublethal effects of chemical contamination in aquatic ecosystems.

AB A multigenerational test with Chironomus riparius was performed to assess long-term effects on life-traits of exposure to selected perfluoroalkyl compounds: perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS). These persistent contaminants are widespread in aquatic ecosystems at low concentrations, possibly exerting long-term toxicity. Larvae of C. riparius of a native population were exposed for 10 generations to 10 mu g/L nominal concentrations of PFOS, PFOA, and PFBS, comparable with the maximum values found in European rivers. All treatments showed reduced growth at most/several generations. No effects on survival, development, and reproduction were found. A final tolerance-induction test was performed exposing the pre-exposed experimental cohorts to 100 mu g/L PFOS and 150 mu g/L PFOA for a whole life cycle. Factorial analysis of variance revealed no difference between treatments (i.e., PFOS vs PFOA), indicating no induced tolerance. Instead, organisms pre-exposed to PFBS were the most stressed, followed by those pre-exposed to PFOA and PFOS, with earlier emergence and reduced adult weight. The results may be related to general stress and genetic erosion induced by long-term laboratory culture, but also to long-term toxicant exposure. However, no effects at the population level (population growth rate) were proved, and thus a toxicity risk in real ecosystems at the tested concentrations seems unlikely.

AB Metformin is currently thought to be the highest drug by weight released into the aquatic environment, as a direct result of its widespread use in the treatment of a number of human health disorders. The removal of metformin from wastewaters is directly related to the formation of guanylurea (metformin's only known persistent degradation product), which is generally present at higher concentrations in surface waters than the parent compound. With metformin use rising steadily, it is important to characterize the effects of guanylurea on nontarget aquatic organisms. We recently demonstrated the effects of developmental exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of metformin on the growth of early life stage (ELS) medaka as well as effects on the body weight of adult male fish following full-life cycle exposures. In the present study, we describe similar effects of guanylurea exposure on these endpoints and life stages. Guanylurea led to effects on growth in a 28-d ELS assessment that were similar to those of metformin; however, these effects occurred at concentrations in the ng/L range compared with the mu g/L range for metformin. A possible sex-dependent association with body weight changes was also observed in adults following a 165-d full-life cycle exposure to guanylurea alone or in a mixture with metformin. To our knowledge, the present is the first study to report the toxicity of guanylurea to nontarget aquatic organisms. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-6. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB A database of 1480 chemicals with 47 associated modes of action compiled from the literature encompasses a wide range of chemical classes (alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, and polar compounds) and includes toxicity data for 79 different aquatic genera. The data were split into a calibration group and a validation group (80/20) to apply k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) methodology to predict the toxic mode of action for the compound. Other approaches were tested (support vector machines and linear discriminant analysis) as well as variations in the k-NN technique (distance weighting, feature weighting). Best-prediction results were found with k = 3, in a voting platform with optimized feature weighting. Using the predicted mode of action, the appropriate polyparameter target site model for that mode of action is applied to calculate the 50% lethal concentration (LC50). Predicted LC50s for the validation database resulted in a root-mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.752. This can be compared to an RMSE of 0.655 for the same validation set using the reference mode of action labels. The complete database resulted in an RMSE of 0.793 for reference mode of action labels. This confirms that the classification model has sufficient accuracy for predicting the mode of action and for determining toxicity using the target site model. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:375-386.

AB The chronic toxicity of ammonia to tropical freshwater species is understudied, and thus data on temperate species have been used to derive water quality guideline values for tropical regions. Such practices may lead to underprotective guideline values due to differences in toxicities observed between tropical and temperate species. In addition, the presence of ammonia in low-ionic-strength waters may also result in higher toxicity, and studies on this factor are limited. The present study assessed the toxicity of ammonia to 6 tropical freshwater species in low-ionic-strength waters. Because ammonia toxicity varies depending on the pH and temperature, test water pH concentrations were maintained at approximately pH 6.0 +/- 0.3 at temperatures between 27.5 and 30 degrees C. Low-effect chronic inhibition concentrations were derived for the following species: Chlorella sp. 66 mg L-1; Lemna aequinoctialis 22 mg L-1; Hydra viridissima 1.8 mg L-1; Moinodaphnia macleayi 27 mg L-1; Amerianna cumingi 17 mg L-1; and Mogurnda mogurnda 5.4 mg L-1 total ammonia nitrogen. Two of the species tested (a cnidarian and a fish species) were among the most sensitive reported anywhere within their taxonomic group. Chronic ammonia datasets representing toxicity estimates for temperate and tropical species were plotted and compared using species sensitivity distributions. The results indicate that the differences in chronic toxicity observed between tropical and temperate species were likely due to the low ionic strength of the waters to which tropical species were exposed, rather than any inherent physiological differences between species from tropical and temperate regions. This finding suggests that tropical waters of low ionic strength may be at a higher risk from ammonia compared with other freshwater ecosystems. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:177-189.

AB Larvae of the insect Chironomus (Chironomidae: Diptera) have great potential for estimating the bioavailability of sedimentary trace elements because they are common in fine sediments and tolerate high concentrations of these contaminants. Their use as biomonitors is limited by the fact that they are difficult to identify as to species, and the species can differ in their trace element concentrations. To determine whether pooling species would compromise their use as trace element biomonitors, we identified species of Chironomus larvae collected from 22 lakes and measured their concentrations of 9 trace elements. We found that the concentrations of arsenic, barium, cobalt, copper, manganese, and nickel did not generally differ between sympatric Chironomus species, which indicates that they could be pooled for analyses of these trace elements. In contrast, we found that cadmium (Cd), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) concentrations differed between species living at the same site according to their feeding behavior, that is, Chironomus species feeding on oxic sediments tended to have higher Cd and Zn concentrations, whereas those feeding on deeper anoxic sediments had higher Se concentrations. Because Se and Zn concentrations in sympatric Chironomus species usually differed by only a factor of 2, separating species based on their feeding behavior might not be as crucial as for Cd if larval Se and Zn concentrations vary greatly from site to site.

AB Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) are ubiquitous in household and medical products because of their antimicrobial activity. A consequence of the high volume of Ag-NP production and usage is increased amounts of Ag-NPs released into the environment. Their small size (1-100 nm) results in unique physiochemical properties that may increase toxicity relative to their bulk counterpart. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the potential toxicity of environmentally relevant concentrations of Ag-NPs in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Wild-type tropical 5D zebrafish embryos were exposed to Ag-NPs from 4 to 120 h postfertilization at 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 ppm (mg/L). Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry confirmed concentration-dependent uptake of Ag into zebrafish as well as bioaccumulation over time. A morphological assessment revealed no significant hatching impairment, morphological abnormalities, or mortality at any concentration or time point examined. However, assessment of photomotor behavior at 3 d postfertilization (dpf) revealed significant hyperactivity in the 0.3, 1, and 3 ppm Ag-NP treatment groups. At 4 dpf, significant hyperactivity was observed only in the 3 ppm treatment group, whereas 5 dpf larvae exposed to Ag-NPs displayed no significant abnormalities in photomotor behavior. These findings suggest that nonteratogenic concentrations of Ag-NPs are capable of causing transient behavioral changes during development. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:3018-3024. (c) 2018 SETAC

Ecotoxicological tests were used to evaluate the acute and chronic toxicity in earthworms (Eisenia andrei), collembolans (Folsomia candida), and 2 plant species (Brassica rapa and Triticum aestivum). Chemical analytical measurements were in good agreement with the nominal concentrations used, although some variability was seen. The results obtained showed no effects of nicarbazin at the highest nominal tested concentration of 1000 mg a.i./kg soil dry weight on any of the organisms, whereas exposure to monensin caused a concentration-specific response pattern. Species sensitivity to monensin decreased in the following rank order: B. rapa > T. aestivum > E. andrei > F. candida, with measured median effect concentrations (based on soil exposure) ranging between approximately 10 and 120 mg/kg. Our results emphasize the importance of using a test battery when assessing ecotoxicological effects by using different ecophysiological endpoints and species from different trophic levels.

AB Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been banned or voluntarily withdrawn from commerce worldwide. Declining levels of PBDEs in humans have been reported elsewhere, but not in Korea. We monitored 7 individual PBDE congeners (BDE-28, BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, BDE-154, and BDE-183) in 103 human serum samples collected in 2006. The arithmetic mean and median values for the sum of the 7 PBDEs (Sigma PBDEs) were 7.13 and 6.70ng/g lipid, respectively. In addition, 6 pooled human serum samples collected in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2013 were analyzed. A decrease in PBDE levels was observed, as reflected by the median value of Sigma PBDEs from 5.98 in 2006 to 2.98ng/g lipid in 2013 as well as in the pooled samples. The levels of individual congeners also decreased but at different declining rates. Based on these results and previously reported data, a definite decline in PBDE levels in the Korean metropolitan population could be observed from 2001 to 2013, providing the first evidence in Korea of the same decline observed elsewhere in the world.

AB Millions of barrels of oil were released into the Gulf of Mexico following the 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic components of crude oil, which may become more toxic in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a phenomenon known as photo-induced toxicity. The Deepwater Horizon spill impacted offshore and estuarine sites, where biota may be co-exposed to UV and PAHs. Penetration of UV into the water column is affected by site-specific factors. Therefore, measurements and/or estimations of UV are necessary when one is assessing the risk to biota posed by photo-induced toxicity. We describe how estimates of incident UV were determined for the area impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, using monitoring data from radiometers near the spill, in conjunction with reference spectra characterizing the composition of solar radiation. Furthermore, we provide UV attenuation coefficients for both near- and offshore sites in the Gulf of Mexico. These estimates are specific to the time and location of the spill, and fall within the range of intensities utilized during photo-induced toxicity tests performed in support of the Deepwater Horizon Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA). These data further validate the methodologies and findings of phototoxicity tests included in the Deepwater Horizon NRDA, while underscoring the importance of considering UV exposure when assessing possible risks following oil spills.

AB The effects of parental exposure to pharmaceuticals on sexual differentiation in F1 offspring were examined in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Adult zebrafish were exposed to 0 or 10g/L of carbamazepine or gemfibrozil for 6 wk and bred in pairwise crosses to generate 7 distinct lineages. Lineages were formed with both parents from the same treatment group or with only one parent exposed, to delineate between maternal and paternal effects. The F1 offspring from each lineage were reared in clean water and sampled at 45 and 60 d post fertilization (dpf). Gonadal differentiation was assessed by histology. The morphological stages of the gonads were converted to a quantitative day-equivalent based on data from offspring of untreated parents sampled from 15 to 75 dpf, which enabled a quantitative statistical analysis on the timing of sexual differentiation. Paternal, but not maternal, exposure to carbamazepine resulted in significantly faster sexual differentiation and a male-biased sex ratio; these effects were not observed when both parents were exposed. Combined paternal and maternal exposure to gemfibrozil resulted in significantly faster sexual differentiation, and paternal, but not maternal, exposure to gemfibrozil led to male-biased sex ratios. The present study demonstrates the ability of parental exposure to pharmaceuticals to disrupt sexual differentiation in the F1 offspring and also shows that effects may be uniquely influenced by which parent was exposed.

AB The synthesis of carbon-based nanomaterials is often inefficient, generating large amounts of soot with metals as waste by-product. Currently, there are no specific regulations for disposal of engineered nanomaterials or the waste by-products resulting from their synthesis, so it is presumed that by-products are disposed of in the same way as the parent (bulk) materials. We studied the terrestrial toxicity of soot from gadolinium metallofullerene nanomanufacturing on earthworms (Eisenia fetida) and isopods (Porcellio scaber). The metallofullerene soot consisted of carbon particle agglomerates in the nanometer and submicrometer ranges (1-100 and 101-999nm, respectively), with metals used during nanomanufacturing detectable on the particles. Despite high metal concentrations (>100000mg/kg) in the soot, only a relatively small amount of metals leached out of a spiked field soil, suggesting only moderate mobility. Seven- and 14-d exposures in field soil demonstrated that the soot was only toxic to earthworms at high concentrations (>10000mg/kg); however, earthworms avoided spiked soils at lower concentrations (as low as 500mg/kg) and at lower soil pH. The presence of soot in food and soil did not cause isopod avoidance. These data demonstrate that metallofullerene soot from nanomanufacturing may only be toxic to earthworms at high concentrations representative of improper disposal or accidental spills. However, our results indicate that terrestrial invertebrates may avoid soils contaminated with soot at sublethal concentrations. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:1594-1605.

AB Offspring of wild adult brown trout exposed to a range of Se concentrations were reared in a laboratory setting to primarily assess effects on survival and deformities. Maternal whole-body Se concentrations ranged from 4.7 to 22.6 mg/kg dry weight for wild fish. Corresponding Se concentrations in embryos ranged from 6.2 to 40.3 mg/kg dry weight. Significant relationships were found between embryo and whole-body tissue concentrations. Increasing egg Se concentrations were correlated with decreasing survival; however, hatch success was not significantly correlated with increasing embryo Se. The best fit effect concentration, 10% (EC10) for survival in the hatch to swim-up period was 20.6 mg/kg dry weight, and the EC10 for hatch to test termination at 88 d was 20.5 mg/kg dry weight egg Se. The best fit model for deformities was based on a baseline-adjusted severity index and resulted in an EC10 of 21.8 mg/kg dry weight egg Se. Both the best fit model EC10s represent more sensitive values than the published range of trout species EC10s. An egg to whole-body tissue conversion factor derived from the paired data resulted in a conversion factor for brown trout of 1.46, which resulted in a whole-body tissue EC10 of 14.04 mg/kg dry weight at an egg tissue EC10 of 20.5 mg/kg dry weight.

AB The present study examined the effects of chronic cadmium (Cd) exposure on metamorphosis, body size, thyroid gland, and skeletal development of Chinese toad (Bufo gargarizans) tadpoles. Tadpoles were exposed to Cd concentrations at 0, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 mu g/L from Gosner stages 26 to 46 of completion of metamorphosis. Our results showed that 100 and 500 mg/L of Cd concentrations increased mortality and decelerated metamorphosis rate. In addition, significant body size reduction at Gosner stage 42 was observed at 100 and 500 mu g/L of Cd treatments (p < 0.01). Average body length and hind-limb length were significantly decreased in the 500 mu g/L of Cd group (p < 0.05) but body mass was not significantly different at Gosner stage 46. Moreover, bone formation was delayed in high Cd concentration treatments (50, 100, and 500 mg/L) at both Gosner stage 42 and 46. Histopathological changes of the thyroid gland showed that follicular cell hyperplasia and malformation were induced by high Cd concentrations (50, 100, and 500 mu g/L). Furthermore, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that the larvae exposed to high-dose Cd exhibited a significant decrease in deiodinase (Dio2) and thyroid hormone receptor (TR beta) mRNA levels at Gosner stage 42 and 46. Our investigation indicated that high-dose Cd caused metamorphic deceleration, body size reduction, and delayed skeletal development through disrupting the thyroid system in B. gargarizans larvae.

TI COMBINED ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENT FOR THE ANTIVIRAL PHARMACEUTICALS

   Environmental risk assessment
AB Potential environmental risks of the old antiviral pharmaceuticals ganciclovir (GCV) and valganciclovir (VGCV) were reassessed based on new environmental fate and chronic ecotoxicity tests and on actual use data for Europe. Valganciclovir is hydrolyzed to GCV by intestinal and hepatic esterases, and hence the new environmental tests only refer to GCV. A sorption study showed that GCV will not sorb significantly, excluding the soil as a relevant environmental compartment. Despite earlier data suggesting nondegradability, a new water/sediment fate test showed GCV to be primarily and ultimately degraded and to be nonpersistent. The chronic ecotoxicity tests with algae and daphnids resulted in no inhibition at the highest tested concentrations, whereas a fish partial life cycle test, selected in view of mammalian mutagenicity and reprotoxicity data, showed effects on growth of the young fish, but not on gametogenesis, fertilization, embryogenesis, or teratogenicity. Predicted environmental concentrations were derived based on actual per capita use data for European countries for 2004 to 2014, and the highest was selected for the risk assessment. A comparison of predicted environmental concentrations with predicted no-effect concentrations shows no significant risk for wastewater treatment, surface waters, groundwater, or sediment. In addition, potential risks to (semi) aquatic top predators or to human consumers of water and fish are exceedingly low. (C) 2017 The Author.

AB The present study applies a chemical activity-based approach to: 1) evaluate environmental concentrations of di-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP; n = 23 651) and its metabolite mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP; n = 1232) in 16 environmental media from 1174 studies in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and in vivo toxicity data from 934 studies in 20 species, as well as in vitro biological activity data from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Toxicity Forecaster and other sources; and 2) conduct a comprehensive environmental risk analysis. The results show that the mean chemical activities of DEHP and MEHP in abiotic environmental samples from locations around the globe are 0.001 and 10(-8), respectively. This indicates that DEHP has reached on average 0.1% of saturation in the abiotic environment. The mean chemical activity of DEHP in biological samples is on average 100-fold lower than that in abiotic samples, likely because of biotransformation of DEHP in biota. Biological responses in both in vivo and in vitro tests occur at chemical activities between 0.01 to 1 for DEHP and between approximately 10(-6) and 10(-2) for MEHP, suggesting a greater potency of MEHP compared with DEHP. Chemical activities of both DEHP and MEHP in biota samples were less than those causing biological responses in the in vitro bioassays, without exception. A small fraction of chemical activities of DEHP in abiotic environmental samples (i.e., 4-8%) and none (0%) for MEHP were within the range of chemical activities associated with observed toxicological responses in the in vivo tests. The present study illustrates the chemical activity approach for conducting risk analyses. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The lack of knowledge on the fate of explosive compounds 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5triazine (RDX), particularly in marine ecosystems, constrains the application of bioremediation techniques in explosive-contaminated coastal sites. The authors present a comparative study on anaerobic biodegradation and mineralization of N-15-nitro group isotopically labeled TNT and RDX in organic carbon-rich, fine-grained marine sediment with native microbial assemblages. Separate sediment slurry experiments were carried out for TNT and RDX at 23 degrees C for 16 d. Dissolved and sediment-sorbed fractions of parent and transformation products, isotopic compositions of sediment, and mineralization products of the dissolved inorganic N pool ((NH4+)-N-15, (NO3-)-N-15, (NO2-)-N-15, and N-15(2)) were measured. The rate of TNT removal from the aqueous phase was faster (0.75 h(-1)) than that of RDX (0.37 h(-1)), and N-15 accumulation in sediment was higher in the TNT (13%) than the RDX (2%) microcosms. Mono-aminodinitrotoluenes were identified as intermediate biodegradation products of TNT. Two percent of the total spiked TNT-N is mineralized to dissolved inorganic N through 2 different pathways: denitration as well as deamination and formation of NH4+, facilitated by iron and sulfate reducing bacteria in the sediments. The majority of the spiked TNT-N (85%) is in unidentified pools by day 16. Hexahydro-1,3,5trinitro- 1,3,5-triazine (10%) biodegrades to nitroso derivatives, whereas 13% of RDX-N in nitro groups is mineralized to dissolved inorganic N anaerobically by the end of the experiment. The primary identified mineralization end product of RDX (40%) is NH4+, generated through either deamination or mono-denitration, followed by ring breakdown. A reasonable production of N-2 gas (13%) was seen in the RDX system but not in the TNT system. Sixty-eight percent of the total spiked RDX-N is in an unidentified pool by day 16 and may include unquantified mineralization products dissolved in water. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) embryos and larvae were exposed to 6 different manganese sulfate (MnSO4) concentrations from fertilization to the 3-d-old larvae. The fertilization success, offspring survival, larval growth, yolk consumption, embryonic and larval Mn tissue concentrations, and transcript levels of detoxification-related genes were measured in the long-term incubation. A full factorial breeding design (4 females x 2 males) allowed examination of the significance of both female and male effects, as well as female-male interactions in conjunction with the MnSO4 exposure in terms of the observed endpoints. The MnSO4 exposure reduced the survival of the whitefish early life stages. The offspring MnSO4 tolerance also was affected by the female parent, and the female-specific mean lethal concentrations (LC50s) varied from 42.0 mg MnSO4/L to 84.6 mg MnSO4/L. The larval yolk consumption seemed slightly inhibited at the exposure concentration of 41.8 mg MnSO4/L. The MnSO4 exposure caused a significant induction of metallothionein-A (mt-a) and metallothionein-B (mt-b) in the 3-d-old larvae, and at the exposure concentration of 41.8 mg MnSO4/L the mean larval mt-a and mt-b expressions were 47.5% and 56.6% higher, respectively, than at the control treatment. These results illustrate that whitefish reproduction can be impaired in waterbodies that receive Mn and SO4 in concentrations substantially above the typical levels in boreal freshwaters, but the offspring tolerance can be significantly affected by the parents and in particular the female parent.

AB The present study aimed to quantitate 15 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in 125 adult American alligators at 12 sites across the southeastern United States. Of those 15 PFAAs, 9 were detected in 65% to 100% of samples: perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA), perfluorododecanoic acid, perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTriA), perfluorotetradecanoic acid, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Males (across all sites) showed significantly higher concentrations of 4 PFAAs: PFOS (p-0.01), PFDA (p-0.0003), PFUnA (p-0.021), and PFTriA (p-0.021). Concentrations of PFOS, PFHxS, and PFDA in plasma were significantly different among the sites in each sex. Alligators at both Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge (FL, USA) and Kiawah Nature Conservancy (SC, USA) exhibited some of the highest PFOS concentrations (medians of 99.5 ng/g and 55.8 ng/g, respectively) in plasma measured to date in a crocodilian species. A number of positive correlations between PFAAs and snout-vent length were observed in both sexes, suggesting that PFAA body burdens increase with increasing size. In addition, several significant correlations among PFAAs in alligator plasma may suggest conserved sources of PFAAs at each site throughout the greater study area. The present study is the first to report PFAAs in American alligators, to reveal potential PFAA hot spots in Florida and South Carolina, and to provide a contaminant of concern when assessing anthropogenic impacts on ecosystem health.

ID CONTAMINATION; RISK; FRAMEWORK; TOXICITY
AB Current admission policies for pesticides follow a controlled experimental tiered risk assessment approach, giving results that are difficult to extrapolate to a real-world situation. Later analyses of compounds such as DDT and neonicotinoid pesticides clearly show that the actual chemical impacts frequently affect many more components of an ecosystem than a priori suggested by risk assessment. Therefore, to manage the actual risks for ecosystems imposed by manufactured compounds, it is proposed that current admission policies for chemicals be enriched by using postregistration monitoring. Such monitoring is essential to identify unexpected direct and indirect impacts on organisms by accounting for multiple propagation routes and exposures. Implementation of postregistration monitoring could build on existing monitoring networks. This approach would tackle the current policy impasse of compartment-based regulations versus exposure-based regulations, and, more importantly, would provide a safety lock for risk assessment across compartments and more likely ensure the protection of our natural environment.

AB Research on neonicotinoids and honeybees have changed focus from direct mortality to sublethal effects. In the present study, a published honeybee model, BEEHAVE, is used to compare induced colony level impact of pesticides including direct mortality, poor brood care, disorientation, and increased handling time in oilseed rape and sunflower crops. Actual effects on individual bees will depend on exposure concentrations, but in the present study large effects were enforced. In oilseed rape, poor brood care had the largest colony impact, because it created a bottleneck for spring build-up of the workforce, and colony impact for all effect types peaked 1 mo after exposure ceased. In sunflower, the later exposure changed the response so colony impact peaked during exposure, and the bottleneck was honey store build-up. In all scenarios, good forage mitigated effects substantially. It is concluded that field studies should continue at least 1 mo after exposure to ensure detection of ecologically relevant sublethal effects. The results indicated that even if a sublethal effect is difficult to detect in the field, subsequent ecologically relevant colony level impacts would be clear if studies are continued for 1 mo after exposure. Guidance for regulatory studies recommends extended observation periods, and published field studies already use extended observation periods, so it is concluded that current methods are adequate for detecting ecologically relevant sublethal effects. Although published laboratory and semifield studies conducted under controlled exposure conditions suggest that sublethal effects may occur, published field studies with neonicotinoid seed treatments, naturally foraging bees, and extended observation periods do not report colony-level effects, suggesting that in these studies no ecologically relevant sublethal effects occurred.

AB Bats play a vital role in our ecosystems and economies as natural pest-control agents, seed dispersers, and pollinators. Agricultural intensification, however, can impact bats foraging near crops, affecting the ecosystem services they provide. Exposure to pesticides, for example, may induce chromosome breakage or missegregation that can result in micronucleus formation. Detection of micronuclei is a simple, inexpensive, and relatively minimally invasive technique commonly used to evaluate chemical genotoxicity but rarely applied to assess wildlife genotoxic effects. We evaluated the suitability of the micronucleus test as a biomarker of genotoxicity for biomonitoring field studies in bats. We collected blood samples from insectivorous bats roosting in caves surrounded by different levels of disturbance (agriculture, human settlements) in Colima and Jalisco, west central Mexico. Then, we examined the frequency of micronucleus inclusions in erythrocytes using differentially stained blood smears. Bats from caves surrounded by proportionately more (53%) land used for agriculture and irrigated year-round had higher micronucleus frequency than bats from a less disturbed site (15% agriculture). We conclude that the micronucleus test is a sensitive method to evaluate genotoxic effects in free-ranging bats and could provide a useful biomarker for evaluating risk of exposure in wild populations.

AB Current regulatory guidelines for pesticide risk assessment recommend that nonsignificant results should be complemented by the minimum detectable difference (MDD), a statistical indicator that is used to decide whether the experiment could have detected biologically relevant effects. We review the statistical theory of the MDD and perform simulations to understand its properties and error rates. Most importantly, we compare the skill of the MDD in distinguishing between true and false negatives (i.e., type II errors) with 2 alternatives: the minimum detectable effect (MDE), an indicator based on a post hoc power analysis common in medical studies; and confidence intervals (CIs). Our results demonstrate that MDD and MDE only differ in that the power of the MDD depends on the sample size. Moreover, although both MDD and MDE have some skill in distinguishing between false negatives and true absence of an effect, they do not perform as well as using CI upper bounds to establish trust in a nonsignificant result. The reason is that, unlike the CI, neither MDD nor MDE consider the estimated effect size in their calculation. We also show that MDD and MDE are no better than CIs in identifying larger effects among the false negatives. We conclude that, although MDDs are useful, CIs are preferable for deciding whether to treat a nonsignificant test result as a true negative, or for determining an upper bound for an unknown true effect.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-15.

AB Equilibrium passive sampling methods (EPSMs) allow quantification of freely dissolved contaminant concentrations (C-free) in sediment porewater. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a convenient sampling polymer that can be equilibrated in field (in situ) or laboratory (ex situ) sediments to determineC(free), providing reliable compound-specific PDMS-water partition coefficients (KPDMS-water) are available. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are an important class of sediment contaminants comprised of parent and alkylated homologs. However, application of EPSM to alkylated PAHs is challenged by lack ofK(PDMS-water)measurements. Our first objective was to obtainK(PDMS-water)for 9 alkylated PAHs and biphenyls using 3 different PDMS-coated fibers. Quantitative relationships were then established to defineK(PDMS-water)for 18 parent and 16 alkyl PAHs included in the US Environmental Protection Agency's sediment quality benchmark method for benthic life protection based on additive toxic units. The second objective was to compareC(free)in porewater obtained using both in situ and ex situ EPSMs at 6 Baltic Sea locations. The results indicated that in situ and ex situC(free)for alkyl PAHs generally agreed within a factor of 3. Further, all sites exhibited additive toxic units <1, indicating that PAHs pose a low risk to benthos. The results extend practical application of EPSMs for improved risk assessment and derivation of porewater-based remediation goals for PAH-contaminated sediments.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-11.

AB An accurate and sensitive ultrasound-dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction technique followed by high-performance liquid chromatography separation coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry detection method to determine the presence of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in complex environmental matrices is proposed. The miniaturized procedure was used to extract and quantify the analyte in domestic sewage, anaerobic sludge, and the aquatic test organism speciesDaphnia magnaandChironomus sancticaroli, which are standardized organisms for ecotoxicity bioassays. Limits of detection of 2 ng L-1(domestic sewage), 2 ng g(-1)(anaerobic sludge), 0.25 ng g(-1)(D. magna), and 5 ng g(-1)(C. tentans) were obtained. The presence of TBBPA was determined in domestic sewage and anaerobic sludge from an anaerobic batch bioreactor at a concentration of 0.2 +/- 0.03 mu g L(-1)and 507 +/- 79 ng g(-1), respectively. InD. magnaandC. sancticaroliexposed to TBBPA in an acute toxicity bioassay, the micropollutant accumulated at 3.74 and 8.87 mu g g(-1), respectively. The proposed method is a simple and cost-effective tool to determine TBBPA environmental occurrence and biomagnification potential compared with conventional extraction methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first liquid-liquid miniaturized extraction method to be applied toD. magnaandC. sancticaroli. Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-11. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Fish acute toxicity tests are conducted as part of regulatory hazard identification and risk-assessment packages for industrial chemicals and plant protection products. The aim of these tests is to determine the concentration which would be lethal to 50% of the animals treated. These tests are therefore associated with suffering in the test animals, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development test guideline 203 (fish, acute toxicity) studies are the most widely conducted regulatory vertebrate ecotoxicology tests for prospective chemical safety assessment. There is great scope to apply the 3Rs principles-the reduction, refinement, and replacement of animals-in this area of testing. An expert ecotoxicology working group, led by the UK National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research, including members from government, academia, and industry, reviewed global fish acute test data requirements for the major chemical sectors. The present study highlights ongoing initiatives and provides an overview of the key challenges and opportunities associated with replacing, reducing, and/or refining fish acute toxicity studies-without compromising environmental protection.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-14.

AB The organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) commonly used in agricultural practices can pose a risk of potential exposure to humans via food consumption. We describe an analytical method for solid-phase extraction coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (SPE-HPLC-DAD) for the detection of OPPs (quinalphos, diazinon, and chlorpyrifos) in rice grains. The isolation of targeted residues was initiated with double extraction before SPE-HPLC-DAD, crucially reducing matrix interferences and detecting a wide range of multiple residues in rice grains. Coefficients of 0.9968 to 0.9991 showed a strong linearity, with limits of detection and quantification ranging from 0.36 to 0.68 mu g/kg and from 1.20 to 2.28 mu g/kg, respectively. High recoveries (80.4-110.3%) were observed at 3 spiking levels (50, 100, and 200 mu g/kg), indicating good accuracy. The relative standard deviations of all residues (0.19-8.66%) validated the method precision. Sample analysis of 10 rice grain types (n = 30) available in the Asian market revealed that quinalphos, diazinon, and chlorpyrifos at concentrations of 1.08, 1.11, and 1.79 mu g/kg, respectively, remained far below the maximum residue limits (0.01-0.5 mg/kg). However, regular monitoring is necessary to confirm that multiresidue occurrence remains below permissible limits while controlling pests.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-10. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB We evaluated the effect of copper oxide nanomaterials (CuO NMs), uncoated and with 3 different surface coatings (carboxylated, pegylated, and ammonia groups), on acute toxicity and accumulation dynamics in Daphnia magna. With the use of biodynamic modelling, biosorption and elimination rate constants were determined for D. magna following waterborne exposure to dissolved Cu and CuO NMs. The relationship between modeled parameters and acute toxicity endpoints was evaluated to investigate whether accumulation dynamics parameters could be used as a predictor of acute toxicity. The Langmuir equation was used to characterize the biosorption dynamics of Cu NMs and Cu chloride, used as dissolved Cu control. Uptake rates showed the following NM rankings: pristine-CuO > NH3-CuO > aqueous Cu > polyethylene glycol (PEG)-CuO > COOH-CuO. To determine Cu elimination by D. magna, a one-compartment model was used. Different elimination rate constants were estimated for each chemical substance tested. Those that were easily biosorbed were also easily removed from organisms. Biosorption and depuration properties of NMs were correlated with zeta potential values and diameters of NM agglomerates in the suspensions. No link was found between biosorption and toxicity. Waterborne exposures to more difficult-to-biosorb CuO NMs were more likely to induce adverse effects than those that biosorbed easily. It is proposed that some physicochemical properties of NMs in media, including zeta potential and agglomerate diameter, can lead to higher biosorption but do not necessarily affect toxicity. The mode of interaction of the NMs with the organism seems to be complex and to depend on chemical speciation and physicochemical properties of the NMs inside an organism. Moreover, our findings highlight that coating type affects the biosorption dynamics, depuration kinetics, and dissolution rate of NMs in media. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-13. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB The primary goal of the present study is to provide a broad view of best practices for evaluating bioavailability models for metals for use in the protection of aquatic life. We describe the state of the science regarding 1) the evaluation and selection of ecotoxicity data, 2) the selection of bioavailability models for use in normalization, and 3) subsequent application of bioavailability models. Although many examples of normalization steps exist worldwide, a scheme is proposed to evaluate and select a model that takes account of its representativeness (water chemistry and taxonomic coverage of the ecotoxicity data set) and validation performance. Important considerations for a suitable model are the quantity of inputs needed, accuracy, and ease of use, all of which are needed to set protective values for aquatic life and to use these values to evaluate potential risks to organisms in receiving waters. Although the end results of different model application approaches may be broadly similar, the differences in these application frameworks ultimately come down to a series of trade-offs between who needs to collect the data and use the bioavailability model, the different requirements of spatial scales involved (e.g., regional vs site-specific values), and model predictiveness and protectiveness. Ultimately, understanding the limits and consequences of these trade-offs allows for selection of the most appropriate model and application framework to best provide the intended levels of aquatic life protection.

AB Prior to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, we lacked a comprehensive baseline of oil contamination in the Gulf of Mexico's sediments, water column, and biota. Gaps in prespill knowledge limit our ability to determine the aftereffects of the Deepwater Horizon blowout or prepare to mitigate similar impacts during future oil spill disasters. We examined spatiotemporal differences in exposure to and metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in 2 hake species (Urophycis spp.) to establish a current baseline for these ecologically important, abundant, and at-risk demersal fishes. Gulf hake (Urophycis cirrata) and southern hake (Urophycis floridana) were collected throughout the Gulf of Mexico during extensive longline surveys from 2012 to 2015. Analyses of biliary PAH metabolites and liver PAH concentrations provided evidence of exposures to di- and tricyclic compounds, with the highest concentrations measured in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Species-specific differences were not detected, but temporal trends observed in biliary PAHs suggest a decrease in acute exposures, whereas increasing liver PAHs suggest chronic exposures marked by greater assimilation than metabolism rates. To our knowledge, the present study provides the first multitissue contaminant analyses, as well as the most exhaustive biometric analyses, for both gulf and southern hakes. Though sources of exposure are complex because of multiple natural and anthropogenic PAH inputs, these results will facilitate the development of much needed health metrics for Gulf of Mexico benthos.

AB Thallium (Tl) is a trace element associated with base metal mining and processing, but little is known regarding how its toxicity is influenced by water chemistry. In the present study, the 48-h median lethal concentration (LC50) of Tl to Daphnia magna was determined in a standard laboratory water, and toxicity was reassessed under conditions of varying cation (Ca2+, K+, Na+), anion (Cl-, HCO3-), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations. The calculated 48-h LC50 of 1.86 mg Tl/L was consistent with previous work on Tl toxicity to D. magna. At the 48-h LC50 concentration, changes in water chemistry had no statistically significant effect on mortality, although there was a trend toward lower Tl toxicity with elevated water K+. Test waters containing 10 mM CaCl2 did not support control survival. The measurement of Tl complexation with DOM using asymmetric flow field flow fractionation confirmed the outcomes of biogeochemical speciation modeling: Tl speciation was relatively unaffected by water chemistry, and the majority of Tl remained in the ionic form across all treatments. These data indicate that Tl toxicity is largely independent of speciation, a property that will greatly simplify risk assessments for this metal in freshwaters.

AB The use of veterinary medical products and herbicides is a common practice in intensified livestock systems. These compounds affect nontarget organisms that perform important ecosystem functions, such as dung beetles. The assessment of body condition allows us to determine how individuals respond to changes in the environment. However, assessments of how contamination associated with cattle farming affects coprophagous insects such as dung beetles have not been conducted in natural systems. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of ivermectin (an antiparasitic drug) and herbicides on the body condition of 3 species of dung beetles collected in the field: Copris incertus, Euoniticellus intermedius, and Digitonthophagus gazella. We recorded 3 condition indicators (body size, lipid mass, and muscle mass) of beetles collected from 19 livestock ranches in northeastern Mexico. In general, the use of ivermectin had adverse effects on C. incertus and E. intermedius whereas the effects were positive for D. gazella. Conversely, the use of herbicides had adverse effects on D. gazella and positive effects on C. incertus. The different effects of ivermectin and herbicides found in males and females show that sex can be important in determining individual responses to environmental contamination. Importantly, we provide the first evidence under natural conditions that native and exotic species of dung beetles are highly sensitive to different types of livestock management, with veterinary medications and herbicides having the ability to alter body condition. Changes in dung beetle condition can reduce the ecosystem services that dung beetles provide in livestock systems. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-13. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Anticipating, identifying, and prioritizing strategic needs represent essential activities by research organizations. Decided benefits emerge when these pursuits engage globally important environment and health goals, including the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. To this end, horizon scanning efforts can facilitate identification of specific research needs to address grand challenges. We report and discuss 40 priority research questions following engagement of scientists and engineers in North America. These timely questions identify the importance of stimulating innovation and developing new methods, tools, and concepts in environmental chemistry and toxicology to improve assessment and management of chemical contaminants and other diverse environmental stressors. Grand challenges to achieving sustainable management of the environment are becoming increasingly complex and structured by global megatrends, which collectively challenge existing sustainable environmental quality efforts. Transdisciplinary, systems-based approaches will be required to define and avoid adverse biological effects across temporal and spatial gradients. Similarly, coordinated research activities among organizations within and among countries are necessary to address the priority research needs reported here. Acquiring answers to these 40 research questions will not be trivial, but doing so promises to advance sustainable environmental quality in the 21st century. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1606-1624.

AB The medaka extended one-generation reproduction test (MEOGRT) is a tier-2 study in the US Environmental Protection Agency's Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program and a level-5 study in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's conceptual framework. Integrating nonspecific apical and endocrine-specific mechanistic endpoints, results of a MEOGRT can be used, with other data, in a weight-of-evidence evaluation to establish a dose-response relationship for risk assessment and identify potential causal relationships between an endocrine mode of action and adverse effects. The MEOGRT test design was used to evaluate the multigenerational effects of the antimicrobial agent triclosan. Japanese medaka were exposed to nominal concentrations of 1.4, 2.8, 5.6, 11, and 23 mu g/L triclosan and a dilution water control starting with adult medaka (F0) through hatch in the second generation (F2). No consistent or concentration-related responses occurred in the 182-d test that suggested an endocrine-mediated effect. There were no impacts on hepatic vitellogenin, secondary sex characteristics, or sex ratio that were linked to an adverse reproductive outcome. Histopathological responses were consistent with a toxic or stress effect, particularly when considered in context with observed reductions in growth. The overall population-relevant no-observed-effect concentration was 11 mu g/L based on effects on growth. The results of the present study support a previously conducted weight-of-evidence evaluation concluding that triclosan does not act as an agonist or antagonist within estrogen, androgen, thyroid, or steroidogenic pathways.

AB Two analytical methods were developed for the determination of 48 organic compounds and 20 of their main by-products in fish matrices. The targeted compounds belong to various chemical classes of metabolizable (phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, insecticides [pyrethroids and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide]) and legacy (organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers) pollutants. Analyses were performed by gas and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and dynamic MRM, respectively. Method performances were satisfactory, with results meeting the validation criteria because they achieved good linearity responses, recovery, precision, and accuracy for most of the 68 investigated compounds. The methods were then applied on 3 feral chub (Squalius cephalus) collected from the Marne hydrographic network (France). Twenty-six parent compounds and 5 metabolites were systematically detected in fish matrices, with substantial concentration variability within and among individuals. Phthalates and pyrethroids accounted for most of the pollutant load. Metabolite concentrations in liver samples exceeded those of parent molecules in fish muscle. The present study presents 2 reliable methods for the determination of a wide range of contaminants and underlines the importance of metabolite analysis for a more comprehensive understanding of pollutant bioaccumulation and fate in aquatic organisms.

TI A pulsed-dose study evaluating chronic toxicity of chlorothalonil to
   fish: A case study for environmental risk assessment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPOSURE; GROWTH; RECOVERY; SURVIVAL
AB Chlorothalonil is a fungicide which is highly toxic to aquatic organisms. However, in natural aquatic environments, it is very rapidly degraded, with a half-life typically in hours, reducing exposure of aquatic organisms and the potential for effects. In standard regulatory studies looking at the chronic toxicity of chlorothalonil to fathead minnow, the most sensitive endpoint was fecundity. A standard fish full-life cycle study, where chlorothalonil concentrations were maintained constant throughout, resulted in a no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) of 1.4 mu g/L. Comparing peak modeled exposure concentrations to this NOEC can result in the chronic risk to fish being considered unacceptable. The present study investigated the effect on fecundity in fathead minnow using a fish short-term reproduction assay. Five different exposure profiles were employed with time-varying concentrations based on realistic worst-case modeled environmental exposure profiles, multiplied by an assessment factor of 10, which resulted in maximum measured concentrations up to 15.5 mu g/L. There were no effects on fecundity from any of the exposure profiles tested. Therefore, based on these more realistic exposure profiles, the chronic risk to fish could be considered acceptable if these exposures were deemed to be representative of the worst case.

AB Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have been found in human samples and associated with adverse health effects. In the present study, OPFR and dialkyl and diaryl phosphate (DAP) concentrations in human urine were determined and differences in the concentrations in urine from males and females were investigated. Urine samples from 22 male and 26 female university students, paired dust samples from the dormitories (13 each for males and females), and 10 dust samples from university teaching buildings were analyzed. The tri-o-cresyl phosphate (TOCP), tri-p-cresyl phosphate (TPCP), and tris(2-chloroisopropyl)phosphate (TCIPP) concentrations were significantly higher (p = 0.049, 0.023, and 0.027, respectively) in urine from the female students than in urine from the male students. Similar differences were found between males and females in terms of OPFR exposure and OPFR concentrations in urine for three-fourths of the OPFRs. Questionnaire answers and calculations indicated that disparities in OPFR concentrations in urine were mainly caused by females spending much more time than males in dormitories. Organophosphate flame retardants may pose degrees of health risk similar to those of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and this must be considered when making decisions about controlling flame retardants. We are not aware of any previous studies that simultaneously monitor OPFRs and DAPs in human urine in China. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:760-768. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB A database was compiled for algal Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) test guideline 201, for Daphnia magna OECD test guideline 202, for the acute fish toxicity (AFT) OECD test guideline 203, and for the fish embryo toxicity (FET) OECD test guideline 236 to assess the suitability and applicability of the FET test in a threshold approach context. In the threshold approach, algal and Daphnia toxicity are assessed first, after which a limit test is conducted at the lower of the 2 toxicity values using fish. If potential fish toxicity is indicated, a full median lethal concentration assay is performed. This tiered testing strategy can significantly reduce the number of fish used in toxicity testing because algae or Daphnia are typically more sensitive than fish. A total of 165 compounds had AFT and FET data available, and of these, 82 had algal and Daphnia acute toxicity data available. Algae and Daphnia were more sensitive 75 to 80% of the time. Fish or FET tests were most sensitive 20 and 16% of the time, respectively, when considered as the sole fish toxicity indicator and 27% of the time when both were considered simultaneously. When fish were the most sensitive trophic level, different compounds were identified as the most toxic in FET and to AFT tests; however, the differences were not so large that they resulted in substantially different outcomes when potencies were binned using the United Nations categories of aquatic toxicity under the Globally Harmonized System for classification and labeling. It is recommended that the FET test could be used to directly replace the AFT test in the threshold approach or could be used as the definitive test if an AFT limit test indicated toxicity potential for a chemical.

AB Anthropogenic activities such as the use of pesticides may affect aquatic biota populations, due to potential agricultural runoffs or disposals. Carbendazim is one example of a widely used fungicide with a high potential to end up in aquatic ecosystems through runoff. Deleterious effects observed at the individual level are possibly explained by changes in homeostasis at the cellular level, and both factors can then be used to predict effects at the population level. In the present study, an isoclonal population of Daphnia magna (clone K6) was exposed to a concentration that mimics relevant levels of carbendazim in the environment over 12 generations. The effects of carbendazim were assessed in some generations using the following endpoints: biochemical biomarkers (cholinesterase, catalase, and glutathione-S-transferase), lipid peroxidation and energy-related parameters (carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins along with available energy and energy consumption), parental longevity, and population growth (r). Long-term exposure to carbendazim had no effect on the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) of adult D. magna, but longevity was decreased at the F12 generation compared to that of control. Differences between the exposed and nonexposed populations were found for cholinesterase, glutathione-S-transferase, and lipid peroxidation. However, for catalase and energy-related parameters, no differences were observed between these 2 populations. Natural variability was seen throughout the test period, under control conditions, within the 12 generations. Overall, carbendazim induced some effects at the subcellular level that translated into changes in longevity but these later vanished in terms of population effects.

AB A database of 2049 chemicals with 47 associated modes of action (MoA) was compiled from the literature. The database includes alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, inorganic, and polar compounds. Brief descriptions of some critical MoA classification groups are provided. The MoA from the 14 sources were assigned using a variety of reliable experimental and modeling techniques. Toxicity information, chemical parameters, and solubility limits were combined with the MoA label information to create the data set used for model development. The model database was used to generate linear free energy relationships for each specific MoA using multilinear regression analysis. The model uses chemical-specific Abraham solute parameters estimated from AbSolv to determine MoA-specific solvent parameters. With this procedure, critical target site concentrations are determined for each genus. Statistical analysis showed a wide range in values of the solvent parameters for the significant MoA.

AB The toxicity of petroleum can increase considerably after exposure to solar radiation, during which certain components in the mixture, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), absorb light in ultraviolet and visible portions of the solar radiation spectrum. A phototoxic target lipid model (PTLM), previously developed to predict the phototoxicity of single PAHs, is validated for 4 species (Americamysis bahia, Rhepoxynius abronius, Daphnia magna, and Pimephales promelas) exposed to 12 compounds that are components of petroleum, including alkylated PAHs and dibenzothiophene. The PTLM is also used to predict the phototoxicity of binary and ternary mixtures of 3 PAHs, pyrene, anthracene, and fluoranthene, to A. bahia and Menidia beryllina. Finally, it is used to predict the toxicity of water accommodated fractions of neat and naturally weathered Macondo crude oil samples from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill sites. The Gulf of Mexico species, including A. bahia, M. beryllina, Cyprinodon variegatus, and Fundulus grandis were exposed to the oil samples under natural and simulated solar radiation. The results support the applicability of the PTLM for predicting the phototoxicity of petroleum. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2165-2174. (c) 2018 SETAC.

AB There is concern over whether regulatory criteria for copper (Cu) are protective against chemosensory and behavioral impairment in aquatic organisms. We compiled Cu toxicity data for these and other sublethal endpoints in 35 tests with saltwater organisms and compared the Cu toxicity thresholds with biotic ligand model (BLM)-based estimated chronic limits (ECL values, which are 20% effect concentrations [EC20s] for the embryo-larval life stage of the blue mussel [Mytilus edulis], a saltwater species sensitive to Cu that has historically been used to derive saltwater Cu criteria). Only 8 of the 35 tests had sufficient toxicity and chemistry data to support unequivocal conclusions (i.e., a Cu EC20 or no-observed-effect concentration could be derived, and Cu and dissolved organic carbon [DOC] concentrations were measured [or DOC concentrations could be inferred from the test-water source]). The BLM-based ECL values would have been protective (i.e., the ECL was lower than the toxicity threshold) in 7 of those 8 tests. In the remaining 27 tests, this meta-analysis was limited by several factors, including 1) the Cu toxicity threshold was a less than value in 19 tests because only a lowest-observed-effect concentration could be calculated and 2) Cu and/or DOC concentrations often were not measured. In 2 of those 27 tests, the ECL would not have been protective if based only on a conservatively high upper-bound DOC estimate. To facilitate future evaluations of the protectiveness of aquatic life criteria for metals, we urge researchers to measure and report exposure-water chemistry and test-metal concentrations that bracket regulatory criteria.

AB A meta-analysis was conducted of studies that reported behavior and chemo/mechanosensory responses by fish, amphibians, and aquatic invertebrates in Cu-containing waters and also reported sufficient water chemistry for calculation of hardness-based and biotic ligand model (BLM)-based water quality criteria (WQC) for Cu. The calculated WQC concentrations were then compared with the corresponding 20% impairment concentrations (IC20) of Cu for those behavior and chemo/mechanosensory responses. The hardness-based acute and chronic WQC for Cu would not have been protective (i.e., the IC20 would have been lower than the WQC) in 33.6 and 26.2%, respectively, of the 107 combined behavior- and chemo/mechanosensory-response cases that also had adequate water chemistry data for BLM-based WQC calculations (32.7% inconclusive). In comparison, the BLM-based acute and chronic WQC for Cu would not have been protective in only 10.3 and 4.7%, respectively, of the same 107 cases (29.9% inconclusive). To improve evaluations of regulatory effectiveness, researchers conducting aquatic Cu toxicity tests should measure and report complete BLM-input water chemistry and bracket the hardness-based and BLM-based WQC concentrations for Cu that would be applicable in their exposure waters. This meta-analysis demonstrates that, overall, the BLM-based WQC for Cu were considerably more protective than the hardness-based WQC for Cu against impairment of behavior and chemo/mechanosensory responses.

AB There is a need to determine time-weighted average concentrations of polar contaminants such as pesticides by passive sampling in environmental waters. Calibration data for silicone rubber-based passive samplers are lacking for this class of compounds. The calibration data, sampling rate (R-s), and partition coefficient between silicone rubber and water (K-sw) were precisely determined for 23 pesticides and 13 candidate performance reference compounds (PRCs) in a laboratory calibration system over 14 d for 2 water flow velocities, 5 and 20 cm s(-1). The results showed that an in situ exposure duration of 7 d left a silicone rubber rod passive sampler configuration in the linear or curvilinear uptake period for 19 of the pesticides studied. A change in the transport mechanism from polymer control to water boundary layer control was observed for pesticides with a log K-sw of approximately 3.3. The PRC candidates were not fully relevant to correct the impact of water flow velocity on R-s. We therefore propose an alternative method based on an overall resistance to mass transfer model to adjust R-s from laboratory experiments to in situ hydrodynamic conditions. We estimated diffusion coefficients (D-s) and thickness of water boundary layer (delta(w)) as adjustable model parameters. Log D-s values ranged from -12.13 to -10.07 m(2) s(-1). The estimated delta(w) value showed a power function correlation with water flow velocity. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB To be defined as an endocrine disruptor, a substance has to meet several criteria, including the induction of specific adverse effects, a specific endocrine mode of action, and a plausible link between both. The latter criterion in particular might not always be unequivocally determined, especially because the endocrine system consists of diverse endocrine axes. The axes closely interact with each other, and manipulation of one triggers effects on the other. The present review aimed to identify some of the many interconnections between these axes. The focus was on fish, but data obtained in studies on amphibians and mammals were considered if they assisted in closing data gaps, because most of the endocrine mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved. The review includes data both from ecotoxicological studies and on physiological processes and gives information on hormone/hormone receptor interactions or gene transcription regulation. The key events and key event relationships identified provide explanations for unexpected effects on one axis, exerted by substances suspected to act specifically on another axis. Based on these data, several adverse outcome pathway (AOP) segments are identified, describing connections between the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axes, the HPG and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal (HPA/I) axes, and the HPT and HPA/I axes. Central key events identified across axes were altered aromatase activity as well as altered expression and function of the proteins 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD) and steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein. Substance classes that act on more than one endocrine axis were, for example, goitrogens or aromatase inhibitors. Despite the wealth of information gathered, the present review only provides a few insights into the molecular nets of endocrine axes, demonstrating the complexity of their interconnections.

AB Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are flame retardant polymer additives that are widely detected in outdoor and indoor environments. Release of PBDEs from consumer products leads to high concentrations indoors, but mechanisms of release are poorly understood. Although ingestion of dust is a well-studied indoor PBDE exposure route, the importance of inhalation exposure is uncertain. To address these unknowns, dust was collected from household vacuum cleaners, and suspended particulate matter was collected from the same homes in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, using a cascade impactor. Size-fractionated particulate matter samples (0.01-18 mu m diameter) were analyzed for PBDEs. The sum of PBDEs in all particulate matter ranged from 8.7 +/- 0.5 to 15.7 +/- 0.5 pg/m(3), with >50% of PBDE mass in respirable particulate matter (<1 mu m). Mass loadings as a function of particle size suggested that both abrasion and off-gassing led to the presence of PBDEs in particulate matter. Variability in the particulate matter mass loadings indicated that emission mechanisms were both product-and location-dependent. Congener profiles in colocated vacuum dust and particulate matter samples were different, indicating that vacuum dust cannot accurately predict PBDE congeners in respirable particulate matter. A calculated lower limit inhalation exposure to PBDEs (0.19 ng/d) is lower than exposure via diet or ingestion of dust, although the different biochemical pathways for inhalation compared with ingestion may have different biological effects. The present study highlights the importance of contaminant analysis in size-fractionated particulate matter to assess human exposure via inhalation compared with traditional vacuum dust methods.

AB Freshwater biota are usually exposed to mixtures of different metals in the environment, which raises concern because risk-assessment procedures for metals are still mainly based on single-metal toxicity. Because microalgae are primary producers and therefore at the base of the food web, it is of utmost importance to understand the effects of metal mixtures on these organisms. Most studies that have investigated the combined interactive effects of mixtures on microalgae performed tests in only one specific water. The objective of the present study was to test if combined effects of mixtures to Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata were the same or different across natural waters showing diverse water-chemistry characteristics. This was done by performing experiments with ternary Cu-Ni-Zn mixtures in 3 natural waters and with binary Cu-Ni mixtures in 5 natural waters. We showed that the ternary mixture acted noninteractively on algal growth, except in one water in which the mixture acted antagonistically. We suggest that a low-cationic competition situation in the latter water could be the reason for the antagonistic interaction between the metals. On the other hand, the binary mixture acted noninteractively on algal growth in all tested waters. We showed that both the concentration addition and independent action models can serve as accurate models for toxicity of ternary Cu-Ni-Zn and binary Cu-Ni mixtures to P. subcapitata in most cases and as protective models in all cases. In addition, we developed a metal mixture bioavailability model, by combining the independent action model and the single-metal bioavailability models, that can be used to predict Cu-Ni-Zn and Cu-Ni toxicity to P. subcapitata as a function of metal concentration and water characteristics.

AB The chemistry, bioavailability, and toxicity of aluminum (Al) in the aquatic environment are complex and affected by a wide range of water quality characteristics (including pH, hardness, and dissolved organic carbon). Data gaps in Al ecotoxicology exist for pH ranges representative of natural surface waters (pH 6-8). To address these gaps, a series of chronic toxicity tests were performed at pH 6 with 8 freshwater species, including 2 fish (Pimephales promelas and Danio rerio), an oligochaete (Aeolosoma sp.), a rotifer (Brachionus calyciflorus), a snail (Lymnaea stagnalis), an amphipod (Hyalella azteca), a midge (Chironomus riparius), and an aquatic plant (Lemna minor). The 10% effect concentrations (EC10s) ranged from 98 mg total Al/L for D. rerio to 2175 mg total Al/L for L. minor. From these data and additional published data, species-sensitivity distributions (SSDs) were developed to derive concentrations protective of 95% of tested species (i.e., 50% lower confidence limit of a 5th percentile hazard concentration [HC5-50]). A generic HC5-50 (not adjusted for bioavailability) of 74.4mg total Al/L was estimated using the SSD. An Al-specific biotic ligand model (BLM) was used to develop SSDs normalized for bioavailability based on site-specific water quality characteristics. Normalized HC5-50s ranged from 93.7 to 534mg total Al/L for waters representing a range of European ecoregions, whereas a chronic HC5 calculated using US Environmental Protection Agency aquatic life criteria methods (i.e., a continuous criterion concentration [CCC]) was 125mg total Al/L when normalized to Lake Superior water in the United States. The HC5-50 and CCC values for site-specific waters other than those in the present study can be obtained using the Al BLM. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Treatment of municipal wastewater reduces the concentrations of some pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), hormones, and drugs of abuse. However, reduced concentrations of these micropollutants in wastewater may not correlate with reduced toxicity because transformations of micropollutants and/or the formation of disinfection by-products may generate toxic compounds. In the present study, we prepared extracts by solid phase extraction of samples collected from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) at various stages of treatment and tested these extracts for toxicity to early life stages of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). Toxicity data for extracts prepared from a WWTP with secondary treatment showed that the numbers of exposed embryos (n = 12 per treatment) that did not hatch increased from 1 of 12 for the treatment with untreated effluent to 5 of 12 for the treatment with final treated effluent. For extracts prepared from a WWTP with tertiary treatment, toxicity among exposed embryos (n = 12 per treatment) also increased with each step of wastewater treatment, as shown by mortalities of 2 of 12 and 8 of 12 in treatments with extracts from untreated and final treated effluent, respectively, as well as an increase in the numbers of embryos that did not hatch from 2 of 12 to 9 of 12 in treatments with untreated and final treated effluent, respectively. Ozonation of treated wastewater collected from a third WWTP caused a high incidence of delayed hatch in exposed embryos (n = 24 per treatment). However, hatching success and the numbers of developmental abnormalities in embryos from this ozonation treatment were not different from controls. The present study shows the value of including toxicity testing to assess the effectiveness of technologies for treatment of municipal wastewater. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB An acute sediment toxicity test using the ostracod Heterocypris incongruens is user friendly and has high sensitivity; however, a life-cycle test using this species has not been developed. The most challenging problem when developing a life-cycle test is that the egg development time varies greatly and is sometimes too long (> 150 d) to monitor. It is desirable to shorten the duration of life-cycle toxicity tests including the observation period of egg development while preserving the ecological relevance of the net reproductive rate (R-0), an endpoint in the life-cycle test. Therefore, in the present study, we suggest a practical test duration for R-0 using population growth rate () as a measure of ecological relevance. We collected a range of life history characteristics of the ostracod by combining data from the literature and experimental results, constructed population matrix models, and calculated for 20 life history patterns. The results showed that a longer test period (> 150 d) did not increase the correlation coefficients between R-0 and . Rather, a shorter test duration resulted in R-0 being highly correlated with . Our results suggest that a life-cycle toxicity test using the ostracod can provide an ecologically relevant toxicity endpoint, even if the test is abandoned after approximately 50 d and unhatched eggs remain.

AB The present study aimed to investigate the influence of different fractions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on the uptake and toxicity of nickel (Ni) in the soil invertebrate Enchytraeus crypticus after different exposure times. The addition of DOC as humic acid or fulvic acid significantly reduced Ni uptake by E. crypticus in the soil-solution test system. Median lethal effect concentrations were calculated based on total dissolved Ni concentrations (LC50[Ni]), free Ni ion activity (LC50{Ni2+}), and Ni body concentrations (LC50(Body-Ni)). The LC50[Ni] values increased with increasing DOC levels and decreased with exposure time (4, 7, and 10 d). Humic acid exerted a greater protective effect on Ni toxicity than fulvic acid, but the protective effects decreased with prolonged exposure time. The LC50{Ni2+} values also decreased with exposure time but were almost constant with variation in DOC levels, indicating that the protective effect of DOC is mainly through complexation with free Ni ions to reduce Ni bioavailability. The LC50(Body-Ni) value was independent of DOC concentration and exposure time, with an estimated overall value of 22.1 mu g/g dry weight. The present study shows that body concentration could serve as an effective indicator for predicting Ni toxicity with variations in the exposure environment (e.g., DOC) and exposure time.

AB Biomarkers are widely used in ecotoxicology as indicators of exposure to toxicants. However, their ability to provide ecologically relevant information remains controversial. One of the major problems is understanding whether the measured responses are determined by stress factors or lie within the natural variability range. In a previous work, the natural variability of enzymatic levels in invertebrates sampled in pristine rivers was proven to be relevant across both space and time. In the present study, the experimental design was improved by considering different life stages of the selected taxa and by measuring more environmental parameters. The experimental design considered sampling sites in 2 different rivers, 8 sampling dates covering the whole seasonal cycle, 4 species from 3 different taxonomic groups (Plecoptera, Perla grandis; Ephemeroptera, Baetis alpinus and Epeorus alpicula; Tricoptera, Hydropsyche pellucidula), different life stages for each species, and 4 enzymes (acetylcholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and catalase). Biomarker levels were related to environmental (physicochemical) parameters to verify any kind of dependence. Data were statistically elaborated using hierarchical multilevel Bayesian models. Natural variability was found to be relevant across both space and time. The results of the present study proved that care should be paid when interpreting biomarker results. Further research is needed to better understand the dependence of the natural variability on environmental parameters. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3158-3167. (c) 2017 SETAC

AB Chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (Cl-PFESA; trade name F-53B) is an alternative product for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) used in metal plating; little is known about its levels in the environment and its risks. To our knowledge, the present study constitutes the first report of Cl-PFESA in the atmosphere. In 2006 to 2014, C8 Cl-PFESA, along with ionic perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), was detected in atmospheric particulate matter in Dalian, China. Concentrations of C8 Cl-PFESA increased from 140 pg/m(3) in 2007 to 722 pg/m(3) in 2014. Levels of 11 (total) ionic PFAAs increased in 2006 to 2008 and decreased afterward, with a range of 35.7 to 860 pg/m(3). The PFAAs in the particulate matter were dominated by perfluorocarboxylates, with perfluorooctanoate detected at the highest concentration at a mean level of 71.7 pg/m(3), followed by perfluoroheptanoate and perfluorohexanoate. Perfluorosulfonates were detected at lower levels, with mean concentrations of PFOS, perfluorobutanesulfonate, and perfluorohexane sulfonate of 5.73, 1.64, and 1.24 pg/m(3), respectively. Back-trajectory analysis suggested that the air mass approaching Dalian during the sampling originated from the northwest, where fluorochemical industry parks and metal plating industries are densely located. No significant correlation was observed between Cl-PFESA and the ionic PFAAs. The relatively high Cl-PFESA concentrations suggested that it possibly contributed largely to the previously reported exposure to undefined organic fluorine compounds, for which further research on emission and environmental risks is needed.

AB Bivalves show remarkable plasticity to environmental changes and have been proposed as sentinel organisms in biomonitoring. Studies related to transcriptional analysis using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in these organisms have notably increased, imposing a need to identify and validate adequate reference genes for an accurate and reliable analysis. In the present study, 9 reference genes were selected from transcriptome data of Crassostrea brasiliana to identify their suitability as qRT-PCR normalizer genes. The transcriptional patterns were analyzed in gills of oysters under 3 different conditions: different temperatures (18, 24, or 32 degrees C) and phenanthrene (100 mu gL(-1)) combined exposure; different salinities (10, 25, or 35%) and phenanthrene combined exposure; and 10% of diesel fuel water-accommodated fraction (diesel-WAF) exposure. Reference gene stability was calculated using 5 algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, Delta Ct, RefFinder). Transcripts of ankyrin-like (ANK), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-like (GAPDH), and alpha-tubulin-like (TUBA) genes showed minor changes in different temperature/phenanthrene treatment. Transcripts of ANK, beta-actin-like, and beta-tubulin-like genes showed better stability at salinity/phenanthrene treatment, and ANK, TUBA, and 28S ribosomal protein-like genes showed the most stable transcription pattern in oysters exposed to diesel-WAF exposure. The present study constitutes the first systematic analysis of reference gene selection for qRT-PCR normalization in C. brasiliana. These genes could be employed in studies using qRT-PCR analysis under similar experimental conditions. (C) 2017 SETAC.

AB Although the use of engineered nanomaterials continues to increase, how these materials interact with coexisting contaminants in the environment is largely unknown. The effect of silver (Ag) in bulk, ionic, and nanoparticle (NP; bare and polyvinyl pyrrolidone-coated) forms at 3 concentrations (0 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, 1000 mg/kg, 2000 mg/kg; ion at 69 mg/kg, 138 mg/kg, 276 mg/kg) on the accumulation of field-weathered chlordane and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene+metabolites (DDX) by Eisenia fetida (earthworm) was investigated. Earthworm biomass and survival were unaffected by treatment. At the 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg exposure levels, NP-exposed earthworms contained significantly greater Ag (194-245%) than did the bulk exposed organisms; NP size or coating had no impact on element content. Generally, exposure to Ag of any type or at any concentration significantly reduced pesticide accumulation, although reductions for DDX (35.1%; 8.9-47.0%) were more modest than those for chlordane (79.0%; 17.4-92.9%). For DDX, the reduction in pesticide accumulation was not significantly affected by Ag type or concentration. For chlordane, the 3 NP exposures suppressed chlordane accumulation significantly more than did bulk exposure; earthworms exposed to bulk Ag contained 1170 ng/g chlordane, but levels in the NP-exposed earthworms were 279 ng/g. At the 500 mg/kg exposure, the smallest coated NPs exerted the greatest suppression in chlordane accumulation; at the 2 higher concentrations, chlordane uptake was unaffected by NP size or coating. The findings show that in exposed earthworms Ag particle size does significantly impact accumulation of the element itself, as well as that of coexisting weathered pesticides. The implications of these findings with regard to NP exposure and risk are unknown but are the topic of current investigation. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The aquatic food web of the Great Lakes has been contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) since the mid-20th century. Threats of PCB exposures to long-lived species of fish, such as lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), have been uncertain because of a lack of information on the relative sensitivity of the species. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the sensitivity of early-life stage lake sturgeon to 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB- 126) or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure. Mortality, growth, morphological and tissue pathologies, swimming performance, and activity levels were used as assessment endpoints. Pericardial and yolk sac edema, tubular heart, yolk sac hemorrhaging, and small size were the most commonly observed pathologies in both TCDD and PCB-126 exposures, beginning as early as 4 d postfertilization, with many of these pathologies occurring in a dose-dependent manner. Median lethal doses for PCB-126 and TCDD in lake sturgeon were 5.4ng/g egg (95% confidence interval, 3.9-7.4ng/g egg) and 0.61ng/g egg (0.47-0.82ng/g egg), respectively. The resulting relative potency factor for PCB-126 (0.11) was greater than the World Health Organization estimate for fish (toxic equivalency factor=0.005), suggesting that current risk assessments may underestimate PCB toxicity toward lake sturgeon. Swimming activity and endurance were reduced in lake sturgeon survivors from the median lethal doses at 60d postfertilization. Threshold and median toxicity values indicate that lake sturgeon, like other Acipenser species, are more sensitive to PCB and TCDD than the other genus of sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus, found in North America. Indeed, lake sturgeon populations in the Great Lakes and elsewhere are susceptible to PCB/TCDD-induced developmental toxicity in embryos and reductions in swimming performance.

AB The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulted in the accidental release of millions of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Photo-induced toxicity following co-exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is 1 mechanism by which polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from oil spills may exert toxicity. Red drum and speckled seatrout are both important fishery resources in the Gulf of Mexico. They spawn near-shore and produce positively buoyant embryos that hatch into larvae in approximately 24 h. The goal of the present study was to determine whether exposure to UV as natural sunlight enhances the toxicity of crude oil to early lifestage red drum and speckled seatrout. Larval fish were exposed to several dilutions of high-energy water-accommodated fractions (HEWAFs) from 2 different oils collected in the field under chain of custody during the 2010 spill and 3 gradations of natural sunlight in a factorial design. Co-exposure to natural sunlight and oil significantly reduced larval survival compared with exposure to oil alone. Although both species were sensitive at PAH concentrations reported during the Deepwater Horizon spill, speckled seatrout demonstrated a greater sensitivity to photo-induced toxicity than red drum. These data demonstrate that even advanced weathering of slicks does not ameliorate the potential for photo-induced toxicity of oil to these species. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Traditional duckweed toxicity tests only measure plant growth inhibition as an endpoint, with limited effects-based data. The present study aimed to investigate whether Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy could enhance the duckweed (Lemna minor L.) toxicity test. Four chemicals (Cu, Cd, atrazine, and acetochlor) and 4 metal-containing industrial wastewater samples were tested. After exposure of duckweed to the chemicals, standard toxicity endpoints (frond number and chlorophyll content) were determined; the fronds were also interrogated using FTIR spectroscopy under optimized test conditions. Biochemical alterations associated with each treatment were assessed and further analyzed by multivariate analysis. The results showed that comparable x% of effective concentration (ECx) values could be achieved based on FTIR spectroscopy in comparison with those based on traditional toxicity endpoints. Biochemical alterations associated with different doses of toxicant were mainly attributed to lipid, protein, nucleic acid, and carbohydrate structural changes, which helped to explain toxic mechanisms. With the help of multivariate analysis, separation of clusters related to different exposure doses could be achieved. The present study is the first to show successful application of FTIR spectroscopy in standard duckweed toxicity tests with biochemical alterations as new endpoints.

AB Determining the fate of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) in the environment requires the use of predictive models for compounds and conditions for which experimental data are insufficient. Previous studies have developed linear free energy relationships (LFERs) that relate the thermodynamic energy of NAC reduction to its corresponding rate constant. We present a comprehensive LFER that incorporates both the reduction and oxidation half-reactions through quantum chemically calculated energies.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-7. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Knowledge of the fractionation of mercury in soils in the vicinity of abandoned cinnabar mines is essential for assessing the usability of soils for the cultivation of agriculturally important crops. Two different sequential extraction methods and the technique of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) were applied and compared for fractionation of mercury in soils from mercury-contaminated sites intended for farming purposes. The mercury found in these soils was primarily in the form of mercury sulfide (58.6-83.9%), followed by 6.7 to 15.4% of organically bound mercury and 2.9 to 23.2% of elemental mercury. Up to 10.3% of labile mercury species were determined by both sequential extraction methods in these soils. However, only 0.01 to 0.13% of mercury was determined as a bioavailable fraction using the DGT technique. Both sequential extraction methods tested for the fractionation analysis of mercury in contaminated soils were in excellent agreement. The content of the mobile (labile) mercury determined by the sequential extraction methods was statistically significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than the content of bioavailable mercury determined by the DGT technique.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-8.

AB Environmental and human health challenges are pronounced in Asia, an exceptionally diverse and complex region where influences of global megatrends are extensive and numerous stresses to environmental quality exist. Identifying priorities necessary to engage grand challenges can be facilitated through horizon scanning exercises, and to this end we identified and examined 23 priority research questions needed to advance toward more sustainable environmental quality in Asia, as part of the Global Horizon Scanning Project. Advances in environmental toxicology, environmental chemistry, biological monitoring, and risk-assessment methodologies are necessary to address the adverse impacts of environmental stressors on ecosystem services and biodiversity, with Asia being home to numerous biodiversity hotspots. Intersections of the food-energy-water nexus are profound in Asia; innovative and aggressive technologies are necessary to provide clean water, ensure food safety, and stimulate energy efficiency, while improving ecological integrity and addressing legacy and emerging threats to public health and the environment, particularly with increased aquaculture production. Asia is the largest chemical-producing continent globally. Accordingly, sustainable and green chemistry and engineering present decided opportunities to stimulate innovation and realize a number of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Engaging the priority research questions identified herein will require transdisciplinary coordination through existing and nontraditional partnerships within and among countries and sectors. Answering these questions will not be easy but is necessary to achieve more sustainable environmental quality in Asia.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-21.

AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of highly fluorinated synthetic chemicals that were originally developed for uses as surfactants and surface protectors. Increasingly, specific substances of this class are being found in environmental media (e.g., surface water, soils, sediments, food sources), and concerns regarding exposure to humans and environmental receptors have been described by the public, legislators, and the general population. Data suggest that some PFAS (such as certain of the long-chain ones) bioaccumulate and have long biological half-lives, particularly in humans. Toxicity data in various organisms are variable as are their toxicokinetics. A Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) Focused Topic Meeting and workshop entitled Environmental Risk Assessment of PFAS convened during 12 to 15 August, 2019 in Durham, North Carolina (USA) and brought together experts from around the globe to highlight recent advances in research pertinent to evaluating environmental and human health risks from exposures. The objectives of the Focused Topic Meeting and workshop were: 1) to review new and emerging information on PFAS chemical classification and grouping, environmental chemistry, detection technology, fate and transport, exposure potential, human health toxicity, and ecological toxicity; and 2) to harness the expertise of attendees to discuss and formulate a roadmap to prioritize the study of specific PFAS with the goal of developing a risk assessment approach that considers mechanistic (including computational) data for extrapolating exposure and data across different species/scenarios and compounds within environmental exposure pathways. We present the key issues that were discussed.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-7. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB The environmental risk assessment of rare earth elements (REEs) requires data on their potential toxicity. In the present study, the toxicity of lanthanum (La) and cerium (Ce) was studied in relation to metal speciation in solution. For both La and Ce, the use of organic ligands demonstrated that the calculated free ion concentration was a good indicator of toxicity. Whether in the absence or presence of organic ligands, when based on free ion concentrations, the obtained half-maximal effective concentrations were similar. When all generated data were pooled, Ce and La showed identical toxicity thresholds after 120 h of exposure with free ion concentration-based median effective concentration values (95% confidence intervals) of 0.48 (0.38-0.60) mu M and 0.47 (0.36-0.61) mu M for La3+ and Ce3+, respectively. The inhibition of algal growth was also correlated with the intracellular lanthanide concentrations, regardless of the ligand used. Finally, increasing the ambient calcium concentration protected the test algae by reducing the amount of lanthanide internalized into the cells. These results suggest that, at constant pH (5.5), REE accumulation and toxicity are linked to the free ion concentration and ambient calcium concentration, as predicted by the biotic ligand model.

AB We describe 2 artificial stream experiments that exposed aquatic insect communities to zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and cadmium (year 2014) and to Zn, Cu, and nickel (year 2015). The testing strategy was to concurrently expose insect communities to single metals and mixtures. Single-metal tests were repeated to evaluate the reproducibility of the methods and year-to-year variability. Metals were strongly accumulated in sediments, periphyton, and insect (caddisfly) tissues, with the highest concentrations occurring in periphyton. Sensitive mayflies declined in metal treatments, and effect concentrations could be predicted effectively from metal concentrations in either periphyton or water. Most responses were similar in the replicated tests, but median effect concentration values for the mayfly Rhithrogena sp. varied 20-fold between the tests, emphasizing the difficulty comparing sensitivities across studies and the value of repeated testing. Relative to the single-metal responses, the toxicity of the mixtures was either approximately additive or less than additive when calculated as the product of individual responses (response addition). However, even less-than-additive relative responses were sometimes greater than responses to similar concentrations tested singly. The ternary mixtures resulted in mayfly declines at concentrations that caused no declines in the concurrent single-metal tests. When updating species-sensitivity distributions (SSDs) with these results, the mayfly responses were among the most sensitive 10th percentile of available data for all 4 metals, refuting older literature placing mayflies in the insensitive portion of metal SSDs. Testing translocated aquatic insect communities in 30-d artificial streams is an efficient approach to generate multiple species effect values under quasi-natural conditions that are relevant to natural streams.

AB Plant protection products (PPPs) undergo rigorous regulatory assessment to ensure that they do not pose unacceptable risks to the environment. Elucidation of their fate and behavior in soil is an integral part of this environmental risk assessment. The active substance degradation in soil of PPPs is first assessed in laboratory studies (typically following Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] test guideline 307). Conditions in guideline laboratory studies are far removed from those occurring under agricultural use, and the contribution of crop roots has currently not been assessed. We integrated viable plant root systems, representative of 3 different crop types, into the OECD test guideline 307 design to assess their impact on the dissipation of the herbicide prometryn. Significantly faster decline of parent residue and higher formation of nonextractable residues were observed in all 3 planted systems. This led to a reduction in the time required for 50% of the compound to dissipate (DT50) of approximately one-half in the presence of rye grass and hot pepper and of approximately one-third in the presence of red clover. These findings imply that plants and their associated root networks can have a significant influence on PPP dissipation. Based on these data, greater environmental realism could be added to the standardized laboratory study design by the inclusion of plant root systems into higher tier studies, which, in turn, could serve to improve the environmental risk assessment process.

AB Tissue distributions and body-size dependent and species-specific bioaccumulation of 12 organic ultraviolet absorbents (UVAs) were investigated in 9 species of wildlife freshwater fish from the Pearl River catchment, South China. The concentrations of the 12 UVAs were from 109 to 2320 ng/g lipid weight in the fish tissue samples. The UVAs 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (BP-3), octocrylene (OCR), UV531, and 5 benzotriazole UV stabilizers (UVP, UV329, UV234, UV328, and UV327) were detected in more than half of the fish tissue samples. The UVA UV531 showed an obvious potential for bioaccumulation in the wild freshwater fish, with an estimated bioaccumulation factor (log BAF) and a biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) of 4.54 +/- 0.55 and 4.88 +/- 6.78, respectively. Generally, liver (989 +/- 464 ng/g lipid wt) contained the highest level of UVAs, followed in decreasing order by belly fat (599 +/- 318 ng/g lipid wt), swimming bladder (494 +/- 282 ng/g lipid wt), dorsal muscle (470 +/- 240 ng/g lipid wt), and egg (442 +/- 238 ng/g lipid wt). The bioaccumulation of UVAs in the freshwater wild fish was species specific and compound dependent. Bottom-dwelling detritus-ingesting omnivorous fish contained obviously higher UVA concentrations, suggesting that detritus/sediment ingestion is a significant pathway for exposure of the wild freshwater fish to the UVAs. The UVAs UV531 and BP-3 demonstrated a potential for growth dilution. Metabolism might play a significant role in elimination of the UVAs in the fish tissues, with the highest rate of metabolism in the liver. The UVAs did not demonstrate obvious trophic magnification in the freshwater ecosystem of the Pearl River catchment. More research is warranted to elucidate maternal transfer of the UVAs.

AB Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) are included in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) priority list of engineered nanomaterials for assessment of their environmental impact. The present study was carried out to assess the CeO2 NP toxicity to the freshwater midge Chironomus riparius larvae at concentrations of 2.5, 25, 250, and 2500 mg of CeO2 NP/kg of sediment. Experiments were designed to assess the prolonged exposure of midges to CeO2 NPs while adhering to OECD test guideline 218. The following parameters were investigated: CeO2 NP uptake by larvae, oxidative stress parameters, in vivo genotoxic effects, and life trait parameters. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analysis showed a significant positive correlation between the concentration of CeO2 NPs in the sediment and its uptake by the larvae. No significant mortality was observed in C. riparius, and oxidative stress was not detected. The only significantly induced sublethal effect was genotoxicity, which began to manifest at a lowest-observed-effect concentration of 25 mg kg(-1) of sediment and progressively increased at higher concentrations. Our results indicate that exposure to CeO2 NP-contaminated freshwater sediments does not pose a risk to chironomids at environmentally realistic concentrations. However, the significant accumulation of CeO2 NPs by chironomid larvae may pose a risk through trophic transfer to organisms further up the food chain. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;39:131-140.

AB Melanophores are pigmented cells that change the distribution of melanosomes, enabling animals to appear lighter or darker for camouflage, thermoregulation, and protection from ultraviolet radiation. A complex series of hormonal and neural mechanisms regulates melanophore pigment distribution, making these dynamic cells a valuable tool to screen toxicants as they rapidly respond to changes in the environment. We found that maltol, a naturally occurring flavor enhancer and fragrance agent, induces melanophore pigment aggregation in a dose-dependent manner in Xenopus laevis tadpoles. To determine if maltol affects camouflage adaptation, we placed tadpoles into maltol baths situated over either a white or a black background. Maltol induced pigment aggregation in a similar dose-dependent pattern regardless of background color. We also tested how maltol treatment compares to melatonin treatment and found that the degree of pigment aggregation induced by maltol is similar to treatment with melatonin but that maltol induces over a much longer time course. Last, maltol had no effect on mRNA expression in the brain of genes that regulate camouflage-related pigment aggregation. The present results suggest that maltol does not exert its effects via the camouflage adaptation mechanism or via melatonin-related mechanisms. These results are the first to identify a putative toxicological effect of maltol exposure in vivo and rule out several mechanisms by which maltol may exert its effects on pigment aggregation.

AB To estimate the risk of metal (Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd) exposure of tree sparrows through food at different life stages (including nestling, juvenile, adult in summer, and adult in winter), metal daily intake (MDI), metal daily intake per unit of body weight (MDIBW), and exposure risks (hazard quotient and hazard index) of tree sparrows at different life stages from a polluted area, Baiyin, and a control area, Liujiaxia, were assessed. Metal daily intakes and MDI(BW)s of tree sparrows from Baiyin were higher than those from Liujiaxia, which can be attributed to higher metal concentrations of food sources in Baiyin than those in Liujiaxia. Metal daily intakes and MDI(BW)s of nestlings were higher than those of adults and juveniles. This difference is observed probably because nonphytophagous invertebrates, the predominant food fed to nestlings, possessed the highest metal concentrations. In addition, adults in summer had higher MDIs and MDI(BW)s than juveniles and adults in winter. This finding is probably observed because juveniles and adults in winter consumed a higher proportion of maize, which had the lowest metal concentrations. In addition, the biomagnification of 4 metals through the food chain increased the health risks of tree sparrows. Exposure risks of tree sparrows to metals were comparable to those of waterfowl and raptors, even when soil metals were below threshold. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2785-2796. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Manufactured nanomaterial production is outpacing the ability to investigate environmental hazard using current regulatory paradigms, causing a backlog of materials requiring testing. To ameliorate this issue, regulatory bodies have proposed integrating safety into the production of novel nanomaterials, allowing for hazards to be identified early in development rather than aftermarket release. In addition, there is a growing interest in short-term ecotoxicity testing to rapidly identify environmental hazards. In this sense, the present study investigated 3 carbon nanofibers (CNFs), created with different production methods, using short-term in vitro and in vivo exposures on fish cell lines, mussel hemocytes, crustacea, and algae. The present study investigated if differences in ecotoxicity hazard between the CNFs could be identified and, if so, which product could be considered less hazardous. A major challenge in assessing the potential hazards posed by manufactured nanomaterials is standardizing the preparation for testing. Standardized operating protocols have been proposed using protein to facilitate the preparation of stable stock suspension, which is not environmentally representative. As such, the study also assessed the potential impacts these standardized protocols (with or without the use of protein) could have on the interpretation of environmental hazard. The results demonstrated that there were clear differences between the 3 CNFs and that the dispersion protocol influenced the interpretation of hazard, demonstrating a need for caution when interpreting ecotoxicity in a regulatory context.

AB Limited species diversity in aquatic toxicity data for most current-use dispersants leads to uncertainties in hazard assessments, which impacts the broader discussion on dispersant use. Sufficient toxicity data are available for a re-evaluation of previously developed dispersant-interspecies correlation estimation (ICE) models. These models increase species diversity because toxicity predictions for untested species are made from the known toxicity for surrogates. Data were used to refine 4 and develop 25 new dispersant-ICE models. Most of the new models are for species not included in the >2000 existing ICE models, and contain a higher species diversity than the original dispersant-ICE models (19 vs 7 species). Dispersant-ICE models predict toxicity with reasonably accuracy: predictions were within 3-fold of observed values (new models: 70% of 132 predictions; refined models: 88% of 83 predictions), and species sensitivity distributions developed with ICE-predicted data only were in most cases not statistically significantly different from those developed with empirical data (83% of 23 paired comparisons). Examples of the practical application of dispersant-ICE models, including laboratory-to-field comparisons within the context of operational dispersant application rates, are also presented. The significance of these results is that dispersant-ICE models could fill gaps in species diversity, and thus help to address concerns about species sensitivities related to the use of dispersants.

AB Two releases from steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) wellheads occurred 3 yr apart. To track recovery of the affected areas, red-backed voles were studied 1 and 4 yr later, using population estimates, hepatic detoxification effort, body condition, and tissue metal levels as bioindicators of site recovery. From years 1 to 4, higher ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase induction was no longer evident, capture rate was lower, and body lead residues were no longer (inversely) correlated with body condition.

AB The impacts of microplastics on aquatic ecosystems and biota are gaining attention globally. Although microplastics have been widely detected in biota, there currently are few standardized detection and identification methods. The present study developed a novel one-step digestion method which was evaluated with mussel and fish samples. This method employed nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide (HNO3:H2O2 = 4:1 by volume) as digestion reagents, which completely digested biota samples <5 g weight within 30 min at 50 degrees C. A density separation step was subsequently used to remove organic residues as necessary. The efficiency and suitability of this method were tested by spiking microplastics of 7 different types and of various sizes (1000, 900, 675, 300, 250, and 150 mu m) into mussel and gastrointestinal tracts of fish. The recoveries of microplastics ranged from 90 to 100%. No significant changes in weight, surface area, and particle size (t test, p > 0.05) were observed for all tested polymers. Fourier transform infrared spectral analyses demonstrated that the method did not degrade any of the polymers except for polyethylene terephthalate. The method was demonstrated with mussel and fish samples collected from the Pearl River delta, south China, and was able to recover microplastics effectively. Overall, the present method is time-saving and easy to operate, with low procedural cross-contamination. The properties of microplastics recovered by the present method remained largely intact, greatly benefiting subsequent qualitative and quantitative analyses. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1400-1408.

AB Lake ecosystems are threatened by an array of stressors. An understanding of how food webs and bioaccumulation dynamics respond to these challenges requires the quantification of energy flow. We present a combined, multitracer approach using both polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and stable isotopes to trace energy flow, and to quantify how lake trout feeding strategies have adapted to changes in food web structure in 3 basins of Lake Huron (ON, Canada). This combined tracer approach allows the quantification of dietary proportions (using stable isotopes), which are then integrated using a novel PCB tracer approach that employs knowledge of PCB bioaccumulation pathways, to estimate consumption and quantify energy flow between age cohorts of individual fish across Lake Huron. We observed basin-specific differences in ultimate energy sources for lake trout, with Georgian Bay lake trout deriving almost 70% of their energy from benthic resources compared with 16 and 33% for Main Basin and North Channel lake trout, respectively. These differences in resource utilization are further magnified when they are contrasted with age. The dependency on pelagic energy sources in the Main Basin and North Channel suggests that these populations will be the most negatively affected by the ongoing trophic collapse in Lake Huron. Our study demonstrates the utility of a multitracer approach to quantify the consequences of food web adaptations to changes in aquatic ecosystems. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1245-1255.

AB Climbazole is an antifungal active ingredient used in personal care products. After application this chemical reaches the aquatic environment and may pose a risk to fish. In the present study, we measured the transcriptional effects of essential genes related to a wide range of signaling pathways on zebrafish eleutheroembryos exposed to climbazole at environmentally relevant and predicted worst-case environmental concentrations, and explored the potential biomarkers via partial least squares discriminant analysis. Transcription analysis covering up to 73 genes revealed significant down-regulation of circadian rhythm- and steroidogenesis-related genes in zebrafish embryos and larvae after exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of climbazole. This topical antifungal agent also modulated the transcripts of genes involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, oocyte maturation, and sexual differentiation at predicted worst-case environmental concentrations. In addition, mpr alpha, igf3, nr1d1, nr1d2b, cyp19a1a, vtg1, il-1 beta, and il-8 were chosen as potential biomarkers in embryonic zebrafish following exposure to climbazole. These findings can help us understand the remarkable transcriptional response to climbazole in the early life stage of zebrafish. Future research should elucidate whether the transcriptional modulation translates into metabolic phenotypes associated with the corresponding signaling pathways.

AB Ecosystem quality is an important area of protection in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). Chemical pollution has adverse impacts on ecosystems on a global scale. To improve methods for assessing ecosystem impacts, the Life Cycle Initiative hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme established a task force to evaluate the state-of-the-science in modeling chemical exposure of organisms and the resulting ecotoxicological effects for use in LCIA. The outcome of the task force work will be global guidance and harmonization by recommending changes to the existing practice of exposure and effect modeling in ecotoxicity characterization. These changes will reflect the current science and ensure the stability of recommended practice. Recommendations must work within the needs of LCIA in terms of 1) operating on information from any inventory reporting chemical emissions with limited spatiotemporal information, 2) applying best estimates rather than conservative assumptions to ensure unbiased comparison with results for other impact categories, and 3) yielding results that are additive across substances and life cycle stages and that will allow a quantitative expression of damage to the exposed ecosystem. We describe the current framework and discuss research questions identified in a roadmap. Primary research questions relate to the approach toward ecotoxicological effect assessment, the need to clarify the method's scope and interpretation of its results, the need to consider additional environmental compartments and impact pathways, and the relevance of effect metrics other than the currently applied geometric mean of toxicity effect data across species. Because they often dominate ecotoxicity results in LCIA, we give metals a special focus, including consideration of their possible essentiality and changes in environmental bioavailability. We conclude with a summary of key questions along with preliminary recommendations to address them as well as open questions that require additional research efforts.

AB As the number of chemicals developed and used by industry increases, the inherent limitations of traditional toxicology approaches become an unavoidable issue. To help meet the demand for toxicity evaluation, new methods, such as high-throughput toxicity screening, are currently being developed to permit rapid determination of toxic, molecular, and/or biochemical effects of a wide range of chemicals. In the present study, we demonstrate the utility of an avian in vitro toxicogenomics screening approach to determine the cytotoxic and transcriptomic effects of 10 organic flame retardants (OFRs) currently of international priority for ecological risk evaluation to prioritize and inform future toxicological studies. Hepatocytes from 2 avian species, chicken and double-crested cormorant, were prepared and exposed for 24 h to various concentrations (0-300 mu M) of the following 10 OFRs: Chemical s Service registration numbers 29761-21-5, 56803-37-3 (p-tert-butylphenyl diphenyl phosphate [BPDP]), 65652-41-7, 68937-41-7 (phenol, isopropylated, phosphate [3:1] [IPPP]), 95906-11-9, 19186-97-1, 26040-51-7, 35948-25-5, 21850-44-2, and 25713-60-4. Cell viability, the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase assay, and transcriptomic analysis using species-specific ToxChip polymerase chain reaction arrays were performed to evaluate the in vitro effect of these OFRs. Of the 10 OFRs assessed, BPDP and IPPP elicited the strongest cytotoxic and transcriptomic responses in both chicken and double-crested cormorant hepatocytes and are therefore recommended as priority candidates for further wildlife toxicological investigations.

AB The toxicity of some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) increases with ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The intensity of UV radiation varies within aquatic ecosystems, potentially providing reprieves during which tissue repair may occur. Transient/short-term PAH exposure prior to UV exposure may initiate metabolism/clearance, potentially affecting outcomes. Larval Sciaenops ocellatus were exposed to oil and UV radiation, using either variable photoperiods or pre-UV oil exposure durations. Shorter PAH exposures exhibited greater toxicity, as did exposure to shorter photoperiods. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2372-2379. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Bayesian methods and frequentist confidence intervals are proposed as an alternative approach in ecotoxicology, emphasizing effect sizes and associated (un)certainties to judge the biological relevance of effects instead of basing decisions on p values. These approaches show advantages over null hypothesis significance testing. In particular, Bayesian methods revealed more potential than frequentist counterparts, as the posterior distribution and its credible intervals can be directly interpreted as the probability of effect sizes.

AB One application of nanocopper is as a wood-preserving pesticide in pressure-treated lumber. Recent research has shown that pressure-treated lumber amended with micronized copper azole (MCA), which contains nanosized copper, releases copper under estuarine and marine conditions. The form of copper released (i.e., ionic, nanocopper [1-100nm in size]) is not fully understood but will affect the bioavailability and toxicity of the metal. In the present study, multiple lines of evidence, including size fractionation, ion-selective electrode electrochemistry, comparative toxicity, and copper speciation were used to determine the form of copper released from lumber blocks and sawdust. The results of all lines of evidence supported the hypothesis that ionic copper was released from MCA lumber and sawdust, with little evidence that nanocopper was released. For example, copper concentrations in size fractionations of lumber block aqueous leachates including unfiltered, 0.1m, and 3kDa were not significantly different, suggesting that the form of copper released was in the size range operationally defined as dissolved. These results correlated with the ion-selective electrode data which detects only ionic copper. In addition, comparative toxicity testing resulted in a narrow range of median lethal concentrations (221-257g/L) for MCA lumber blocks and CuSO4. We conclude that ionic copper was released from the nanocopper pressure-treated lumber under estuarine and marine conditions. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:1969-1979.

AB Over the last century, unexploded ordnances have been disposed of in marine shelf systems because of a lack of cost-effective alternatives. Underwater unexploded ordnances have the potential to leak 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), commonly used chemical munitions, and contaminate local waters, biota, and sediments. The rate at which this contamination occurs in the environment is relatively unknown, and the cost- and time-prohibitive nature of sampling across sites makes mapping difficult. In the present study we assessed the efficacy of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) for sampling relatively soluble munitions compounds over a range of environmental conditions (i.e., changes in temperature and salinity) and optimized the composition of the passive sampling polymer. The EVA sampler was able to successfully detect ambient concentrations of lingering munitions compounds from field sites containing unexploded ordnances. The sampler affinity for the munitions in terms of an EVA-water partition coefficient was greater than the standard octanol water values for each target compound. Partitioning of compounds onto EVA over the natural ranges of salinity did not change significantly, although uptake varied consistently and predictably with temperature. Increasing the vinyl acetate to ethylene ratio of the polymer corresponded to an increase in uptake capacity, consistent with enhanced dipole-dipole interactions between the munitions and the polymer. This sampler provides a cost-effective means to map and track leakage of unexploded ordnances both spatially and temporally. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:1990-1997. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are efficiently converted during the wastewater-treatment process into sparingly soluble Ag sulfides (Ag2S). In several countries, sewage sludge is used as a fertilizer in agriculture. The bioavailability of sulfidized Ag to the terrestrial isopod Porcellio scaber was investigated. Sewage sludge containing transformed AgNPs was obtained from a laboratory-scale sewage-treatment plant operated according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline 303a. The results of transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray of sludge samples suggest that AgNPs were completely transformed to Ag2S. Adult isopods were exposed to OECD 207 soil substrate amended with the AgNP spiked sludge for 14 d (uptake phase) followed by an elimination phase in unspiked soil of equal duration. Most of the Ag measured in P. scaber at the end of the uptake phase was found in the hindgut (71%), indicating that only a minor part of the estimated Ag content was actually assimilated by the isopods with 16.3 and 12.7% found in the carcass and hepatopancreas, respectively. As a result of this, the Ag content of the animals dropped following transition to unspiked sludge within 2 d to one-third of the previously measured Ag concentration and remained stable at this level until the end of the elimination period. The present study shows that Ag2S in sewage sludge is bioavailable to the terrestrial isopod P. scaber. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:1606-1613. (c) 2018 The Authors.

AB The present study assessed cadmium uptake and depuration rates in the euryhaline estuarine shrimp Palaemon varians under different exposure routes. Postlarval shrimp were exposed for 4 d under different exposure routes: contaminated water, contaminated diet, and a 2-way exposure scenario where both contaminated water and diet were used. After exposure, postlarval shrimp were transferred to a clean medium and fed a noncontaminated diet for 96h. Bioaccumulation via the different exposure routes was modeled with a standard first-order, one-compartment toxicokinetics model and one with an additional parameter reflecting an inert fraction or storage compartment. The simultaneous 2-way exposure (through water and diet) resulted in accumulation being almost twice as high as the sum of the individual exposure routes, thus indicating that accumulation from multiple routes may be more than additive. Cadmium uptake from water was faster than uptake from food maintained for 48h at that same cadmium concentration. Shrimp were unable to eliminate cadmium from their body, showing no depuration during 96h after exposure via different routes, thus suggesting that a longer depuration period is needed. Model comparisons did not provide a significantly better fit when the model included the presence of an inert fraction. The present study highlights the importance of assessing accumulation using multiple exposure routes compared with individual routes because the latter may underestimate bioaccumulation.

AB Extrapolating from organism-level endpoints, as generated from standard pesticide toxicity tests, to populations is an important step in threatened and endangered species risk assessments. We apply a population model for a threatened herbaceous plant species, Boltonia decurrens, to estimate the potential population-level impacts of 3 herbicides. We combine conservative exposure scenarios with dose-response relationships for growth and survival of standard test species and apply those in the species-specific model. Exposure profiles applied in the B. decurrens model were estimated using exposure modeling approaches. Spray buffer zones were simulated by using corresponding exposure profiles, and their effectiveness at mitigating simulated effects on the plant populations was assessed with the model. From simulated exposure effects scenarios that affect plant populations, the present results suggest that B. decurrens populations may be more sensitive to exposures from herbicide spray drift affecting vegetative stages than from runoff affecting early seedling survival and growth. Spray application buffer zones were shown to be effective at reducing effects on simulated populations. Our case study demonstrates how species-specific population models can be applied in pesticide risk assessment to bring organism-level endpoints, exposure assumptions, and species characteristics together in an ecologically relevant context.

AB Nanopesticides are novel plant protection products offering numerous benefits. Because nanoparticles behave differently from dissolved chemicals, the environmental risks of these materials could differ from conventional pesticides. We used soil-earthworm systems to compare the fate and uptake of analytical-grade bifenthrin to that of bifenthrin in traditional and nanoencapsulated formulations. Apparent sorption coefficients for bifenthrin were up to 3.8 times lower in the nano treatments than in the non-nano treatments, whereas dissipation half-lives of the nano treatments were up to 2 times longer. Earthworms in the nano treatments accumulated approximately 50% more bifenthrin than those in the non-nano treatments. In the non-nano treatments, most of the accumulated material was found in the earthworm tissue, whereas in the nano treatments, the majority resided in the gut. Evaluation of toxicokinetic modeling approaches showed that models incorporating the release rate of bifenthrin from the nanocapsule and distribution within the earthworm provided the best estimations of uptake from the nano-formulations. Overall, our findings indicate that the risks of nanopesticides may be different from those of conventional formulations. The modeling presented provides a starting point for assessing risks of these materials but needs to be further developed to better consider the behavior of the nanoencapsulated pesticide within the gut system.

AB In metal toxicity model studies of soil-plant systems, hydroponic culture is often employed to simulate soil conditions, but the validity of this approach has not been examined. The present study evaluated Ni toxicity to wheat root elongation using models developed in hydroponic and sand cultures and then compared the results with those obtained from real soils. Three mechanism toxicity models were examined: the free ion activity model, the biotic ligand model (BLM), and the Gouy-Chapman-Stern model. After being developed in hydroponic and sand culture bioassays, the models were validated with 18 soils from across China. The results showed that more accurate predictions were obtained with sand rather than hydroponic bioassays. Dissolved organic matter exerted only a limited effect on Ni toxicity, whereas an important role was found for osmotic effects. Of the 3 models, the sand-based BLM best predicted Ni toxicity to wheat root elongation (root-mean-square error = 16.2% and R-2 = 0.79) and was as good as the BLM estimated directly from soils. The present study shows that sand is a better matrix than solution for root elongation bioassays of Ni toxicity and that osmotic effects must be taken into account in evaluating soil conditions.

AB Potential toxic effects of thiamethoxam on nontarget organisms and the community structure of a generic Midwestern farm pond and emergent wetland were assessed using 2 versions of the comprehensive aquatic system model: CASM(GFP), a generic farm pond model, and CASM(GWL), a generic wetland model. The CASM(GFP) and CASM(GWL) are integrated bioenergetics-based and habitat quality models that describe the daily biomass values of selected producer and consumer populations representative of generalized Midwestern farm ponds and emergent wetlands. The CASM(GFP) demonstrated the ability to reproduce values of population biomass reported for Midwestern (and other) pond ecosystems; the CASM(GWL) provided a similar modeling capability for Midwestern emergent wetlands. Lethal and sublethal effects of thiamethoxam were modeled as extrapolations of laboratory toxicity assays using the CASM(GFP) and the CASM(GWL). Time series of daily environmental concentrations of thiamethoxam constructed for 6 regional pesticide applications across the United States failed to produce any calculated impacts on modeled population biomass or changes in community structure of modeled trophic guilds in the CASM(GFP) or the CASM(GWL). However, evaluation of systematically increased daily concentrations demonstrated the ability of both models to simulate direct and indirect toxic effects of this pesticide. The present model study suggests that process-based food web/ecosystem models can be used to characterize the potential ecological effects of thiamethoxam on generalized farm pond and emergent wetland ecosystems.

AB When oil spills occur, behavior is the first line of defense for a fish to avoid being contaminated. We determined the avoidance threshold of the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) to the water-soluble fraction (WSF) of oil using a dual-flow choice box. The results showed that a plume of 20%-diluted WSF (total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon [PAH] concentration: 8.54gL(-1)) triggered a significant avoidance response that was detected within 7.5min of introducing WSF-contaminated water into the experimental setup. However, the ecological relevance of seabass capacity to detect and avoid WSF remains to be established. In the short term, such a response is indeed liable to reduce seabass contact time with oil-contaminated water and thus preserve their functional integrity. In the long term, however, avoidance may contribute to the displacement of a population into a possibly less auspicious environment, with consequences very similar to those of contaminant exposure, that is, disturbed population dynamics and demography.

AB We aimed to evaluate the effects of environmental doses of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on bioconcentration and gene expression in common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Adult male and female carp were exposed to environmental (200ng/L) and experimental (2mg/L) doses of PFOA for 56 d. Carp exposed to 200ng/L had levels of PFOA below the level of detection in all tissue samples analyzed, whereas variable concentrations were measurable in various tissues from carp exposed to 2mg/L. The expression level of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene, coding for a detoxifying enzyme, increased in a PFOA dose-dependent manner in liver tissues from 200ng/L to 2mg/L exposure (p<0.05). The expression levels of CYP19A gene, coding for the enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen, were altered in gonadal tissues from male and female carp exposed to either 200ng/L or 2mg/L; expression increased in male gonads and decreased in female gonads. Unexpectedly, the expression levels of CYP19A in male and female gonads from carp exposed to 200ng/L or 2mg/L were similar (p>0.05). Therefore, even though environmental doses of PFOA did not accumulate in tissues of the common carp, they did affect the gene expression levels of GST in the liver and CYP19A in the gonads. These observations raise concerns that exposure to environmental doses of PFOA may affect gene expression in animals and possibly in humans, with important health consequences.

AB To evaluate health effects associated with consumption of fish contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from the upper Hudson River, farm-raised mink were fed diets containing fish collected from the river. Endpoints assessed included adult reproductive performance, offspring growth and mortality, and organ mass and pathology of adults and their offspring. Scat samples were collected from adult males at the time of necropsy and from adult females just prior to whelping. Scat samples were analyzed for PCBs, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). The present study provides the results of these analyses and compares Sigma PCB and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations in scat with dietary and hepatic concentrations associated with effects reported previously. Dry weight concentrations of Sigma PCBs and Sigma TEQs in scat generally increased with dietary concentration and reflected corresponding increases in hepatic concentrations of Sigma PCBs and Sigma TEQs. Maternal concentrations of Sigma PCBs in scat expressed on a dry, wet, and lipid weight basis predicted to result in 50% kit mortality (LC50) were 1.0, 0.30, and 12 mu g Sigma PCBs/g. Concentrations of Sigma PCBs in scat expressed on a dry, wet, and lipid weight basis predicted to result in 50% incidence of a previously reported jaw lesion (EC50) were 1.7, 0.48, and 24 mu g Sigma PCBs/g in adult females and 2.5, 0.87, and 19 mu g Sigma PCBs/g in adult males.

Briefly, 3 generations of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) are exposed to a chemical over a 20-wk period: 3 wk in the parental generation (F0), 15 wk in the first generation (F1), and 2 wk in the second generation (F2). The present study reports the first MEOGRT results concerning branched isomer mixtures of 4-nonylphenol (NP). Adult F0 medaka exposed to NP at 5 actual concentrations (1.27, 2.95, 9.81, 27.8, 89.4 mu g/L) were unaffected in terms of reproduction, although vitellogenin in the male liver was increased dose-dependently at concentration of 2.95 mu g/L and higher. In F1, in contrast, total egg (fecundity), fertile egg, and fertility decreased as NP increased; lowest-observed-effect concentrations (LOECs) for total egg, fertile egg, and fertility were 1.27, 1.27, 27.8 mu g/L, respectively. In F1, but not in F0, secondary sex characteristics (i.e., anal fin papillae in males) were suppressed at 27.8 mu g/L NP. Vitellogenin induction in adult male fish was slightly weaker in F1 than it was in F0, however. Gonadal sex abnormality and sex reversal occurred at 27.8 and 89.4 mu g/L NP in F1 subadults. At 89.4 mu g/L NP, all genotypic F1 males in breeding pairs had female phenotype, and some even demonstrated spawning. Concentrations of NP lower than 89.4 mu g/L did not affect F2 survival or hatching. The highest detected NP level in environmental freshwater in Japan was approximately a half of the LOEC (1.27 mu g/L for F1 fecundity); in other countries, however, environmental concentrations above the LOEC are reported, suggesting that NP may be affecting fish populations.

AB Evaluations of sediment quality conditions are commonly conducted using whole-sediment chemistry analyses but can be enhanced by evaluating multiple lines of evidence, including measures of the bioavailable forms of contaminants. In particular, porewater chemistry data provide information that is directly relevant for interpreting sediment toxicity data. Various methods for sampling porewater for trace metals and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which is an important moderator of metal bioavailability, have been employed. The present study compares the peeper, push point, centrifugation, and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) methods for the quantification of 6 metals and DOC. The methods were evaluated at low and high concentrations of metals in 3 sediments having different concentrations of total organic carbon and acid volatile sulfide and different particle-size distributions. At low metal concentrations, centrifugation and push point sampling resulted in up to 100 times higher concentrations of metals and DOC in porewater compared with peepers and DGTs. At elevated metal levels, the measured concentrations were in better agreement among the 4 sampling techniques. The results indicate that there can be marked differences among operationally different porewater sampling methods, and it is unclear if there is a definitive best method for sampling metals and DOC in porewater.

AB Impacts of polyvinylpyrrolidine-coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on root gravitropism in Arabidopsis thaliana were investigated at the physiological, cellular, and molecular levels. Our results showed that AgNPs were taken up by the root and primarily localized at the cell wall and intercellular spaces. Root gravitropism was inhibited by exposure to AgNPs, and the inhibition in root gravitropism caused by exposure to AgNPs exhibited a dose-response relationship. Auxin accumulation was reduced in the root tips because of exposure to AgNPs. However, increased indole-3-acetic acid level could not rescue the inhibition of root gravitropism. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed significant downregulation of expression of auxin receptor-related genes, which is the TIR1/AFB family of F-box proteins including AFB1, AFB2, AFB3, AFB5, and TIR1. Therefore, the present study suggests that AgNPs have toxicity to the model plant A. thaliana as shown by inhibition of root gravitropism along with a reduction in auxin accumulation and expression of auxin receptors.

AB The present study measured hepatic transcriptome responses in male rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum) exposed to 2 municipal wastewater-treatment plants (MWWTPs; Kitchener and Waterloo) over 4 fall seasons (2011-2014) in the Grand River (Ontario, Canada). The overall goal was to determine if upgrades at the Kitchener MWWTP (in 2012) resulted in transcriptome responses indicative of improved effluent quality. The number of differentially expressed probes in fish downstream of the Kitchener outfall (904-1223) remained comparable to that downstream of Waterloo (767-3867). Noteworthy was that year and the interaction of year and site explained variability in more than twice the number of transcripts than site alone, suggesting that year and the interaction of year and site had a greater effect on the transcriptome than site alone. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a gradual reduction in the number of gene ontologies over time at exposure sites, which corresponded with lower contaminant load. Subnetwork enrichment analysis revealed that there were noticeable shifts in the cell pathways differently expressed in the liver preupgrade and postupgrade. The dominant pathways altered preupgrade were related to genetic modifications and cell division, whereas postupgrade they were associated with the immune system, reproduction, and biochemical responses. Molecular pathways were dynamic over time, and following the upgrades, there was little evidence that gene expression profiles in fish collected from high-impact sites postupgrade were more similar to those in fish collected from reference site.

AB Propranolol is a human pharmaceutical beta-blocker that has been detected in municipal wastewater effluents at ng/L to low mg/L. To assess the potential of this compound to affect fish, fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) were exposed for a life cycle in a flow-through system to nominal propranolol concentrations of 0.87 ng/L, 8.7 ng/L, 87 ng/L, 870 ng/L, and 8700 ng/L. Measured propranolol concentrations were below detection for the 2 lowest exposure concentrations, and were 76 ng/L, 580 ng/L, and 7800 ng/L for the 3 highest exposure concentrations. During the 162-d to 165-d exposure, no significant changes in weights or lengths were seen in fathead minnows, although the highest concentration of propranolol did cause a 15% decrease in survival of larval and juvenile stage fish compared with controls. At maturity, there were no significant changes in condition factor, liver-somatic index, or secondary sex characteristics in propranolol-exposed male or female fish. Female gonadosomatic index was significantly decreased in fish exposed to the highest concentrations of propranolol, probably because of increased egg-laying. Fathead minnows from all propranolol exposures produced more eggs than control fish, with fish exposed to 7800 ng/L propranolol producing 70% more eggs per female (p = 0.060), and having significantly increased clutch size (p = 0.008). Egg quality, % fertilization, % hatching, and % deformities in F1 fry were unaffected by propranolol exposure of fish. Propranolol exposure caused no effects in fathead minnows, except at the highest exposure concentration (7800 ng/L), where there were slight decreases in survival of juvenile minnows, and indications of increased reproduction. The present study is important because it is the first to assess the potential for effects in fish exposed to propranolol for a life cycle. (C) 2016 SETAC

ID PREDICTION; IDENTIFICATION; CHEMICALS; RERIO
AB Given the numerous chemicals used in society, it is critical to develop tools for accurate and efficient evaluation of potential risks to human and ecological receptors. Fish embryo acute toxicity tests are 1 tool that has been shown to be highly predictive of standard, more resource-intensive, juvenile fish acute toxicity tests. However, there is also evidence that fish embryos are less sensitive than juvenile fish for certain types of chemicals, including neurotoxicants. The utility of fish embryos for pesticide hazard assessment was investigated by comparing published zebrafish embryo toxicity data from pesticides with median lethal concentration 50% (LC50) data for juveniles of 3 commonly tested fish species: rainbow trout, bluegill sunfish, and sheepshead minnow. A poor, albeit significant, relationship ( r(2) = 0.28; p< 0.05) was found between zebrafish embryo and juvenile fish toxicity when pesticides were considered as a single group, but a much better relationship ( r(2) - 0.64; p< 0.05) when pesticide mode of action was factored into an analysis of covariance. This discrepancy is partly explained by the large number of neurotoxic pesticides in the dataset, supporting previous findings that commonly used fish embryo toxicity test endpoints are particularly insensitive to neurotoxicants. These results indicate that it is still premature to replace juvenile fish toxicity tests with embryo-based tests such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity Test for routine pesticide hazard assessment, although embryo testing could be used with other screening tools for testing prioritization.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known to exhibit photo-induced toxicity. Hundreds to thousands of PAH parent and substituted compounds are found in the environment, and developing a predictive model applicable to a wide variety of PAHs and organisms is a necessary precursor to environmental risk assessments. There has been evolutionary progress in phototoxicity modeling since 1977. In the present study, a comprehensive review of the models developed to predict phototoxicity of PAHs is presented. The contributions of each of the models to the state of the art are discussed. The models are compared in terms of their scope of applicability to different organisms, PAHs, endpoints (median lethal time and median lethal concentration), and light conditions. The current state of the science that accounts for the key elements of phototoxicity modeling, including the differences in species sensitivity, the partitioning of PAHs into the target lipid of the organisms, and light absorption by the chemicals, as well as light exposure time and conditions, is discussed. In addition, the remaining issues that need to be addressed are explored: the effect of time-varying exposures to light and PAH concentrations, and the lack of a mechanistic understanding that can explain the failure of the Bunsen-Roscoe law of reciprocity.

AB Synovex (R) ONE is an extended-release implant containing the active ingredients estradiol benzoate and trenbolone acetate for use in beef steers and heifers. Trenbolone acetate is rapidly hydrolyzed in cattle to form 17 beta-trenbolone and its isomer, 17 alpha-trenbolone, which are further transformed to a secondary metabolite, trendione. As part of the environmental assessment for the use of Synovex ONE, data were generated to characterize the fate of 17 alpha-trenbolone, which is the principal metabolite found in cattle excreta, in the environment. A study was conducted to determine the degradation and transformation of [C-14]-17 alpha-trenbolone in 2 representative water-sediment systems under aerobic conditions. The same transformation products, 17b-trenbolone and trendione, were formed, principally in the sediment phase, in both systems. From the production of these transformation products, the 50% disappearance time (DT50) values of 17 beta-trenbolone and trendione were determined, along with the DT50 values of the parent compound and the total drug (17 alpha-trenbolone+17 beta-trenbolone+trendione). The DT50 values for the total system (aqueous and sediment phase) and for the total residues (17 alpha-trenbolone+17 beta-trenbolone+trendione) in the 2 systems were 34.7 d and 53.3 d, respectively.

AB Freshwater mussels, one of the most imperiled groups of animals in the world, are generally underrepresented in toxicity databases used for the development of ambient water quality criteria and other environmental guidance values. Acute 96-h toxicity tests were conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of 5 species of juvenile mussels from 2 families and 4 tribes to 10 chemicals (ammonia, metals, major ions, and organic compounds) and to screen 10 additional chemicals (mainly organic compounds) with a commonly tested mussel species, fatmucket (Lampsilis siliquoidea). In the multi-species study, median effect concentrations (EC50s) among the 5 species differed by a factor of <= 2 for chloride, potassium, sulfate, and zinc; a factor of <= 5 for ammonia, chromium, copper, and nickel; and factors of 6 and 12 for metolachlor and alachlor, respectively, indicating that mussels representing different families or tribes had similar sensitivity to most of the tested chemicals, regardless of modes of action. There was a strong linear relationship between EC50s for fatmucket and the other 4 mussel species across the 10 chemicals (r(2) = 0.97, slope close to 1.0), indicating that fatmucket was similar to other mussel species; thus, this commonly tested species can be a good surrogate for protecting other mussels in acute exposures. The sensitivity of juvenile fatmucket among different populations or cultured fromlarvae ofwild adults and captive-cultured adults was also similar in acute exposures to copper or chloride, indicating captive-cultured adult mussels can reliably be used to reproduce juveniles for toxicity testing. In compiled databases for all freshwater species, 1 or more mussel species were among the 4 most sensitive species for alachlor, ammonia, chloride, potassium, sulfate, copper, nickel, and zinc; therefore, the development of water quality criteria and other environmental guidance values for these chemicals should reflect the sensitivity of mussels. In contrast, the EC50s of fatmucket tested in the single-species study were in the high percentiles (> 75th) of species sensitivity distributions for 6 of 7 organic chemicals, indicating mussels might be relatively insensitive to organic chemicals in acute exposures.

AB The present study explored short-term temporal variations in circulating concentrations of 3 legacy organochlorines with different physicochemical properties (polychlorinated biphenyl 153 [PCB-153], p,p-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE], and hexachlorobenzene [HCB]) in breeding kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) in a colony in Svalbard (78 degrees N), Norwegian Arctic. Concentrations were measured in blood of a large number (n=412-521 blood samples, depending on the data analyses) of prebreeding, incubating, and chick-rearing birds over a period of 5yr (2007-2011). The PCB-153 concentrations were equal in male and female blood in the prebreeding period, whereas females had significantly lower concentrations during incubation and chick rearing, probably because of their ability to eliminate organochlorines through egg laying. A similar temporal pattern was observed with DDE, although the lower concentrations in incubating females were not significant. Males and females had similar concentrations of HCB over all reproductive stages. The concentrations of all 3 compounds varied greatly between years. The concentrations of PCB-153 tended to decline over the study period, whereas concentrations of HCB showed an increasing trend, especially among chick-rearing males late in the season. Concentrations of PCB-153 increased approximately 2.5 times from the prebreeding to the chick-rearing period, concurrent with mobilization of body lipids (reduced body mass). A similar, but less pronounced trend was found for HCB. For DDE, however, kittiwakes had the highest concentrations in the prebreeding period, suggesting relatively high exposure in their winter areas. The present study documented large variations in circulating concentrations of legacy organochlorines among and within breeding seasons in kittiwakes, but the alterations within seasons were relatively consistent from year to year.

AB The present study investigated the toxicity of several emerging contaminants: the pharmaceutical drug carbamazepine (CBZ), the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA), and the herbicide atrazine (ATZ) in a marine bivalve. Green mussels (Perna viridis) were exposed to different concentrations of CBZ, BPA, and ATZ, either individually or as mixtures over a 7-d period, and a suite of molecular and cellular biomarkers were analyzed: biomarkers of immunotoxicity (total hemocyte count, phagocytosis, extracellular lysozyme), genotoxicity (Comet assay), neurotoxicity (inhibition of acetylcholinesterase [AChE]), endocrine disruption (vitellin-like proteins), and detoxification enzymes (cytochrome P4501A [CYP1A], 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase [EROD], and glutathione-S-transferase [GST]). Results of the single-chemical exposure tests highlighted the relatively low toxicity of CBZ because most biomarker responses observed were recorded at concentrations well above environmental levels. Bisphenol A exposure at environmentally realistic concentrations resulted in clear immunomodulatory, genotoxic, and endocrine-disruptive effects. Similarly, 3 of the 10 biomarkers tested on green mussels (genotoxicity, inhibition of AchE, and EROD) responded after exposure to ATZ at environmentally relevant doses or below, and confirmed the potency of this herbicide to marine bivalves. Exposure tests using mixtures of CBZ, BPA, and ATZ also revealed that these 3 substances were generally acting in an additive manner on the selected biomarkers, at environmental doses, with some exceptions (antagonism and/or synergy) at low and high concentrations. The present study also confirms that most of the biomarkers used are suitable for biomonitoring studies with green mussels. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:429-441. (c) 2016 SETAC

AB Ammonia is an important contaminant to consider in all toxicity tests. It is especially important to consider the impacts of ammonia in test methods that use sensitive water column organisms exposed to sediments or sediment extracts, such as porewater and elutriate toxicity tests. Embryo-larval development toxicity tests, such as the 48-h method using Mytilus mussel species, are particularly sensitive to ammonia. To better understand the effect thresholds across different life stages of these mussels, 6 short-term (48-h) development toxicity tests and 3 21-d toxicity tests with different-sized juvenile mussels were conducted. Two of the juvenile mussel tests involved 21-d continuous chronic exposure to ammonia, whereas the third involved an acute 2-d ammonia exposure, followed by a 19-d recovery period. The embryo-larval development test method (50% effect concentration [EC50]=0.14-0.18mg/L un-ionized ammonia) was 2.5 times more sensitive than the juvenile mussel 21-d survival endpoint (50% lethal concentration=0.39mg/L un-ionized ammonia) and 2 times more sensitive than the most sensitive sublethal juvenile mussel endpoint (EC50=0.26mg/L un-ionized ammonia). Further, it was found that the juveniles recovered from a 48-h exposure to un-ionized ammonia of up to 1.1mg/L. The data generated suggest that the embryo development endpoint was sufficiently sensitive to un-ionized ammonia to protect the chronically exposed (21d) juvenile mussels.

AB Tumor angiogenesis is the main target in cancer drug development. Discovery of antiangiogenic agents targeting different mechanisms of action is the major area of research to control tumor growth and metastasis. Zebrafish (in the embryo-larvae stage) acts as an essential preclinical efficacy-toxicity model for antiangiogenic drug discovery. We aimed to develop a carcinogen-induced model of proangiogenesis in zebrafish embryo-larvae using the carcinogens lindane and benzo[a]pyrene. Zebrafish were randomly selected for mating. Postspawning, healthy embryos were staged, dispensed in reverse-osmosis water in a 12-well plate, and incubated at 28.5 degrees C, wherein 24 h postfertilization they were exposed to sublethal concentrations of the carcinogens. Three days postexposure, embryos were stained with alkaline phosphatase, and the angiogenic basket was imaged using a bright-field microscope. The number of subintestinal vessels, their length from somite to the basket, and other proangiogenic parameters were measured and analyzed. The effective concentrations causing a 30% increase in subintestinal vessels for benzo[a]pyrene and lindane were 2.69 and 2.24 mu M, respectively, thus proving their proangiogenic potency. The carcinogen-induced model of proangiogenesis in zebrafish embryo-larvae can be used as an effective high-throughput screening tool to assess the proangiogenic potential of carcinogenic compounds and to screen antiangiogenic drugs for better therapeutic intervention.

AB Lead poisoning, mainly through incidental ingestion of lead ammunition in carcasses, is a threat to scavenging and predatory bird species worldwide. In Australia, shooting for animal control is widespread, and a range of native scavenging species are susceptible to lead exposure. However, the prevalence of lead exposure in Australia's scavenging and predatory birds is largely unknown. We evaluated the degree to which the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax fleayi), an endangered Australian raptor and facultative scavenger, showed evidence of lead exposure. We detected lead in 100% of femur and liver tissues of 109 eagle carcasses opportunistically collected throughout Tasmania between 1996 and 2018. Concentrations were elevated in 10% of 106 liver (>6 mg/kg dry wt) and 4% of 108 femur (>10 mg/kg dry wt) samples. We also detected lead in 96% of blood samples taken from 24 live nestlings, with 8% at elevated concentrations (>10 mu g/dL). Of the liver samples with elevated lead, 73% had lead(207/206) isotope ratios within the published range of lead-based bullets available in Tasmania. These first comprehensive data on lead exposure of an Australian raptor are comparable to those for raptor studies elsewhere that identify lead-based ammunition exposure as a conservation threat. Our findings highlight the importance of further research and efforts to address lead contamination throughout the Tasmanian ecosystem and in other Australian regions.

AB Life-history traits determine individual fitness and the fate of populations. Imidacloprid, a widely used neonicotinoid insecticide, which persists in soil for more than 100 d at biologically relevant levels, may affect nontarget and ecologically important species, such as collembolans. In the present study, we determined the sublethal effects of short-term imidacloprid exposure and postexposure recovery in the collembolan Folsomia quadrioculata, which occurs abundantly across the northern hemisphere. We assessed survival, egg production, and hatching success in adult springtails exposed for 14 d through the diet to imidacloprid, followed by a 28-d postexposure phase. Survival and hatching success were high throughout the experiment in all the treatments, with no clear concentration dependence. However, egg production declined during the exposure phase and nearly stopped between 8 and 14 d in all the treatments (except the control) but resumed during the postexposure phase. Moreover, the resumption of egg production showed a concentration-dependent delay. Our findings suggest that low imidacloprid exposures can restrict reproduction, with potentially severe consequences for the population, notwithstanding the partial recovery in egg production.

DE Bioavailability; Nickel; Water quality guideline; Water quality
ID METAL BIOAVAILABILITY; TOXICITY; MODELS
AB Bioavailability-based approaches have been developed for the regulation of metals in freshwaters in several countries. Empirical multiple linear regression (MLR) models have been developed for nickel that can be applied to aquatic organisms. The MLR models have been compared against the use of previously developed biotic ligand models (BLMs) for the normalization of an ecotoxicity dataset compiled for the derivation of a water quality guideline value that could be applied in Australia and New Zealand. The MLR models were developed from data for a number of specific species and were validated independently to confirm their reliability. An MLR modeling approach using different models for algae, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates performed better than either a pooled MLR model for all taxa or the BLMs, in terms of its ability to correctly predict the results of the tests in the ecotoxicity database based on their water chemistry and a fitted species-specific sensitivity parameter. The present study demonstrates that MLR approaches can be developed and validated to predict chronic nickel toxicity to freshwater ecosystems from existing datasets. The MLR approaches provide a viable alternative to the use of BLMs for taking account of nickel bioavailability in freshwaters for regulatory purposes. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-14.

AB There is emerging concern about the potential health and environmental impacts of nanoplastics in the environment. Information on exposure has been lacking, but a growing amount of ecotoxicological hazard data is now available, allowing a hazard assessment to be conducted for nanoplastics in freshwater and marine systems. Based on a critical evaluation of published studies and the construction of probabilistic species sensitivity distributions (PSSDs), we present a comprehensive, state-of-the-art understanding of nanoplastic ecotoxicity. Different freshwater and marine datasets were constructed based on different data quality levels, and for each of the datasets, PSSDs were built for both mass- and particle number-based concentrations. Predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) were then extracted from the PSSDs. We report PNECs at 99 and 72 mu g L-1, respectively, for the freshwater and marine dataset after the removal of data measured in the presence of sodium azide (NaN3), which is considered to be a major interfering factor in the ecotoxicity testing of nanoplastics. By comparing the PNECs, we found that nanoplastics are less toxic than microplastics and many engineered nanomaterials. In addition, the effects of size and polymer type on toxicity were also statistically tested. We observed no significant difference in ecotoxicity for nanoplastics of different sizes, whereas polystyrene nanoplastics were significantly more toxic than all other tested nanoplastics. In conclusion, the results we present provide a comprehensive description of nanoplastic ecotoxicity based on current knowledge. The results constitute a fundamental step toward an environmental risk assessment for nanoplastics in freshwater and marine systems. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-11. (c) 2020 The Authors.

AB Evaluating sediment recontamination due to storm water discharges is important when evaluating the long-term effectiveness of sediment remediation efforts at reducing biological impacts. The bioaccumulation of the heavy metals zinc, nickel, copper, cadmium, mercury, and lead and the metalloid arsenic in a clam (Macoma nasuta) was studied in surficial sediments before and after storm water inputs from Paleta Creek, California, USA, during wet seasons in 2015 to 2016 and 2016 to 2017. The bioaccumulation was compared with bulk sediment concentrations and porewater concentrations measured by diffusion gradient in thin film devices. Significant reductions in biota accumulation and porewater concentrations were observed in samples collected after storm seasons compared with before storm seasons despite bulk sediment concentrations remaining the same or increasing. This was apparently the result of the deposition of storm water contaminants in low bioavailable forms. The bioaccumulation of all the measured contaminants showed a positive significant correlation with porewater concentrations (p < 0.1, alpha = 0.1) and weak or no correlations with bulk sediment concentration. In conclusion, observed bulk sediment recontamination due to storm water should not be assumed to lead directly to greater biota accumulation without bioavailability assessment.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-10.

AB Mercury is found in Arctic marine mammals found in Arctic marine mammals that are important in the diet of northern Indigenous peoples. The objectives of the present long-term study, spanning a 45-yr period, were to 1) investigate the temporal trends of total mercury (THg; muscle and liver) and selenium (Se; liver) in ringed seals (Pusa hispida) from different regions of the Canadian Arctic; and 2) examine possible relationships with age, diet, and climate parameters such as air temperature, precipitation, climatic indices, and ice-coverage. Ringed seals were collected by hunters in northern communities in the Beaufort Sea, Central Arctic, Eastern Baffin Island, Hudson Bay, and Ungava/Nunatsiavut regions (Canada) between 1972 and 2017. Mercury levels did not change through time in seal liver, but THg levels in muscle decreased in seals from Hudson Bay (-0.91%/yr) and Ungava/Nunatsiavut (-1.30%/yr). The THg concentrations in seal tissues increased significantly with seal trophic level, inferred from nitrogen stable isotopes. Carbon stable isotope values in seal muscle decreased significantly through time at all sites. Selenium-to-THg ratios were found to be >1 for all years and regions. Variation partitioning analyses across regions indicated that THg trends in seals were mostly explained by age (7.3-21.7%), climate parameters (3.5-12.5%), and diet (up to 9%); climate indices (i.e., Arctic and North Atlantic Oscillations, Pacific/North American pattern) explained the majority of the climate portion. The THg levels had a positive relationship with Arctic Oscillation for multiple regions. Associations of THg with air temperature, total precipitation, and sea-ice coverage, as well as with North Atlantic Oscillation and Pacific/North American pattern were found to vary with tissue type and geographical area.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-13.

AB Floodplains downstream of urban catchments are sinks for potentially toxic trace elements. An intensification of the hydrological cycle and changing land use will result in floodplains becoming inundated for longer durations in the future. We collected intact soil cores from a floodplain meadow downstream of an urban catchment and subjected them to an inundation/drainage cycle in the laboratory to investigate the effect of flood duration on trace element concentrations in the soil porewater. The porewater concentrations of Ni, Cr, and Zn increased, whereas Cu and Pb decreased with flood duration. All the Cr present in porewaters was identified as Cr(III). Copper concentrations increased after drainage but Pb mobility remained suppressed. Both pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased with flood duration but were lower in treatments that were drained for the longest duration (which were also the treatments flooded for the shortest duration). The porewater concentrations of Cr and Ni decreased after drainage to levels below those observed before inundation, mirroring the DOC concentrations. We concluded that the duration of floodplain inundation does have an influence on the environmental fate of trace elements but that flooding does not influence all trace elements in the same way. The implications of an intensification of the hydrological cycle over the coming decades are that floodplains may become a source of some trace elements to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-12.

Twenty-five 2700-L tubs were arranged, stratified randomly, on the bed of Magela Creek, a seasonally flowing, sandy stream channel in the Alligator Rivers Region of northern Australia. The experiment comprised 5 replicates of 4 nominal Mg treatments, 2.5, 7.5, 23, and 68 mg L-1, and a control. Phytoplankton biomass, and diatom, zooplankton, and macroinvertebrate assemblages present in the treatment tubs were sampled before and after Mg addition. A significant negative relationship between phytoplankton biomass and Mg was observed 4 wk after Mg addition as measured by chlorophyll a concentrations (r(2) = 0.97,p = 0.01). This result was supported by reductions in some major phytoplankton groups in response to increasing Mg concentrations, in the same experiment and from independent field studies. There was a significant negative relationship between zooplankton assemblage similarity (to control) and Mg concentrations (r(2) = 0.96,p = 0.002). Seven weeks after Mg addition, macroinvertebrate assemblages were dominated by 3 microcrustacean groups (Ostracoda, Cladocera, and Copepoda), each reaching maximum abundance at intermediate Mg concentrations (i.e., unimodal responses). The responses of phytoplankton and zooplankton were used to derive assemblage effect concentrations (Mg concentrations resulting inx% of the assemblage change [ECx]). Magnesium concentrations resulting in assemblage EC01 values were <3 mg L-1. Together with candidate guideline values from other laboratory- and field-based lines of evidence, the mesocosm EC01 values were incorporated into a weight-of-evidence framework for a robust regulatory approach to environmental protection.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-15.

AB Infochemicals act as inter- or intraspecific messengers. The literature suggests complex interactions between infochemicals (mainly predator cues) and chemical (e.g., pesticide) effects, with their direction and magnitude depending on the cue origin, pesticide identity, and test species. With the present study we assessed the impact of alarm cues alone and in combination with the neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid on leaf consumption, predation onBaetisnymphs, and dry weight of the amphipodGammarus fossarum. Alarm cues (ground gammarids) and thiacloprid alone decreased gammarid leaf consumption with increasing intensities. At a defined alarm cue intensity, which alone did not cause a significant reduction in gammarid feeding, thiacloprid-induced feeding effects were additive. During an experiment targeting gammarid predation onBaetisnymphs (120 h), thiacloprid and alarm cues alone did increase and reduce predation significantly, respectively. Moreover, alarm cues led to a lower final gammarid dry weight. However, alarm cues did not affect response variables during a second predation experiment performed at a higher thiacloprid concentration (2 vs 0.75 mu g/L). This discrepancy in alarm cue effects highlights either a varying susceptibility of the test species to these cues among experiments or that cue quality is fluctuating. Thus, the present study highlights a considerable variability in the individual and interactive effects of infochemicals and chemical stressors on aquatic biota, an insight relevant in the assessment of multiple stressors.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-10.

AB The validity of soil toxicity databases for predicting ecological impacts in the field is rarely explored. The present study was set up to test whether laboratory toxicity data and the combined concepts of metal availability and mixture toxicity can predict ecological impact in mining-affected soils. Metal and As contamination gradients were sampled approximately 5 different mines in Mexico where plant cover and abundances exhibited clear dose-related responses. Soils were analyzed for total and isotopically exchangeable (labile) concentrations of Ni, Cu, Cd, Pb, and As and for soil properties affecting the availability of these elements. Six different indices of toxic doses were compared to evaluate their accuracy in describing the field response expressed as relative abundance and cover. Each index was based on a different method to calculate the sum of toxic units (sigma TUs) in soil, with 1 toxic unit equal to the concentration of the element in soil yielding 50% adverse effect on plants with median sensitivity as recorded in a recent database of salt-spiked soils. Toxic concentrations in the mine-impacted soils were dominated by Zn and As. In the field, 50% reduced cover or abundance was found at 10 to 13 sigma TUs if these were based on total soil concentrations and thresholds derived from freshly spiked soils, indicating a largely overestimated toxic effect. If thresholds were corrected for differences in availability among freshly spiked soils and spiked and laboratory-aged soils, the overestimation of field toxicity was 5- to 6-fold, irrespective of the consideration of soil properties. Finally, the sigma TU calculated only with labile metals and As overestimated the field toxicity by factors 1.1 to 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1-7; i.e., rather accurate and indicating some Zn-As antagonism as confirmed in experimental studies). That latter index of dose yielded a bell-shaped response on species richness peaking at approximately 1.6 sigma TU. Overall, the present study shows that the current toxicity databases of metals can predict the impact of metal contamination on plant communities within factor 2, expressing the dose as soil-labile concentrations and using the concentration addition concept in these mixed polluted environments.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-13.

AB As part of an effort to develop avian ecotoxicity information for poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) associated with aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) used by the Department of Defense, the subacute toxicity of PFOS, PFOA, PFOS + PFOA, 3M AFFF, and Ansul AFFF to Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) chicks was determined. Ten-day-old Japanese quail were administered treated feed for 5 d and then fed untreated feed for 18 d. Analyzed concentrations of PFOS, PFOA, and PFOS + PFOA ranged from 62 to 1955, 162 to 1208, and 43 + 45 to 296 + 292 mg kg feed(-1). Analyzed concentrations of PFOS in feed containing the 3M AFFF ranged from 73 to 1399 mg kg feed(-1), and formulated concentrations of 6:2 fluorotelomer thioamido sulfonate in feed containing the Ansul AFFF ranged from 9 to 1118 mg kg feed(-1). Average daily doses resulting in 50% mortality at day 5 were 38 (34-43), 68 (63-74), 55 (51-59), and 130 (103-164) mg PFOS, PFOA, PFOS + PFOA, and PFOS in 3M AFFF kg body weight(-1) d(-1). Ansul AFFF did not result in any mortalities. Dietary concentrations resulting in 50% mortality at day 5 were 351 (275-450), 496 (427-575), 398 (339-468), and 467 (390-559) mg PFOS, PFOA, PFOS + PFOA, and PFOS in 3M AFFF kg feed(-1).

AB Regulatory environmental risk assessment, applied to establish a protection limit for all bacterial diversity in surface waters, relies on a growth inhibition test performed on a single species of cyanobacteria and the activated sludge respiration inhibition test. Recently, the ability of this approach to protect adequately for bacteria that provide important ecosystem services has been questioned, and empirical data on additional species to further investigate the effectiveness of the environmental risk assessment are urgently required. We present the development and validation of a cost-effective and time-efficient microplate assay that is comparable to the traditional shake flask test for measurement of cyanobacteria growth rate after chemical exposure. The assay has been optimized to ensure that comparisons of cyanobacteria sensitivity under exponential growth are assessed across equivalent experimental conditions using phycocyanin fluorescence as a surrogate for cell density. The test system is validated using potassium dichromate, and the results are compared with those obtained in an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2011) test guideline 201 shake flask test system. This assay is suitable for the screening of new and legacy chemicals (including antibiotics) for which ecotoxicology data are lacking across a wide range of cyanobacteria, with the aim of developing more comprehensive environmental risk assessment.

AB Quantum dots have generated great interest because of their optical properties, both to life sciences and electronics applications. However, possible risks to the environment associated with these nanoparticles are still under investigation. The present study aimed to evaluate the toxicity of suspensions of cadmium telluride (CdTe) quantum dots to Biomphalaria glabrata mollusks, a very sensitive aquatic environmental bioindicator for physical and chemical agents. Toxicity was examined by using embryos and adult mollusks as well as hemocytes. The distribution of cadmium in the organs of adults was also assessed. Effects of the stabilizing agent of the quantum dots were also evaluated. Animals were exposed to suspensions of quantum dots for 24 h, at concentrations varying from 1.2 to 20 nM for embryos and from 50 to 400 nM for adult mollusks. Results showed that suspensions of quantum dots induced malformations and mortality in embryos and mortality in adults, depending on the concentration applied. In the cytotoxicity study, hemocyte apoptosis was observed in adults exposed to the highest concentration of quantum dots applied as well as to the stabilizing agent. Cell binucleation and micronucleus frequencies were not significative. Bioaccumulation evaluation revealed that quantum dots targeted the digestive gland (hepatopancreas). Taken together, outcomes suggested that specific nano-effects related directly not only to composition but also to the aggregation of quantum dots may be mediating the observed toxicity. Thus B. glabrata was determined to be a very sensitive species for interpreting possible nano-effects in aquatic environments. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-9. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB In March 2017, 26 American goldfinches (Spinus tristis) were found dead following a drench application of imidacloprid in California (USA). Identical seed fragments were present in the digestive tracts. Imidacloprid was detected in 4 separate pooled samples from 18 birds, in crop/gizzard contents (4.8 +/- 1.3 ppm; range 2.2-8.5 ppm) and liver tissues (3.9 +/- 0.6 ppm; range 2.1-4.8 ppm). We suspect that fallen elm (Ulmus sp.) seeds were contaminated with imidacloprid during the drench application and subsequently ingested, resulting in acute toxicity and death.

AB The trophic magnification of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and selected nonlegacy halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) was determined in the food web of Lake Ontario (ON, Canada). In all, 28 Br-3-Br-8-PBDEs and 24 HOCs (10 of which had not been targeted previously) were analyzed. Average concentrations of sigma 28PBDEs in fish ranged between 79.7 +/- 54.2 ng/g lipid weight in alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and 815 +/- 695 ng/g lipid weight in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). For invertebrates, concentrations were between 13.4 ng/g lipid weight (net plankton; >110 mu m) and 41.9 ng/g lipid weight in Diaporeia (Diaporeia hoyi). Detection frequency (DF) for HOCs was highest for anti-Dechlorane Plus (anti-DDC-CO), 1,3-diiodobenzene (1,3-DiiB), tribromo-methoxy-methylbenzene (ME-TBP), allyl 2,4,6-tribromophenyl ether (TBP-AE), pentabromocyclododecene (PBCYD), alpha+beta-tetrabromocylcooctane (TBCO), 2-bromoallyl 2,4,6-tribromophenyl ether (BATE), and pentabromotoluene (PBT; DF for all = 100% in lake trout). Tetrabromoxylene (TBX), dibromopropyl 2,4,6-tribromophenyl ether (TBP-DBPE), and syn-DDC-CO were also frequently detected in trout (DF = 70-78%), whereas 2,3,4,5,6-pentabromoethyl benzene (PBEB) was detected only in plankton. Several HOCs were reported in aquatic biota in the Great Lakes (USA/Canada) for the first time in the present study, including PBCYD, 1,3DiiB, BATE, TBP-DBPE, PBT, alpha + beta-TBCO, and ME-TBP. The Br4-6-BDEs (-47, -85, -99, -100, -153, and -154) all had prey-weighted biomagnification factors (BMFPW) values >6, whereas BMFPW values for Br7-8-BDEs were <1. The highest BMFPW values of non-PBDEs were for TBP-DBPE (10.6 +/- 1.34) and ME-TBP (4.88 +/- 0.60), whereas TBP-AE had a BMFPW value of <1. Significant (p <= 0.05) trophic magnification factors (TMFs), both positive and negative, were found for Br4-8-BDEs (BDE 196 = 0.4; BDE 154 = 9.5) and for bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE; 0.53), PBCYD (1.8), 1,3-DiiB (0.33), and pentabromobenzene (PBB; 0.25). Food chain length was found to have a significant influence on the TMF values. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1198-1210. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Phenicol antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and florfenicol, are commonly used in the veterinary and aquaculture fields to treat diseases and have frequently been detected in aquatic environments. Nevertheless, there is limited information regarding the effects of phenicol antibiotics on aquatic nontarget species. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the long-term (21-d) influence on the reproduction and growth of and the acute (24-h) oxidative response and tissue damage in the crustacean Daphnia magna after exposure to phenicol drugs, including their environmental concentrations. The results indicate that D. magna exposed to florfenicol are likely to cause more adverse effects than those exposed to chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol over long-term (21-d) exposures. Furthermore, changes in biochemical biomarkers such as malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and reduced glutathione (GSH) induced by individual and mixtures of phenicol antibiotics were also observed. Low concentrations of chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol + florfenicol, and chloramphenicol + thiamphenicol significantly increased the MDA levels of D. magna after 24-h exposures, causing cellular oxidative damage in the animals. In addition, discrepancies between CAT activities and GSH levels were observed, underscoring the need to evaluate multiple indicators of oxidative stress in toxicological studies using D. magna as a model.

AB The idea that the hazard of contaminants is exclusively related to their toxic effects does not consider the fact that some organisms can avoid contamination, preventing toxicity. Although inferences about avoidance are made in most behavioral ecotoxicology studies, assessment of the real spatial displacement (organisms moving toward another habitat to escape contamination) is difficult due to the type of exposure (confined and mandatory) used in the bioassays: a forced exposure approach. A complementary approach using nonforced exposure systems to assess how contaminants affect the spatial distribution of organisms in a bicompartmented (toxic or nontoxic) environment has long been described. Recently, this nonforced approach has been developed to include a multi compartmented system in which different samples can be simultaneously tested. The aim of the present review was to describe the importance of the nonforced, multicompartmented exposure approach to simulate a gradient or patches of contamination, to describe the 2 main exposure systems, and to highlight the ecological relevance of including spatial avoidance and habitat preference in ecotoxicological studies. The multicompartmentalization of the system makes it possible to simulate more complex scenarios and therefore include new ecological concepts in bioassays. We also contrasted spatial avoidance in the nonforced exposure systems with the behavioral endpoints measured under other exposure systems. Finally, we showed that the nonforced, multicompartmented exposure approach makes it possible 1) to improve environmental risk assessments by adding the dispersion pattern of organisms in a multihabitat scenario, and 2) to integrate ecological concepts such as recolonization of recovering habitats, loss of habitat connectivity, habitat fragmentation, and contamination-driven metapopulation, which have received limited attention in ecotoxicological studies.

AB The ubiquitous and persistent contaminant triclosan is known to cause developmental and behavioral toxicity in fish, but few studies have evaluated the long-term effects of these responses. We used a phenotypically anchored approach to evaluate the behavioral responses caused by early exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of triclosan to better understand the risk triclosan poses to fish. Zebrafish were exposed to 0, 0.4, 4, or 40 mu g triclosan/L (nominal concentrations) for 5 d followed by depuration for 16 d to assess effects on mortality, development, and foraging efficiency. Because foraging efficiency can be impacted by neurological and structural alterations, we assessed morphological and behavioral indicators of neurotoxicity and morphology of craniofacial features associated with gape to identify potential underlying mechanisms associated with altered foraging behaviors. To our knowledge, we are the first to show that early exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of triclosan impairs foraging efficiency in larval fish by 10%, leading to emaciation and reduced growth and survival. The cause of the impacts of triclosan on foraging efficiency remains unknown, because effects were not associated with overt indicators of neurotoxicity or grossly malformed craniofacial structures. Our results suggest that early exposure to triclosan has the potential to impact the sustainability of wild fish populations, and thus the mechanism underlying behavioral alterations following exposure to triclosan warrants further study.

AB There is increasing scientific and public concern over the presence of microplastics in the natural environment. We present the results of a systematic review of the literature to assess the weight of evidence for microplastics causing environmental harm. We conclude that microplastics do occur in surface water and sediments. Fragments and fibers predominate, with beads making up only a small proportion of the detected microplastic types. Concentrations detected are orders of magnitude lower than those reported to affect endpoints such as biochemistry, feeding, reproduction, growth, tissue inflammation and mortality in organisms. The evidence for microplastics acting as a vector for hydrophobic organic compounds to accumulate in organisms is also weak. The available data therefore suggest that these materials are not causing harm to the environment. There is, however, a mismatch between the particle types, size ranges, and concentrations of microplastics used in laboratory tests and those measured in the environment. Select environmental compartments have also received limited attention. There is an urgent need for studies that address this mismatch by performing high quality and more holistic monitoring studies alongside more environmentally realistic effects studies. Only then will we be able to fully characterize risks of microplastics to the environment to support the introduction of regulatory controls that can make a real positive difference to environmental quality.

AB A predominant concern following oil spills is toxicity to aquatic organisms. However, few data are available on effects in deep-sea cold water fishes. The present study had 3 major objectives. The first was to investigate the relative sensitivity of the deep-sea species Anoplopoma fimbria (sablefish) to acute effects of 3 aromatic compounds (toluene, 2-methylnaphthalene, and phenanthrene), dispersant alone, and chemically enhanced water accommodated fractions (CEWAFs) of Alaskan North Slope crude oil. The second was to determine the critical target lipid body burden (CTLBB) for sablefish by fitting aromatic hydrocarbon toxicity data to the target lipid model (TLM), which then allowed expression of CEWAF exposures in terms of dissolved oil toxic units. The final aim was to apply a passive sampling method that targets bioavailable, dissolved hydrocarbons as an alternative analytical technique for improved CEWAF exposure assessment. The results indicate that sablefish exhibit sensitivity to Corexit 9500 (96-h median lethal concentration [LC50]=72.2mg/L) within the range reported for other fish species. However, the acute CTLBB of 39.4 +/- 2.1mol/g(octanol) lies at the lower end of the sensitivity range established for aquatic species. The utility of both toxic units and passive sampling measurements for describing observed toxicity of dispersed oil is discussed. The present study is novel in that a new test species is investigated to address the uncertainty regarding the sensitivity of deep-sea fishes, while also employing modeling and measurements to improve exposure characterization in oil toxicity tests.

AB The risk assessment of nanomaterials is essential for regulatory purposes and for sustainable nanotechnological development. Although the application of graphene oxide has been widely exploited, its environmental risk is not well understood because several environmental conditions can affect its behavior and toxicity. In the present study, the graphene oxide effect from aquatic ecosystems was assessed considering the interaction with humic acid on 9 organisms: Raphidocelis subcapitata (green algae), Lemna minor (aquatic plant), Lactuca sativa (lettuce), Daphnia magna (planktonic microcrustacean), Artemia salina (brine shrimp), Chironomus sancticaroli (Chironomidae), Hydra attenuata (freshwater polyp), and Caenorhabditis elegans and Panagrolaimus sp. (nematodes). The no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) was calculated for each organism. The different criteria used to calculate NOEC values were transformed and plotted as a log-logistic function. The hypothetical 5 to 50% hazardous concentration values were, respectively, 0.023 (0.005-0.056) and 0.10 (0.031-0.31) mg L-1 for graphene oxide with and without humic acid, respectively. The safest scenario associated with the predicted no-effect concentration values for graphene oxide in the aquatic compartment were estimated as 20 to 100gL(-1) (in the absence of humic acid) and 5 to 23gL(-1) (in the presence of humic acid). Finally, the present approach contributed to the risk assessment of graphene oxide-based nanomaterials and the establishment of nano-regulations. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:1998-2012.

AB Little is known about the release of metal engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) from consumer goods, including lumber treated with micronized copper. Micronized copper is a recent form of antifouling wood preservative containing nanosized copper particles for use in pressure-treated lumber. The present study investigated the concentrations released and the release rate of total copper over the course of 133 d under freshwater, estuarine, and marine salinity conditions (0, 1, 10, and 30 parts per thousand) for several commercially available pressure-treated lumbers: micronized copper azole (MCA) at 0.96 and 2.4kg/m(3), alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ) at 0.30 and 9.6kg/m(3), and chromated copper arsenate (CCA) at 40kg/m(3). Lumber was tested as blocks and as sawdust. Overall, copper was released from all treated lumber samples. Under leaching conditions, total release ranged from 2 to 55% of the measured copper originally in the lumber, with release rate constants from the blocks of 0.03 to 2.71 (units per day). Generally, measured release and modeled equilibrium concentrations were significantly higher in the estuarine conditions compared with freshwater or marine salinities, whereas rate constants showed very limited differences between salinities. Furthermore, organic carbon was released during the leaching and demonstrated a significant relationship with released copper concentrations as a function of salinity. The results indicate that copper is released into estuarine/marine waters from multiple wood treatments including lumber amended with nanoparticle-sized copper.

AB As technological interest and environmental emissions of the rare earth elements increase, it is becoming more important to assess their potential environmental impact. Samarium (Sm) is a lanthanide of intermediate molar mass that is used in numerous high-technology applications including wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles. The present study relates the speciation of Sm determined in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) to its bioavailability to the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The free ion concentration was determined using a cation exchange resin (ion exchange technique) in dynamic mode and compared with thermodynamic modeling. Short-term biouptake experiments were performed in the presence of 4 types of NOM: Suwannee River fulvic acids, Pahokee Peat fulvic acids, Suwannee River humic acids, and a Luther Marsh dissolved organic matter isolate (90-95% humic acids). It was clearly shown that even a small amount of NOM (0.5mgCL(-1)) resulted in a significant decrease (10 times) in the Sm internalization fluxes. Furthermore, complexation with humic acids (and the corresponding reduction in Sm bioavailability) was stronger than that with fulvic acids. The results showed that the experimentally measured (free) Sm was a better predictor of Sm internalization than either the total concentrations or the free ion concentrations obtained using thermodynamic modeling.

AB There has been increasing interest in the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on wild bees. In solitary bee species the direct link between each individual female and reproductive success offers the opportunity to evaluate effects on individuals. The present study investigated effects of exposure to winter oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam-treated seed on reproductive behavior and output of solitary red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) released in 6 pairs of fields over a 2-yr period and confined to tunnels in a single year. After adjustment to the number of females released, there was significantly lower production of cells and cocoons/female in tunnels than in open field conditions. This difference may be because of the lack of alternative forage within the tunnels. Under open field conditions, palynology of the pollen provisions within the nests demonstrated a maximum average of 31% oilseed rape pollen at any site, with Quercus (oak) contributing up to 86% of the pollen. There were no significant effects from exposure to oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam-treated seed from nest establishment through cell production to emergence under tunnel or field conditions.

AB A framework is presented that is intended to facilitate the evaluation of potential aquatic ecological risks resulting from discharges of down-the-drain chemicals. A scenario is presented using representatives of many of the types of chemicals that are treated domestically. Predicted environmental chemical concentrations are based on reported loading rates and routine removal rates for 3 types of treatment: trickling filter, activated sludge secondary treatment, and activated sludge plus advanced oxidation process as well as instream effluent dilution. In tier I, predicted effluent concentrations were compared with the lowest predicted-no-effect concentration (PNEC) obtained from the literature using safety factors as needed. A cumulative risk characterization ratio (cumRCR) <1.0 indicates that risk is unlikely and no further action is needed. Otherwise, a tier 2 assessment is used, in which PNECs are based on trophic level. If tier 2 indicates a possible risk, then a retrospective assessment is recommended. In tier 1, the cumRCR was >1.0 for all 3 treatment types in our scenario, even though no chemical exceeded a hazard quotient of 1.0 in activated sludge or advanced oxidation process. In tier 2, activated sludge yielded a lower cumRCR than trickling filter because of higher removal rates, and the cumRCR in the advanced oxidation process was <<1.0. Based on the maximum cumulative risk ratio (MCR), more than one-third of the predicted risk was accounted for by one chemical, and at least 90% was accounted for by 3 chemicals, indicating that few chemicals influenced the mixture risk in our scenario. We show how a retrospective assessment can test whether certain chemicals hypothesized as potential drivers in the prospective assessment could have, or are having, deleterious effects on aquatic life.

AB Avian mortality events are common following large-scale oil spills. However, the sublethal effects of oil on birds exposed to light external oiling are not clearly understood. We found that American oystercatchers (area of potential impact n = 42, reference n = 21), black skimmers (area of potential impact n = 121, reference n = 88), brown pelicans (area of potential impact n = 91, reference n = 48), and great egrets (area of potential impact n = 57, reference n = 47) captured between 20 June 2010 and 23 February 2011 following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill experienced oxidative injury to erythrocytes, had decreased volume of circulating erythrocytes, and showed evidence of a regenerative hematological response in the form of increased reticulocytes compared with reference populations. Erythrocytic inclusions consistent with Heinz bodies were present almost exclusively in birds from sites impacted with oil, a finding pathognomonic for oxidative injury to erythrocytes. Average packed cell volumes were 4 to 19% lower and average reticulocyte counts were 27 to 40% higher in birds with visible external oil than birds from reference sites. These findings provide evidence that small amounts of external oil exposure are associated with hemolytic anemia. Furthermore, we found that some birds captured from the area impacted by the spill but with no visible oiling also had erythrocytic inclusion bodies, increased reticulocytes, and reduced packed cell volumes when compared with birds from reference sites. Thus, birds suffered hematologic injury despite no visible oil at the time of capture. Together, these findings suggest that adverse effects of oil spills on birds may be more widespread than estimates based on avian mortality or severe visible oiling. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB The monitoring of fecal contamination (human and animal) is an incessant challenge. In this approach, microbiological methods play an important role, though with substantial limitations. Organic compounds, such as sterols, are often used to trace fecal contamination. Although the fecal sterols profiles of some animals are already known, capybara, a typical mammal from South America, is a significant contributor to aquatic fecal contamination because of its water dependence; and still there is no one way, scientifically speaking, to trace its fecal contribution. The aim of the present study was to provide a tool to measure the temporal fecal contribution of capybara in aquatic systems. We examined the sterol content of capybara feces and compared with another species (sheep, cow, horse, pig, hen, duck, cat, dog, opossum, and human). From numerical relationships among fecal sterols, 6 ratios were delineated and tested to assess their potential to identify the capybara feces contribution in contaminated environments. Statistical analysis showed that 3 ratios were able to differentiate capybara feces from other sources. Such ratios were applied in samples of a sediment core from an urban area in south Brazil with a large capybara population. The temporal trend showed a significant contribution of capybara feces in the last 100 yr. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB In the present study, we evaluated the spatial and temporal trends of current-use pesticides in surface water and sediments as well as their relationship with hydrological stream dynamics within the agricultural watershed of El Crespo stream (Buenos Aires Province, Argentina). We sampled 2 contrasting sites: site 1 (upstream), surrounded by agricultural lands, and site 2 (downstream), surrounded by natural grasslands. Most of the applied pesticides (glyphosate, 2,4-D, atrazine, tebuconazole, and imidacloprid) were detected at high frequencies in surface water samples at both sites. However, only glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) were present at high concentrations and had a significant spatial-temporal trend. The highest concentrations were found during spring 2014 at site 1, in association with the intense rains that occurred in that season. The fact that glyphosate and AMPA concentrations were higher than the rest of the studied compounds is closely related to the land use within the watershed, as glyphosate was the most applied herbicide during the fallow period of glyphosate-resistant crops (soybean, maize). The pesticide mixture had a significant spatial-temporal trend, reaching the highest levels during storm flow events in spring 2014. The intensive rains in spring 2014 could be the main factor influencing stream hydrology and pesticide behavior at El Crespo watershed. The estimated annual pesticide losses were 3.11g/ha at site 1 and 0.72g/ha at site 2. This result indicates that an attenuation process could be decreasing pesticide loads during downstream transport from site 1 to site 2. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3206-3216. (c) 2017 SETAC

AB Within Canada, screening-level assessments for chemical substances are required to determine whether the substances pose a risk to human health and/or the environment, and as appropriate, risk management strategies. In response to the volume of metal and metal-containing substances, process efficiencies were introduced using a metal-moiety approach, whereby substances that contain a common metal moiety are assessed simultaneously as a group, with the moiety of concern consisting of the metal ion. However, for certain subgroups, such as organometals or organic metal salts, the organic moiety or parent substance may be of concern, rather than simply the metal ion. To further investigate the need for such additional consideration, certain substances were evaluated: zinc (Zn)-containing inorganic (Zn chloride [ZnCl2] and Zn oxide) and organic (organometal: Zn diethyldithiocarbamate [Zn(DDC)(2)] and organic metal salts (Zn stearate [ZnSt] and 4-chloro-2-nitrobenzenediazonium tetrachlorozincate [BCNZ]). The toxicity of the substances were assessed using plant (Trifolium pratense and Elymus lanceolatus) and soil invertebrate (Folsomia candida and Eisenia andrei) tests in a sandy soil. Effect measures were determined based on total metal and total parent analyses (for organic substances). In general, the inorganic Zn substances were less toxic than the organometals and organic metal salts, with 50% effective concentrations ranging from 11 to >5194mg Zn kg(-1) dry soil. The data demonstrate the necessity for alternate approaches in the assessment of organo-metal complexes, with the organic moieties or parent substances warranting consideration rather than the metal ion alone. In this instance, the organometals and organic metal salts were significantly more toxic than other test substances despite their low total Zn content. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3324-3332.

AB Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are widely used in the production of aquatic products and considered to be a significant contributing factor to the burden of both natural and aquaculture environments. However, the main types of fluoroquinolones present in aquaculture systems have not been determined. The objectives of the present study were to explore the occurrence of residual fluoroquinolone antibiotics in fish muscle tissues sampled from across the entire aquaculture season in the Tai Lake basin in China and to assess the dietary risks associated with the upcoming vendible fish in the last month of the aquaculture season. Fluoroquinolones were detected in 95.69% of all fish samples, and the concentrations ranged from the limit of quantification (LOQ) to 47 108.00g<bold>kg</bold>-1. Enrofloxacin contributed the most among the 9 fluoroquinolone antibiotics tested. Of the 4 fish species studied, enrofloxacin was present in bream at significant (p<0.05) concentrations in August, with an average value of 321.45g<bold>kg</bold>-1, while enrofloxacin concentrations peaked in crab and shrimp in September, with average values of 6949.60 and 460.82g<bold>kg</bold>-1, respectively. However, different patterns were observed in perch, suggesting that other categories of antibiotics may be used in the production of this fish. Dietary risk assessment showed that the residual levels and estimated daily intake in bream, perch, and shrimp were far below the maximum residual level and acceptable daily intake. However, the average residual level in crab exceeded the maximum residual level, and the estimated daily intake value accounted for 78.49% of the acceptable daily intake, indicating potential consumption risk. In summary, the present study aims to guide the production and consumption of aquatic products. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:2899-2905. (c) 2017 SETAC

AB Methylmercury (MeHg) is an aquatic contaminant that can be transferred to terrestrial predators by emergent aquatic insects such as odonates (damselflies and dragonflies). We assessed the effects of month and pond permanence on odonate-mediated MeHg flux (calculated as emergent odonate biomass x MeHg concentration) in 10 experimental ponds and the potential risk to nestling red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) posed by consuming MeHg-contaminated odonates. Emergent odonates were collected weekly from permanent ponds with bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus; n = 5) and semipermanent ponds without fish (n = 5) over an 8-mo period (January-August 2015). The MeHg flux from damselflies, aeshnid dragonflies, and libellulid dragonflies began in March and peaked in April, May, and June, respectively, and then declined throughout the rest of the summer. Odonate-mediated MeHg flux from semipermanent ponds without fish was greater than that from permanent ponds with fish. Nesting of red-winged blackbirds overlapped with peak odonate emergence and odonate-mediated MeHg flux. Because their diet can be dominated by damselflies and dragonflies, we tested the hypothesis that MeHg-contaminated odonates may pose a health risk to nestling red-winged blackbirds. Concentrations of MeHg in odonates exceeded wildlife values (the minimum odonate MeHg concentrations causing physiologically significant doses in consumers) for nestlings, suggesting that MeHg-contaminated odonates can pose a health risk to nestling red-winged blackbirds.

AB Leaf litter is a major source of carbon and energy for stream food webs, while both leaf-decomposing microorganisms and macroinvertebrate leaf shredders can be affected by fungicides. Despite the potential for season-long fungicide exposure for these organisms, however, such chronic exposures have not yet been considered. Using an artificial stream facility, effects of a chronic (lasting up to 8 wk) exposure to a mixture of 5 fungicides (sum concentration 20 mu g/L) on leaf-associated microorganisms and the key leaf shredder Gammarus fossarum were therefore assessed. While bacterial density and microorganism-mediated leaf decomposition remained unaltered, fungicide exposure reduced fungal biomass (<= 71%) on leaves from day 28 onward. Gammarids responded to the combined stress from consumption of fungicide-affected leaves and waterborne exposure with a reduced abundance (<= 18%), which triggered reductions in final population biomass (18%) and in the number of precopula pairs (<= 22%) but could not fully explain the decreased leaf consumption (19%), lipid content (<= 43%; going along with an altered composition of fatty acids), and juvenile production (35%). In contrast, fine particulate organic matter production and stream respiration were unaffected. Our results imply that long-term exposure of leaf-associated fungi and shredders toward fungicides may result in detrimental implications in stream food webs and impairments of detrital material fluxes. These findings render it important to understand decomposer communities' long-term adaptational capabilities to ensure that functional integrity is safeguarded. (C) 2017 SETAC.

AB Incorporating biotransformation in bioaccumulation assessments of hydrophobic chemicals in both aquatic and terrestrial organisms in a simple, rapid, and cost-effective manner is urgently needed to improve bioaccumulation assessments of potentially bioaccumulative substances. One approach to estimate whole-animal biotransformation rate constants is to combine in vitro measurements of hepatic biotransformation kinetics with in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) and bioaccumulation modeling. An established IVIVE modeling approach exists for pharmaceuticals (referred to in the present study as IVIVE-Ph) and has recently been adapted for chemical bioaccumulation assessments in fish. The present study proposes and tests an alternative IVIVE-B technique to support bioaccumulation assessment of hydrophobic chemicals with a log octanol-water partition coefficient (K-OW) >= 4 in mammals. The IVIVE-B approach requires fewer physiological and physiochemical parameters than the IVIVE-Ph approach and does not involve interconversions between clearance and rate constants in the extrapolation. Using in vitro depletion rates, the results show that the IVIVE-B and IVIVE-Ph models yield similar estimates of rat whole-organism biotransformation rate constants for hypothetical chemicals with log K-OW >= 4. The IVIVE-B approach generated in vivo biotransformation rate constants and biomagnification factors (BMFs) for benzo[a] pyrene that are within the range of empirical observations. The proposed IVIVE-B technique may be a useful tool for assessing BMFs of hydrophobic organic chemicals in mammals. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Glyphosate is currently the most widely used herbicide in agricultural production. It generally enters aquatic ecosystems through surface water runoff and aerial drift. We evaluated the effect of glyphosate acid on biochemical parameters of periphyton exposed to concentrations of 1, 3, and 6 mg/L in outdoor mesocosms in the presence and absence of the mussel Limnoperna fortunei. Periphyton ash-free dry weight, chlorophyll a content, carotene/chlorophyll a ratio, lipid peroxidation levels, and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were determined at days 0, 1, 7, 14, and 26 of the experimental period. Ash-free dry weight was similar between control and glyphosate-treated periphyton in the absence of L. fortunei. The latter had significantly lower carotene to chlorophyll a ratios and enzyme activities, and higher lipid peroxidation levels and chlorophyll a content than the former. These results show an adverse effect of glyphosate on the metabolism of periphyton community organisms, possibly inducing oxidative stress. On the contrary, no differences were observed in any of these variables between control and glyphosate-treated periphyton in the presence of L. fortunei. Mussels probably attenuated the herbicide effects by contributing to glyphosate dissipation. The results also demonstrate that biochemical markers provide useful information that may warn of herbicide impact on periphyton communities. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB The Deepwater Horizon blowout resulted in the release of millions of barrels of crude oil. As part of the Trustees' Natural Resource Damage Assessment, a testing program was implemented to evaluate the toxicity of Deepwater Horizon oil and oil/dispersant mixtures to aquatic organisms from the Gulf of Mexico. Because of the variety of exposures that likely occurred, the program included 4 Deepwater Horizon oils, which encompassed a range of weathering states, and 3 different oil-in-water mixing methods, for a total of 12 unique water accommodated fractions (WAFs). The present study reports on the chemical characteristics of these 4 Deepwater Horizon oils and 12 WAFs. In addition, to better understand exposure chemistry, an examination was conducted of the effects of WAF preparation parameters-including mixing energy, starting oil composition, and oil-to-water mixing ratios-on the chemical profiles and final concentrations of these 12 WAFs. The results showed that the more weathered the starting oil, the lower the concentrations of the oil constituents in the WAF, with a shift in composition to the less soluble compounds. In addition, higher mixing energies increased the presence of insoluble oil constituents. Finally, at low to mid oil-to-water mixing ratios, the concentration and composition of the WAFs changed with changing mixing ratios; this change was not observed at higher mixing ratios (i.e.,> 1 g oil/L). Ultimately, the present study provides a basic characterization of the oils and WAFs used in the testing program, which helps to support interpretation of the more than 500 Deepwater Horizon Natural Resource Damage Assessment toxicity testing results and to enable a comparison of these results with different tests and with the field.

AB A 1-compartment toxicokinetic model is used to characterize the chemical exposure toxicity space (CETS), providing a novel graphic tool that can aid in the design of aquatic toxicity tests for fish and for interpreting their results. The graph depicts the solution to the differential equation describing the uptake kinetics of a chemical by a modeled fish under conventional bioassay conditions. The model relates the exposure concentration in the water to a dimensionless time and the onset of toxicity as determined by an estimated or assumed critical body residue or incipient lethal aqueous concentration. These concentration graphs are specific to each chemical and exposure and organism parameters and clearly demonstrate differences in toxicity between chemicals and how factors such as hydrophobicity influence the toxic endpoint. The CETS plots can also be used to assess bioconcentration test conditions to ensure that concentrations are well below toxic levels. Illustrative applications are presented using a recent set of high-quality toxicity data. Conversion of concentrations to chemical activities in the plots enables results for different baseline toxicants to be superimposed. For chemicals that have different modes of toxic action, the increased toxicity then becomes apparent. Implications for design and interpretation of aquatic toxicity tests are discussed. The model, and pictorial visualization of the time-course of aquatic toxicity tests, may contribute to improvements in test design, implementation, and interpretation, and to reduced animal usage.

AB Although aquatic organisms in the environment are exposed to mixtures of metals, risk assessment for metals is most commonly performed on a metal-by-metal basis. To increase the knowledge about chronic mixture effects, the authors investigated whether metal mixture effects are dependent on the biological species, mixture composition, and metal concentration ratio. The authors evaluated the effects of quaternary Ni-Zn-Cu-Cd and ternary Ni-Zn-Cu mixtures on 48-h algal growth rate (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and 7-d daphnid reproduction (Ceriodaphnia dubia) using a ray design. Single metals were 3-fold to 42-fold more toxic for C. dubia than for P. subcapitata, based on the 50% effective concentration expressed as free metal activity, the range representing different metals. Statistical analysis of mixture effects showed that the ternary and quaternary mixture effects were antagonistic on algal growth relative to the concentration addition (CA) model, when the analysis was based on dissolved concentrations and on free metal ion activities. Using the independent action (IA) model, mixture effects in both rays were statistically noninteractive for algal growth when the analysis was based on dissolved concentrations; however, the interactions shifted toward antagonism when based on free ion activities. The ternary Ni-Zn-Cu mixture acted antagonistically on daphnid reproduction relative to both reference models, either expressed as free ion activities or dissolved concentrations. When Cd was added to the mixture, however, the mixture effects shifted toward noninteractivity for daphnids. The metal concentration ratio did not significantly influence the magnitude of observed antagonistic effects. Regardless of statistical interactions observed, based on the present study, CA and in most instances also IA can serve as a protective model for ternary Ni-Zn-Cu and quaternary Ni-Zn-Cu-Cd toxicity to both species.

AB Male fish are susceptible to developing intersex, a condition characterized by the presence of testicular oocytes. In the present study, the relationship between intersex and exposure to estrogenic endocrine active contaminants (EACs) was assessed for 2 genera of sport fish, Micropterus and Lepomis, at 20 riverine sites. Seasonal trends and relationships between EACs and intersex (prevalence and severity) were examined at varying putative sources of EACs throughout North Carolina, identified as point sources, nonpoint sources, and reference sites. Intersex was identified in both genera, which was documented for the first time in wild-caught Lepomis. Intersex was more prevalent (59.8%) and more severe (1.6 mean rank) inMicropterus, which was highly correlation to EACs in sediment. In contrast, intersex was less common (9.9%) and less severe (0.2 mean rank) in Lepomis and was highly correlated to EACs in the water column. The authors found that concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, industrial EACs, and estrogens were highest at point source sites; however, no source type variation was identified in the prevalence or severity of intersex, nor were there seasonal trends in intersex or EAC concentrations. The authors' results associate genus-specific prevalence of intersex with specific EAC classes in common sport fishes having biological, ecological, and conservation implications. (C) 2016 SETAC

TI METABOLOMIC RESPONSES TO SUBLETHAL CONTAMINANT EXPOSURE IN NEONATE AND

AB The use of consumer products and pharmaceuticals that act as contaminants entering waterways through runoff and wastewater effluents alters aquatic ecosystem health. Traditional toxicological endpoints may underestimate the toxicity of contaminants, as lethal concentrations are often orders of magnitude higher than those found within freshwater ecosystems. While newer techniques examine the metabolic responses of sublethal contaminant exposure, there has been no direct comparison with ontogeny in Daphnia. It was hypothesized that Daphnia magna would have distinct metabolic changes after 3 different sublethal contaminant exposures, because of differences in the toxic mode of action and ontogeny. To test this hypothesis, the proton nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomic profiles were measured in D. magna aged day 0 and 18 after exposure to 28% of the lethal concentration of 50% of organisms tested (LC50) of atrazine, propranolol, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) for 48 h. Principal component analysis revealed significant separation of contaminants from the control daphnids in both neonates and adults exposed to propranolol and PFOS. In contrast, atrazine exposure caused separation from the controls in only the adult D. magna. Minimal ontogenetic changes in the targeted metabolites were seen after exposure to propranolol. For both atrazine and PFOS exposures ontogeny exhibited unique changes in the targeted metabolites. These results indicate that, depending on the contaminant studied, neonates and adults respond uniquely to sublethal contaminant exposure. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The authors discuss the geochemical behavior of arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), and selenium (Se) in urban gardens and the human health implications associated with urban agriculture. A total of 42 samples from 7 urban gardens in Madrid, Spain, were collected from the top 20cm of soil. Concentrations of As, Sb, and Se and the main soil properties (i.e., total iron, pH, texture, calcium carbonate, and organic matter) were determined. A significant correlation was found between As and Sb and calcium carbonate, indicating the possibility of surface adsorption or ligand exchange with the carbonate group. Also, Sb seemed to form stable chelates with soil organic matter. On the other hand, Se showed a significant association with clay and iron content. The concentration of Sb in soil exceeded the recommended value for agricultural use in 70% of the urban gardens. A human health risk assessment resulted in acceptable levels of both noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks (although with elevated values of the latter), with As as the main risk driver and soil and food ingestion as the main exposure pathways. The numerical results of the risk assessment should be interpreted with caution given the considerable uncertainties in some exposure variables and the lack of quantitative values for the suspected carcinogenicity of Sb and Se.

AB Most catchments discharging into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon have elevated loads of suspended sediment, nutrients, and pesticides, including photosystem II inhibiting herbicides, associated with upstream agricultural land use. To investigate potential impacts of declining water quality on fish physiology, RNA sequencing (RNASeq) was used to characterize and compare the hepatic transcriptomes of barramundi (Lates calcarifer) captured from 2 of these tropical river catchments in Queensland, Australia. The Daintree and Tully Rivers differ in upstream land uses, as well as sediment, nutrient, and pesticide loads, with the area of agricultural land use and contaminant loads lower in the Daintree. In fish collected from the Tully River, transcripts involved in fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and citrate cycling were also more abundant, suggesting elevated circulating cortisol concentrations, whereas transcripts involved in immune responses were less abundant. Fish from the Tully also had an increased abundance of transcripts associated with xenobiotic metabolism. Previous laboratory-based studies observed similar patterns in fish and amphibians exposed to the agricultural herbicide atrazine. If these transcriptomic patterns are manifested at the whole organism level, the differences in water quality between the 2 rivers may alter fish growth and fitness.

AB Environmental contamination is suggested to contribute to amphibian population declines. However, the effects of a contaminant on a particular amphibian species can differ among populations. The authors investigated the toxic effects of 2 herbicide formulations on different populations and on representative developmental stages of the European common frog (Rana temporaria). Larvae from forest populations were more sensitive to a commonly used glyphosate-based herbicide compared with individuals from agrarian land. Median lethal concentrations correlated with measured glyphosate levels in the breeding ponds, which may be a sign of evolved tolerances. The reverse result was observed for a less commonly used cycloxydim-based herbicide. Effects of the glyphosate-based herbicide were stronger for earlier larval stages compared with later larval stages. Hence, applications in early spring (when early larvae are present in breeding ponds) pose greater risk concerning acute toxic effects on R. temporaria. With regard to late larval stages, short exposure (96h) of prometamorphic larvae prolonged time to metamorphosis, but only at the highest test concentration that did not significantly induce mortality. This could be due to impairment of the thyroid axis. Notably, nearly all test concentrations of the 2 herbicides provoked growth retardation. Further research on how evolved or induced tolerances are acquired, actual contamination levels of amphibian habitats, and potential endocrine effects of glyphosate-based herbicides is necessary.

AB Reptiles are an underrepresented taxon in ecotoxicological literature, and the means by which toxicants play a role in population declines are only partially understood. Among the contaminants of interest for reptiles are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a class of organic compounds that is already a concern for numerous other taxa. The objectives of the present review are to summarize the existing literature on reptilian exposure to PAHs and synthesize general conclusions, to identify knowledge gaps within this niche of research, and to suggest future directions for research. Results confirm a relative scarcity of information on reptilian exposure to PAHs, although research continues to grow, particularly after significant contamination events. The orders Testudines and Squamata are better represented than the orders Crocodilia and Rhynchocephalia. For the taxonomic orders with relevant literature (all but Rhynchocephalia), some species are more frequently represented than others. Few studies establish solid cause-effect relationships after reptilian exposure to PAHs, and many more studies are suggestive of effect or increased risk of effect. Despite the scarcity of information in this area, researchers have already employed a wide variety of approaches to address PAH-related questions for reptiles, including molecular techniques, modeling, and field surveys. As more research is completed, a thoughtful interpretation of available and emerging data is necessary to make the most effective use of this information. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:25-35.

AB Equilibrium sampling based on silicone polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has been used to determine the concentrations of freely dissolved hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) and assess the thermodynamic potentials for bioaccumulation of these compounds in the aquatic environment. This allows the use of PDMS-based sampling techniques in assisting conventional sampling and extraction methods for the determination of the concentrations of HOCs in aquaculture products. The present study is an ex situ demonstration of how well PDMS can inform the tissue residues and dietary risks of legacy or current-use organic chemicals in aquaculture species from farm ponds in eastern China. For legacy contaminants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs, n = 10), good agreement between the predicted concentrations based on PDMS and the measured lipid-normalized concentrations was observed for 60% of the studied biota, including both pelagic and benthic species. For pesticides currently used, such as pyrethroid (PE) (n = 4) and organophosphate pesticides (OPPs, n = 7), the measured tissue residues were consistently higher than those predicted by PDMS, possibly caused by the continuous input from the surroundings. For the organochlorine pesticides (OCPs, n = 5), the only detected chemical was also underestimated. Adjusted by ingestion rates of aquaculture products and toxicology data, the target hazard quotients of these chemicals predicted from PDMS were generally comparable to those derived from measured concentrations in tissue because of the predominance of PBDEs. Overall, PDMS-based equilibrium sampling offered an alternative approach for the prediction of tissue residues and dietary risks of PBDEs. Moreover, it should be applied with caution for PEs, OPPs, and OCPs. Improving the application of PDMS for these chemicals in farm ponds warrants future study. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-9.

Most studies have investigated short-term responses of organisms to unrealistically high concentrations of pesticides; however, chronic exposure to persistent low concentrations, which are more likely to occur in the environment, are rarely analyzed. We tested the response of polyps of the moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita to environmental concentrations of the herbicide atrazine and the insecticide chlorpyrifos, individually and in combination, over 9 wk. We hypothesized that exposure to individual pesticides would reduce rates of asexual reproduction and alter polyps' metabolite profiles, and that the results would be more severe when polyps were exposed to the combined pesticides. Polyps survived and reproduced (through budding) in all treatments, and no differences among treatments were observed. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed no difference in profiles of polar metabolites of polyps exposed to the individual or combined pesticides. Our results suggest that A. aurita polyps are unaffected by chronic exposure to atrazine and chlorpyrifos at concentrations recommended as being protective by current Australian water quality guidelines.

AB Elevated nitrate (NO3) and sulfate (SO4) in surface water are of global concern, and studies are needed to generate toxicity data to develop environmental guideline values for NO3 and SO4. The present study was designed to fill existing gaps in toxicity databases by determining the acute and/or chronic toxicity of NO3 (tested as NaNO3) to a unionid mussel (Lampsilis siliquoidea), a midge (Chironomus dilutus), a fish (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss), and 2 amphibians (Hyla versicolor and Lithobates sylvaticus), and to determine the acute and/or chronic toxicity of SO4 (tested as Na2SO4) to 2 unionid mussels (L. siliquoidea and Villosa iris), an amphipod (Hyalella azteca), and 2 fish species (fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas and O. mykiss). Among the different test species, acute NO3 median effect concentrations (EC50s) ranged from 189 to >883 mg NO3-N/L, and chronic NO3 20% effect concentrations (EC20s) based on the most sensitive endpoint ranged from 9.6 to 47 mg NO3-N/L. The midge was the most sensitive species, and the trout was the least sensitive species in both acute and chronic NO3 exposures. Acute SO4 EC50s for the 2 mussel species (2071 and 2064 mg SO4/L) were similar to the EC50 for the amphipod (2689 mg SO4/L), whereas chronic EC20s for the 2 mussels (438 and 384 mg SO4/L) were >2-fold lower than the EC20 of the amphipod (1111 mg SO4/L), indicating the high sensitivity of mussels in chronic SO4 exposures. However, the fathead minnow, with an EC20 of 374 mg SO4/L, was the most sensitive species in chronic SO4 exposures whereas the rainbow trout was the least sensitive species (EC20 > 3240 mg SO4/L). The high sensitivity of fathead minnow was consistent with the finding in a previous chronic Na2SO4 study. However, the EC20 values from the present study conducted in test water containing a higher potassium concentration (3 mg K/L) were >2-fold greater than those in the previous study at a lower potassium concentration (1 mg K/L), which confirmed the influence of potassium on chronic Na2SO4 toxicity to the minnow.

AB Benzotriazole ultraviolet-stabilizers (BZT-UVs) are commonly used as additives to protect from light-induced degradation in a variety of consumer goods. Despite their widespread presence in aquatic ecosystems, information on the effects of these compounds remains largely unknown. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the chronic effects of 2 BZT-UVs alone and in a mixture, 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-bis(1-methyl-1-phenylethyl)phenol (UV-234) and 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-di-tert-pentylphenol (UV-328), in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) chronically exposed (for 28 d) through the diet. Chemical analyses of livers from exposed trout suggested liver accumulation and potential metabolism of the 2 compounds. Hepatic RNA-sequencing analyses revealed specific effects of each compound on gene transcription profiles; UV-234 affected mainly genes involved in cellular metabolism, whereas UV-328 induced the transcription of ribosomal proteins and downregulated genes involved in immune responses. Both compounds regulated iron homeostasis genes in an opposite manner. The mixture of both BZT-UVs did not produce significant evidence of additive or synergistic effects.

AB Predictive approaches to assessing the toxicity of contaminant mixtures have been largely limited to chemicals that exert effects through the same biological molecular initiating event. However, by understanding specific pathways through which chemicals exert effects, it may be possible to identify shared "downstream" nodes as the basis for forecasting interactive effects of chemicals with different molecular initiating events. Adverse outcome pathway (AOP) networks conceptually support this type of analysis. We assessed the utility of a simple AOP network for predicting the effects of mixtures of an aromatase inhibitor (fadrozole) and an androgen receptor agonist (17 beta-trenbolone) on aspects of reproductive endocrine function in female fathead minnows. The fish were exposed to multiple concentrations of fadrozole and 17 beta-trenbolone individually or in combination for 48 or 96 h. Effects on 2 shared nodes in the AOP network, plasma 17 beta-estradiol (E2) concentration and vitellogenin (VTG) production (measured as hepatic vtg transcripts) responded as anticipated to fadrozole alone but were minimally impacted by 17 beta-trenbolone alone. Overall, there were indications that 17 beta-trenbolone enhanced decreases in E2 and vtg in fadrozole-exposed fish, as anticipated, but the results often were not statistically significant. Failure to consistently observe hypothesized interactions between fadrozole and 17 beta-trenbolone could be due to several factors, including lack of impact of 17 beta-trenbolone, inherent biological variability in the endpoints assessed, and/or an incomplete understanding of interactions (including feedback) between different pathways within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.

AB Toxic effects of selenium (Se) contamination in freshwaters have been well documented. However, study of Se contamination has focused on lentic and larger order lotic systems, whereas headwater streams have received little scrutiny. In central Appalachia, surface coal mining is a common Se source to headwater streams, thus providing a useful system to investigate Se bioaccumulation in headwater food chains and possible longitudinal patterns in Se concentrations. Toward that end, we assessed Se bioaccumulation in 2 reference and 4 mining-influenced headwater streams. At each stream, we sampled ecosystem media, including streamwater, particulate matter (sediment, biofilm, leaf detritus), benthic macroinvertebrates, salamanders, and fish, every 400 m along 1.2- and 1.6-km reaches. We compared media Se concentrations within and among streams and evaluated longitudinal trends in media Se concentrations. Selenium concentrations in sampled media were higher in mining-influenced streams compared with reference streams. We found the highest Se concentrations in benthic macroinvertebrates; however, salamanders and fish bioaccumulated Se to potentially harmful levels in mining-influenced streams. Only one stream demonstrated dilution of streamwater Se with distance downstream, and few longitudinal patterns in Se bioaccumulation occurred along our study reaches. Collectively, our results provide a field-based assessment of Se bioaccumulation in headwater food chains, from streamwater to fish, and highlight the need for future assessments of Se effects in headwater streams and receiving downstream waters.

AB A study was performed to evaluate the potential biological impacts from 8 different miscellaneous discharges from an oil and gas mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) including deck drainage, desalination unit waste, boiler blowdown, fire control system test water, noncontact cooling water, and bilge water. Samples were evaluated for toxicity using a rapid (<1 h) initial screening test (echinoderm [Dendraster excentricus] fertilization test), and if toxicity was found, further testing was conducted using 3 chronic whole-effluent toxicity tests. This additional testing included the embryo larval development 72-h echinoderm (D. excentricus); 7-d mysid (Americamysis bahia) survival, growth, and fecundity invertebrate test; and 7-d topsmelt (Atherinops affinis) survival and growth fish test. Toxicity identification evaluations were performed on 3 discharges that consistently elicited a toxic response during whole-effluent toxicity testing. To place the results of the toxicity testing into the context of environmental risk, the spatial extent of potential biological effects was investigated using the CORMIX mixing zone model. The output of the modeling indicated that discharge of selected effluents did not result in concentrations, or duration of exposure, that would elicit toxic effects to organisms living in the surrounding environment. The present study provides a comprehensive data set that was used to characterize potential toxicity and environmental risk of MODU "miscellaneous discharges" which could help inform future risk assessments of these discharges.

AB Amphibians are declining worldwide, in part because of large-scale degradation of habitat from agriculture and pervasive pathogens. Yet a common North American amphibian, the wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus), ranges widely and persists in agricultural landscapes. Conventional survey techniques rely on visual encounters and dip-netting efforts, but detectability limits the ability to test for the effects of environmental variables on amphibian habitat suitability. We used environmental DNA to determine the presence of wood frogs and an amphibian pathogen (ranavirus) in Prairie Pothole wetlands and investigated the effects of 32 water quality, wetland habitat, and landscape-level variables on frog presence at sites representing different degrees of agricultural intensity. Several wetland variables influenced wood frog presence, the most influential being those associated with wetland productivity (i.e., nutrients), vegetation buffer width, and proportion of the surrounding landscape that is comprised of other water bodies. Wood frog presence was positively associated with higher dissolved phosphorus (>0.4 mg/L), moderate dissolved nitrogen (0.1-0.2 mg/L), lower chlorophyll a (<= 15 mu g/L), wider vegetation buffers (>= 10 m), and more water on the landscape (>= 0.25). These results highlight the effects of environmental factors at multiple scales on the presence of amphibians in this highly modified landscape-namely the importance of maintaining wetland water quality, vegetation buffers, and surrounding habitat heterogeneity.

AB Ecological risk assessments are hampered by limited availability of ecotoxicity data. The present study aimed to explore the possibility of deriving species sensitivity distribution (SSD) parameters for nontested compounds, based on simple physicochemical characteristics, known SSDs for data-rich compounds, and a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)-type approach. The median toxicity of a data-poor chemical for species assemblages significantly varies with values of the physicochemical descriptors, especially when based on high-quality SSD data (from either acute median effect concentrations or chronic no-observed-effect concentrations). Beyond exploratory uses, we discuss how the precision of QSAR-based SSDs can be improved to construct models that accurately predict the SSD parameters of data-poor chemicals. The current models show that the concept of QSAR-based SSDs supports screening-level evaluations of the potential ecotoxicity of compounds for which data are lacking.

AB There is growing interest in developing alternative methods to screen and prioritize chemical hazards, although few studies have compared responses across different methods. The objective of the present study was to compare 3 alternative liver methods derived from white Leghorn chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus): primary hepatocyte culture, liver slices, and liver from in ovo injected embryos. We examined hepatic gene expression changes after exposure to 3 chemicals (17 beta-trenbolone [17 beta T], 17 beta-estradiol [E2], and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin [TCDD]) using a custom quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) array with 7 genes (vitellogenin [VTG], apolipoprotein [Apo], cytochrome P450 1A4 [CYP1A4], liver basic fatty acid binding protein [LBFABP], 3 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [HSD3 beta 1], stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase [SCD], and estrogen sulfotransferase [SULT1E1]). Gene expression across the 3 methods was examined using hierarchical clustering. Up-regulation of CYP1A4 in response to TCDD was consistent across all methods, and the magnitude was higher in hepatocytes (>150-fold) compared with slices (>31-fold) and in ovo liver (>27-fold). In hepatocytes, SCD and VTG up-regulation in response to 17 beta T and E2 was >4-fold and 16-fold, respectively. The rank order of cases with significant changes in gene expression among the 3 methods was: hepatocytes (22) > in ovo liver (11) > liver slices (6). Hierarchical clustering grouped liver slices and in ovo liver as more similar, whereas hepatocytes were grouped separately from in ovo liver. More introspective comparisons are needed to understand how and why alternative methods differ and to aid in their integration into toxicity testing. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2546-2555.

AB Copper (Cu) is an essential trace metal, but may also be toxic to aquatic organisms. Although many studies have investigated the cytotoxicity of Cu, little is known about the in vivo genotoxic potential of Cu in marine invertebrates. We investigated the genotoxicity of Cu in 2 pelagic calanoid copepods, Acartia tonsa and Temora longicornis, and the intertidal harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus brevicornis by exposing them for 6 and 72 h to waterborne Cu (0, 6, and 60 mu g Cu/L). A subsequent 24-h period in filtered seawater was used to investigate delayed effects or recovery. Genotoxicity was evaluated as DNA strand breaks in individual copepods using the comet assay. Copper did not increase DNA strand breaks in any of the species at any concentration or time point. The treatment did, however, cause 100% mortality in A. tonsa following exposure to 60 mu g Cu/L. Acartia tonsa and T. longicornis were more susceptible to Cu-induced mortality than the benthic harpacticoid T. brevicornis, which appeared to be unaffected by the treatments. The results show major differences in Cu susceptibility among the 3 copepods and also that acute toxicity of Cu to A. tonsa is not directly associated with genotoxicity. We also show that the comet assay can be used to quantify genotoxicity in individual copepods. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2224-2232. (c) 2019 SETAC.

AB Laboratory testing of sediments frequently involves manipulation by amendment with contaminants and homogenization, which changes the physicochemical structure of sediments. These changes can influence the bioavailability of divalent metals, and field and mesocosm experiments have shown that laboratory-derived thresholds are often overly conservative. We assessed the mechanisms that lead to divergence between laboratory- and field-derived thresholds; specifically, we assessed the importance of slow equilibration to solid-phase ligands and vertical stratification. To mimic natural physicochemical conditions, we uniquely aged sediment with a flow-through exposure system. These sediments were then homogenized and compared, toxicologically, with freshly metal-amended sediments in a 28-d chronic toxicity bioassay with the amphipod Hyalella azteca. We assessed concentration-response relationships for 3 metals (copper, nickel, and zinc) and 5 geochemically distinct sediments. We observed minimal differences in growth and survival of H. azteca between aged and freshly spiked sediments across all sediments and metals. These trends suggest that a loss of toxicity observed during long-term sediment aging is reversed after sediment homogenization. By comparison with mesocosm experiments, we demonstrate that homogenizing sediment immediately before toxicity assays may produce artificially high toxicity thresholds. We suggest that toxicity assays with sediments that maintain vertical redox gradients are needed to generate field-relevant sediment metal toxicity thresholds. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-13.

AB Tank mixtures are popular within the agricultural community because they are time- and cost-effective, but field applications leave nontarget organisms at risk of exposure. We explored the effects of a common herbicide (atrazine and alachlor) and fertilizer (urea) tank mixture on juvenile frog corticosterone stress levels, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and pesticide bioaccumulation. Single agrochemical or tank mixtures were applied to terrestrial microcosms, and then individual Southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephala) juveniles were added to microcosms for an 8-h exposure. Afterward, frogs were transferred to aquatic microcosms for 1 h to monitor corticosterone prior to euthanasia, brain tissues were excised to evaluate AChE, and tissue homogenates were analyzed for pesticide bioconcentation with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Atrazine significantly increased corticosterone in frogs, particularly when combined with alachlor and urea. Atrazine increased AChE and urea decreased AChE, although no interactive effects of chemical combinations were discernible. Relative to their individual treatments, the complete tank mixture with all 3 agrochemicals resulted in 64% greater bioconcentration of atrazine and 54% greater bioconcentration of alachlor in frog tissues. Our results suggest that agrochemical mixtures as well as their active ingredients can lead to altered stress levels and impaired physiological responses in amphibians. An improved understanding of the effects of co-exposure to environmental contaminants in amphibians is important in assessing the ecological risks these compounds pose.

AB Sources of lead exposure of many bird species are poorly understood. We analyzed blood lead concentrations from osprey (n = 244; Pandion haliaetus) and bald eagles (n = 68; Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and documented potential sources of lead they may encounter. Adult bald eagles had higher blood lead concentrations than did adult osprey. However, blood lead concentrations of nestlings were similar for both species. Although 62% of osprey had detectable lead concentrations (x over bar = 1.99 +/- 4.02 mu g/dL, mean +/- standard deviation [SD]), there was no difference in the detection frequency or lead concentrations between osprey adults and nestlings. Likewise, we found no differences in the detection frequency or lead concentrations in osprey adults and nestlings from high- and low-salinity areas. Of the bald eagle samples tested, 55% had detectable lead levels (x over bar = 6.23 +/- 10.74 mu g/dL). Adult bald eagles had more detectable and higher lead concentrations than did nestlings or pre-adults. Among environmental samples, paint had the highest lead concentrations, followed by sediment, blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus), and gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum). There was no correlation between blood lead concentrations of osprey adults and their offspring. Our results indicate that, in the Chesapeake Bay region of Maryland and Virginia (USA), there are multiple sources by which piscivorous raptors may be exposed to lead.

AB Non-anadromous forms of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), those that are restricted to lakes and rivers, typically have higher mercury (Hg) concentrations than anadromous forms, which migrate to and from the sea. Using tissue burden data from the literature and our own analyses, we performed a screening-level risk assessment of methylmercury (MeHg) for non-anadromous Arctic char. Our assessment included 1569 fish distributed across 83 sites. Site-specific mean total Hg concentrations in non-anadromous Arctic char muscle varied considerably from 0.01 to 1.13 mu g/g wet weight, with 21% (17 of 83 sites) meeting or exceeding a threshold-effect level in fish of 0.33 mu g/g wet weight, and 13% (11 of 83 sites) meeting or exceeding a threshold-effect level in fish of 0.5 mu g/g wet weight. Of the sites in exceedance of the 0.33-mu g/g threshold, 7 were located in Greenland and 10 in Canada (Labrador, Nunavut, and Yukon). All but one of these sites were located in interfrost or permafrost biomes. Maximum total Hg concentrations exceeded 0.33 mu g/g wet weight at 53% of sites (40 of the 75 sites with available maximum Hg values), and exceeded 0.5 mu g/g wet weight at 27% (20 of 75 sites). Collectively, these results indicate that certain populations of non-anadromous Arctic char located mainly in interfrost and permafrost regions may be at risk for MeHg toxicity. This approach provides a simple statistical assessment of MeHg risk to non-anadromous Arctic char, and does not indicate actual effects. We highlight the need for studies that evaluate the potential toxic effects of MeHg in non-anadromous Arctic char, as well as those that aid in the development of a MeHg toxic-effect threshold specific to this species of fish.

AB The temporal expansion of harmful algal blooms, primarily associated with cyanobacteria, may impact aquatic organisms at vulnerable life-history stages. Broadcast spawning species release gametes into the water column for external fertilization, directly exposing sperm to potential aquatic stressors. To determine if cyanobacteria can disrupt reproduction in freshwater broadcast spawners, we evaluated sublethal effects of cyanobacteria exposure on quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) sperm. In laboratory studies, sperm were collected after inducing mussels to spawn using serotonin and exposed to 11 cultures of cyanobacteria including Anabaena flos-aquae, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Dolichospermum lemmermannii, Gloeotrichia echinulata, 5 cultures of Microcystis aeruginosa, M. wesenbergii, and Planktothrix suspensa. Sperm motility, using endpoints of cumulative distance traveled and mean velocity, was calculated for a minimum of 10 individual sperm using a novel optical biotracking assay method. The distance and velocity at which sperm traveled decreased when exposed to Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and 2 M. aeruginosa cultures. Our findings indicate that cyanobacteria impede the motility of quagga mussel sperm, which can potentially result in reproductive impairments to mussels and potentially other broadcast spawning species.

AB Oil spill response requires consideration of several countermeasures including chemical dispersants, but their potential toxicity to aquatic species poses a concern. Considerable in vivo aquatic toxicity data from laboratory exposures have been generated since 2010 for current-use dispersants. The objective of the present review is to provide a synthesis of these data to improve dispersant hazard assessments. Data from multiple studies were evaluated based on reliability criteria. Although procedures, standards, endpoints, and statistical approaches were usually described, nearly a quarter of sources did not provide sufficient information to judge study quality but were considered on a case-by-case basis. Data were used to develop dispersant-specific species sensitivity distributions and hazard concentrations protective of 95% of the species (HC5). Given data limitations, post-2010 toxicity data were augmented with pre-2010 data and model predictions. The HC5s calculated for 54 dispersants fell mostly within the moderate to slightly toxic range and were compared to field dispersant-only concentrations estimated from operational application rates under conservative assumptions. Based on available evidence, dispersants may not pose a significant risk under field conditions to most aquatic species, if proper application and dilution are taken into account. Recommendations on improved toxicity testing and reporting as well as research needs are also provided. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2989-3001. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB The potential impact of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) on aquatic organisms is to a large extent determined by their bioavailability through different routes of exposure. In the present study juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were exposed to different sources of radiolabeled Ag (radiolabeled Ag-110m NPs and (AgNO3)-Ag-110m). After 48h of waterborne exposure to 3g/L citrate stabilized Ag-110m NPs or (AgNO3)-Ag-110m, or a dietary exposure to 0.6mg Ag/kg fish (given as citrate stabilized or uncoated Ag-110m NPs, or (AgNO3)-Ag-110m), Ag had been taken up in fish regardless of route of exposure or source of Ag (Ag NPs or AgNO3). Waterborne exposure led to high Ag concentrations on the gills, and dietary exposure led to high concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract. Silver distribution to the target organs was similar for both dietary and waterborne exposure, with the liver as the main target organ. The accumulation level of Ag was 2 to 3 times higher for AgNO3 than for Ag NPs when exposure was through water, whereas no significant differences were seen after dietary exposure. The transfer (Bq/g liver/g food or water) from exposure through water was 4 orders of magnitude higher than from feed using the smallest, citrate-stabilized Ag NPs (4nm). The smallest NPs had a 5 times higher bioavailability in food compared with the larger and uncoated Ag NPs (20nm). Despite the relatively low transfer of Ag from diet to fish, the short lifetime of Ag NPs in water and their transfer to sediment, feed, or sediment-dwelling food sources such as larvae and worms could make diet a significant long-term exposure route.

AB Little is known about how design and testing methodologies affect the macroinvertebrate communities that are held captive in mesocosms. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a 32-d test to determine how seeded invertebrate communities changed once removed from the natural stream and introduced to the laboratory. We evaluated larvae survival and adult emergence in controls from 4 subsequent studies, as well as corresponding within-river community changes. The experimental streams maintained about 80% of the invertebrates that originally colonized the introduced substrates. Many macroinvertebrate populations experienced changes in numbers through time, suggesting that these taxa are unlikely to maintain static populations throughout studies. For example, some taxa (Tanytarsini, Simuliidae, Cinygmula sp.) increased in number, grew (Simuliidae), and possibly recruited new individuals (Baetidae) as larvae, while several also completed other life history events (pupation and emergence) during the 30- to 32-d studies. Midges and mayflies dominated emergence, further supporting the idea that conditions are conducive for many taxa to complete their life cycles while held captive in the experimental streams. However, plecopterans were sensitive to temperature changes >2 degrees C between river and laboratory. Thus, this experimental stream testing approach can support diverse larval macroinvertebrate communities for durations consistent with some chronic criterion development and life cycle assessments (i.e., 30d). The changes in communities held captive in the experimental streams were mostly consistent with the parallel changes observed from in situ river samples, indicating that mesocosm results are reasonably representative of real river insect communities.

AB Nanoclays represent a class of natural and modified nanomaterials that have received attention from industrial and environmental fields. Studies that assess the physicochemical properties of nanoclays and compare the effects of natural and modified nanoclays are scarce. We assessed the physicochemical characteristics of a natural nanoclay (Na+ montmorillonite) and 2 modified nanoclays (Cloisite (R) 30B and Novaclay) in the dry powder state and in solution, and their potential toxic effects on algal population growth (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii). All 3 nanoclays exhibited properties that are thought to cause toxic effects on organisms, but the properties varied among the nanoclays. Cloisite 30B had a low particle stability and a chemical composition that are thought to induce a greater toxic effect on organisms than either Novaclay or natural nanoclay. In contrast, Novaclay and natural nanoclay had a particle shape (nanoplate) in solution that is thought to induce a greater toxic effect on organisms than the type of particle shape (spherical) that Cloisite 30B has in solution. Cloisite 30B suppressed population growth of C. reinhardtii, an effect that increased with dosage. Neither Novaclay nor natural nanoclay affected algal population growth across a broad array of concentrations. The results show that modified nanoclays differ in their impact on algae, and careful thought must be given to their usage because some will have negative consequences if released into aquatic ecosystems.

AB Widespread use of pesticides often contaminates natural habitats, exposing nontarget organisms to pesticides that were designed to control pest populations. Even low levels of pesticides can affect aquatic communities both directly and indirectly. Previous work has shown that trace amounts of the pesticide chlorpyrifos altered tadpole morphology and neurodevelopment in artificial ponds (mesocosms). To determine whether effects resulted from direct chlorpyrifos exposure or from disruption of the food web due to a pesticide-induced decline in zooplankton, we examined the impacts of chlorpyrifos on amphibian development in the presence of chlorpyrifos-resistant zooplankton, a key component of the aquatic trophic community. Northern leopard frog (Lithobates pipiens) tadpoles were reared through metamorphosis in mesocosms containing either 0 or 1 mu g/L chlorpyrifos and either chlorpyrifos-resistant or chlorpyrifos-sensitive Daphnia pulex zooplankton. Developmental exposure to chlorpyrifos resulted in metamorphs with a relatively wider optic tectum, medulla, and diencephalon compared with controls, and this result was found regardless of the zooplankton population within the mesocosm. Thus, chlorpyrifos directly impacted brain development, independent of the effects on the trophic community. With respect to body shape, chlorpyrifos had no effect on body shape of metamorphs reared in mesocosms with chlorpyrifos-sensitive zooplankton, but body shape was sensitive to zooplankton population in the absence of chlorpyrifos. To conclude, low, ecologically relevant doses of organophosphorous pesticides can directly impact neurodevelopment in a vertebrate model. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2692-2698. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Neonicotinoid insecticides are frequently detected in surface waters near agricultural areas, leading to a potential for chronic exposure to sensitive aquatic species. The midge Chironomus dilutus and the mayfly Neocloeon triangulifer have been shown to be acutely sensitive to neonicotinoids. Previous studies have established chronic effects of some neonicotinoids on C. dilutus, but reproduction has not been studied. Toxic effects have not been assessed using N. triangulifer. We present the results of chronic, static-renewal tests for 6 neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) with C. dilutus (56-d in length) and N. triangulifer (32-d in length). Emergence was generally the most sensitive endpoint for both species across all neonicotinoids. Effect concentrations, 10% (EC10s; emergence) were 0.03 to 1.1gL(-1) for acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiacloprid. Dinotefuran and thiamethoxam were less potent, with EC10s (C. dilutus) or median effect concentrations (EC50s; N. triangulifer) of 2.2 to 11.2gL(-1). Hazard was assessed through comparison of neonicotinoid environmental concentrations from agricultural surface waters in Ontario (Canada) with either the 5th percentile hazard concentration (for imidacloprid) or species-specific EC10s from the present study (for all remaining neonicotinoids). The resulting hazard quotients (HQs) indicated little to no hazard (HQ <1) in terms of chronic toxicity for acetamiprid, dinotefuran, thiacloprid, or thiamethoxam. A moderate hazard (HQ >1) was found for emergence of N. triangulifer for clothianidin, and a high hazard (HQ=74) was found for imidacloprid. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2727-2739. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Species with complex life cycles are susceptible to environmental stressors across life stages, but the carryover and latent effects between stages remain understudied. For species with biphasic life histories, such as pond-breeding amphibians, delayed effects of aquatic conditions can influence terrestrial juveniles and adults directly or indirectly, usually mediated through fitness correlates such as body size. We collected adult southern toads (Anaxyrus terrestris) from 2 source populationsa natural reference wetland and a metal-contaminated industrial wetlandand exposed their offspring to 2 aquatic stressors (a metal contaminant, copper [Cu], and a dragonfly predator cue) in outdoor mesocosms (n=24). We then reared metamorphs in terraria for 5 mo to examine delayed effects of early life stage environmental conditions on juvenile performance, growth, and survival. Larval exposure to Cu, as well as having parents from a contaminated wetland, resulted in smaller size at metamorphosisa response later negated by compensatory growth. Although Cu exposure and parental source did not affect larval survival, we observed latent effects of these stressors on juvenile survival, with elevated Cu conditions and metal-contaminated parents reducing postmetamorphic survival. Parental source and larval Cu exposure affected performance at metamorphosis through carryover effects on body size but, 1 mo later, latent effects of parental source and larval predator exposure directly (i.e., not via body size) influenced performance. The carryover and latent effects of parental source population and aquatic Cu level on postmetamorphic survival and juvenile performance highlight the importance of conducting studies across life stages and generations.

AB Seasonal aquatic insect emergence represents a critical subsidy link between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Early and late instar larvae developing in wetlands near neonicotinoid-treated cropland can be at risk of chronic insecticide exposure. In the present study, an in situ wetland limnocorral experiment compared emergent insect community responses to imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam. Twenty-one limnocorrals were dosed weekly for 9 wk to target peak nominal doses of 0.0, 0.05, or 0.5g/L, followed by a 6-wk recovery period. Thirty-nine aquatic insect taxa were recorded but 11 taxa groups made up 97% of the community composition. Principal response curves (PRCs) indicated that during the dosing period, community composition among the treatments resembled the controls. During the 6-wk recovery period, significant deviance was observed in the high imidacloprid treatment with similar trends in the clothianidin treatment, suggesting that community effects from neonicotinoid exposure can be delayed. Non-biting midges (Diptera: Chironomidae) and damselflies (Odonata: Zygoptera) emerged 18 to 25 d earlier than controls in the imidacloprid and clothianidin neonicotinoid treatments, with no effects from thiamethoxam treatments. These data suggest that phenology and subtle community effects can occur at measured neonicotinoid concentrations of 0.045 (imidacloprid) and 0.038g/L (clothianidin) under chronic repeated exposure conditions. Synchronization and community dynamics are critical to aquatic insects and consumers; thus, neonicotinoids may have broad implications for wetland ecosystem function.

AB Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are major sources of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and other chemicals of toxicological concern for the aquatic environment. In the present study, we used an integrated strategy combining passive sampling (Chemcatcher (R)), developmental toxicity, and mechanism-based in vitro and in vivo bioassays to monitor the impacts of a WWTP on a river. In vitro screening revealed the WWTP effluent as a source of estrogen, glucocorticoid, and aryl hydrocarbon (AhR) receptor-mediated activities impacting the downstream river site where significant activities were also measured, albeit to a lesser extent than in the effluent. Effect-directed analysis of the effluent successfully identified the presence of potent estrogens (estrone, 17-ethinylestradiol, and 17-estradiol) and glucocorticoids (clobetasol propionate and fluticasone propionate) as the major contributors to the observed in vitro activities, even though other unidentified active chemicals were likely present. The impact of the WWTP was also assessed using zebrafish embryo assays, highlighting its ability to induce estrogenic response through up-regulation of the aromatase promoter-dependent reporter gene in the transgenic (cyp19a1b-green fluorescent protein [GFP]) zebrafish assay and to generate teratogenic effects at nonlethal concentrations in the zebrafish embryo toxicity test. The present study argues for the use of such an integrated approach, combining passive sampling, bioassays, and effect-directed analysis, to comprehensively identify endocrine active compounds and associated hazards of WTTP effluents.

AB Since the 1980s, gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have been routinely used in magnetic resonance imaging as stable chelates of the Gd3+ ion, without toxic effects. Generally, GBCAs are considered some of the safest contrast agents. However, it has been observed that they can accumulate in patient tissue, bone, and probably brain (causing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with kidney failure or insufficiency and disturbance of calcium homeostasis in the organism). The GBCAs are predominantly removed renally without metabolization. Subsequently, they do not undergo degradation processes in wastewater-treatment plants and are emitted into the aquatic ecosystem. Their occurrence was confirmed in surface waters (up to 1100ng/L), sediments (up to 90.5g/g), and living organisms. Based on a literature review, there is a need to investigate the contamination of different ecosystems and to ascertain the environmental fate of Gd. Long-term ecotoxicological data, degradation, metabolism, bioaccumulation processes, and biochemical effects of the Gd complexes should be explored. These data can be used to assess detailed environmental risks because currently only hotspots with high levels of Gd can be marked as dangerous for aquatic environments according to environmental risk assessments.

AB It is commonly true that a diluted colloidal suspension is more stable over time than a concentrated one because dilution reduces collision rates of the particles and therefore delays the formation of aggregates. However, this generalization does not apply for some engineered ligand-coated nanoparticles (NPs). We observed the opposite relationship between stability and concentration of NPs. We tested 4 different types of NPs: CdSe-11-mercaptoundecanoic acid, CdTe-polyelectrolytes, Ag-citrate, and Ag-polyvinylpyrrolidone. The results showed that dilution alone induced aggregation and subsequent sedimentation of the NPs that were originally monodispersed at very high concentrations. Increased dilution caused NPs to progressively become unstable in the suspensions. The extent of the dilution impact on the stability of NPs is different for different types of NPs. We hypothesize that the unavoidable decrease in free ligand concentration in the aqueous phase following dilution causes detachment of ligands from the suspended NP cores. The ligands attached to NP core surfaces must generally approach exchange equilibrium with free ligands in the aqueous phase; therefore, ligand detachment and destabilization are expected consequences of dilution. More studies are necessary to test this hypothesis. Because the stability of NPs determines their physicochemical and kinetic behavior including toxicity, dilution-induced instability needs to be understood to realistically predict the behavior of engineered ligand-coated NPs in aqueous systems.

AB Environmental risk assessment of chemical mixtures is challenging because of the multitude of possible combinations that may occur. Aquatic risk from chemical mixtures in an agricultural landscape was evaluated prospectively in 2 exposure scenario case studies: at field scale for a program of 13 plant-protection products applied annually for 20 yr and at a watershed scale for a mixed land-use scenario over 30 yr with 12 plant-protection products and 2 veterinary pharmaceuticals used for beef cattle. Risk quotients were calculated from regulatory exposure models with typical real-world use patterns and regulatory acceptable concentrations for individual chemicals. The results could differentiate situations when there was concern associated with single chemicals from those when concern was associated with a mixture (based on concentration addition) with no single chemical triggering concern. Potential mixture risk was identified on 0.02 to 7.07% of the total days modeled, depending on the scenario, the taxa, and whether considering acute or chronic risk. Taxa at risk were influenced by receiving water body characteristics along with chemical use profiles and associated properties. The present study demonstrates that a scenario-based approach can be used to determine whether mixtures of chemicals pose risks over and above any identified using existing approaches for single chemicals, how often and to what magnitude, and ultimately which mixtures (and dominant chemicals) cause greatest concern.

AB Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high production volume compound primarily used to produce epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastic. Exposure to low concentrations of BPA occurs in freshwater and marine systems, primarily from wastewater treatment plant discharges. The dataset for chronic toxicity of BPA to freshwater organisms includes studies on fish, amphibians, invertebrates, algae, and aquatic plants. To broaden the dataset, a 1.5-generation test with sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus) and a full life-cycle test with mysid shrimp (Americamysis bahia) were conducted. Testing focused on apical endpoints of survival, growth and development, and reproduction. The respective no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) and lowest-observed-effect concentration (LOEC) values of 170 and 370 mu g/L for mysid and 66 and 130 mu g/L for sheepshead were based on reduced fecundity. The hazardous concentrations for 5% of the species (HC5) values of 18 mu g/L were calculated from species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) with freshwater-only data and combined freshwater and marine data. Inclusion of marine data resulted in no apparent difference in SSD shape, R-2 values for the distributions, or HC5 values. Upper-bound 95th percentile concentrations of BPA measured in marine waters of North America and Europe (0.024 and 0.15 mu g/L, respectively) are below the HC5 value of 18 mu g/L. These results suggest that marine and freshwater species are of generally similar sensitivity and that chronic studies using a diverse set of species can be combined to assess the aquatic toxicity of BPA.

AB Quantifying the transfer of organic chemicals from the environment into terrestrial plants is essential for assessing human and ecological risks, using plants as environmental contamination biomonitors, and predicting phytoremediation effectiveness. Experimental data describing chemical uptake by plants are often expressed as ratios of chemical concentrations in the plant compartments of interest (e.g., leaves, shoots, roots, xylem sap) to those in the exposure medium (e.g., soil, soil porewater, hydroponic solution, air). These ratios are generally referred to as "bioconcentration factors" but have also been named for the specific plant compartment sampled, such as "root concentration factors," "leaf concentration factors," or " transpiration stream(xylem sap) concentrations factors." We reviewed over 350 articles to develop a database with 7049 entries of measured bioaccumulation data for 310 organic chemicals and 112 terrestrial plant species. Various experimental approaches have been used; therefore, interstudy comparisons and data-quality evaluations are difficult. Key exposure and plant growth conditions were often missing, and units were often unclear or not reported. The lack of comparable high-confidence data also limits model evaluation and development. Standard test protocols or, at a minimum, standard reporting guidelines for the measurement of plant uptake data are recommended to generate comparable, high-quality data that will improve mechanistic understanding of organic chemical uptake by plants.

AB Elevated vanadium (V) concentrations in oil sands coke, which is produced and stored on site of some major Athabasca Oil Sands companies, could pose a risk to aquatic ecosystems in northern Alberta, Canada, depending on its future storage and utilization. In the present study, V toxicity was determined in reconstituted Athabasca River water to various freshwater organisms, including 2 midge species (Chironomus dilutus and Chironomus riparius; 4-d and 30-d to 40-d exposures) and 2 freshwater fish species (Oncorhynchus mykiss and Pimephales promelas; 4-d and 28-d exposures) to facilitate estimation of water quality benchmarks. The acute toxicity of V was 52.0 and 63.2mg/L for C. dilutus and C. riparius, respectively, and 4.0 and 14.8mgV/L for P. promelas and O. mykiss, respectively. Vanadium exposure significantly impaired adult emergence of C. dilutus and C. riparius at concentrations 16.7 (31.6% reduction) and 8.3 (18.0% reduction) mg/L, respectively. Chronic toxicity in fish presented as lethality, with chronic 28-d LC50s of 0.5 and 4.3mg/L for P. promelas and O. mykiss, respectively. These data were combined with data from the peer-reviewed literature, and separate acute and chronic species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) were constructed. The acute and chronic hazardous concentrations endangering only 5% of species (HC5) were estimated as 0.64 and 0.05mgV/L, respectively. These new data for V toxicity to aquatic organisms ensure that there are now adequate data available for regulatory agencies to develop appropriate water quality guidelines for use in the Athabasca Oil Sands region and elsewhere. Until then, the HC5 values presented in the present study could serve as interim benchmarks for the protection of aquatic life from exposure to hazardous levels of V in local aquatic environments.

AB Prioritization methodologies are often used for identifying those pharmaceuticals that pose the greatest risk to the natural environment and to focus laboratory testing or environmental monitoring toward pharmaceuticals of greatest concern. Risk-based prioritization approaches, employing models to derive exposure concentrations, are commonly used, but the reliability of these models is unclear. The present study evaluated the accuracy of exposure models commonly used for pharmaceutical prioritization. Targeted monitoring was conducted for 95 pharmaceuticals in the Rivers Foss and Ouse in the City of York (UK). Predicted environmental concentration (PEC) ranges were estimated based on localized prescription, hydrological data, reported metabolism, and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) removal rates, and were compared with measured environmental concentrations (MECs). For the River Foss, PECs, obtained using highest metabolism and lowest WWTP removal, were similar to MECs. In contrast, this trend was not observed for the River Ouse, possibly because of pharmaceutical inputs unaccounted for by our modeling. Pharmaceuticals were ranked by risk based on either MECs or PECs. With 2 exceptions (dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine), risk ranking based on both MECs and PECs produced similar results in the River Foss. Overall, these findings indicate that PECs may well be appropriate for prioritization of pharmaceuticals in the environment when robust and local data on the system of interest are available and reflective of most source inputs.

AB The present study characterized the chronic effect of binary-metal mixtures of cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) on Daphnia magna. The titration design was chosen to characterize the 21-d chronic effects of the binary-metal mixtures on survival, growth, reproduction, and metal accumulation in D. magna. Using this design, increasing concentrations of Zn (10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 mu g/L) were titrated against a constant concentration of 1.5 mu g/L Cd. The results demonstrated that Cd was highly toxic to D. magna. In a mixture with Cd and Zn, sublethal concentrations of 10 and 20 mu g/L Zn were insufficient to protect D. magna from chronic Cd toxicity, whereas mixtures containing 40, 80, and 120 mu g/L Zn provided strong protective effects to D. magna at all endpoints and resulted in less-than-additive effects. At higher Zn concentrations, such as 160 and 200 mu g/L, Zn appeared to contribute to the toxicity. The less-than-additive effects observed in the Cd-Zn mixture can be explained by the decrease in body Cd concentration when the Zn concentration was increased in the exposure media. Embryos analyzed for morphological alterations in the Cd-Zn mixtures demonstrated severe developmental defects. The effect of Cd on undeveloped embryos while both Zn and Cd are present in the organisms raises a question of whether the competitive binding mechanism of Zn and Cd is still happening at the cellular level in the organisms. The results of the present study are useful for development of the biotic ligand model and environmental quality guidelines for metal mixtures. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB There is consensus that fish are the most sensitive aquatic organisms to selenium(Se) and that Se concentrations in fish tissue are the most reliable indicators of potential toxicity. Differences in Se speciation, biological productivity, Se concentration, and parameters that affect Se bioavailability (e.g., sulfate) may influence the relationship between Se concentrations in water and fish tissue. It is desirable to identify environmentally protective waterborne Se guidelines that, if not exceeded, reduce the need to directly measure Se concentrations in fish tissue. Three factors that should currently be considered in developing waterborne Se screening guidelines are 1) differences between lotic and lentic sites, 2) the influence of exposure concentration on Se partitioning among compartments, and 3) the influence of sulfate on selenate bioavailability. Colocated data sets of Se concentrations in 1) water and particulates, 2) particulates and invertebrates, and 3) invertebrates and fish tissue were compiled; and a quantile regression approach was used to derive waterborne Se screening guidelines. Use of a regression-based approach for describing relationships in Se concentrations between compartments reduces uncertainty associated with selection of partitioning factors that are generally not constant over ranges of exposure concentrations. Waterborne Se screening guidelines of 6.5 and 3.0 mg/L for lotic and lentic water bodies were derived, and a sulfate-based waterborne Se guideline equation for selenate-dominated lotic waters was also developed.

AB The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accumulation of cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos when the fish Jenynsia multidentata was exposed to these pesticides singly and in technical and commercial mixtures. Adult female fish were exposed over 96 h to 0.04 mu g/L of cypermethrin; 0.4 mu g/L of chlorpyrifos; 0.04 mu g/L of cypermethrin + 0.4 mu g/L of chlorpyrifos in a technical mixture; and 0.04 mu g/L of cypermethrin + 0.4 mu g/L of chlorpyrifos in a mixture of commercial products. Fish exposed to cypermethrin accumulated this compound only in muscle, probably because of the low biotransformation capacity of this organ and the induction of cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) expression in the liver. The accumulation of chlorpyrifos occurred in fish exposed to the insecticide (intestine > liver > gills) even when these fish had higher gluthatione-S-transferase (GST) activity in gills and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression in the liver, compared with the control. Fish exposed to the technical mixture showed cypermethrin accumulation (liver > intestine > gills) with higher levels than those measured in fish after only cypermethrin exposure. Higher expression levels of CYP1A1 in the liver were also observed compared with the Control. Fish exposed to the commercial mixture accumulated both insecticides (cypermethrin: intestine > gills and chlorpyrifos: liver > intestine > gills > muscle). In the organs where accumulation occurred, biotransformation enzymes were inhibited. Consequently, the commercial formulation exposure provoked the highest accumulation of cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos in J. multidentata, possibly associated with the biotransformation system inhibition.

AB There is a risk of exposure of aquatic organisms to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from discharges of municipal and industrial wastewater. In the present study, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations (1 mg/L and 100 mg/L) of AgNPs and silver ions (Ag+) in static-renewal experiments conducted over 96 h and 10 d. The greatest accumulation of total Ag occurred in the liver of P. flavescens, and there was> 10-fold more accumulation in the treatments with Ag+ relative to the AgNP treatments. Residues of total Ag increased with concentration and duration of exposure in liver, gill, and muscle. Both exposures caused a 2-fold induction of gene expression for metallothionein (mt) in liver tissue after 96 h of exposure and reductions in levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in liver after 10 d of exposure. Both AgNPs and Ag+ decreased the expression of heat-shock proteins (hsp70). Exposure to the high concentration of AgNPs for 10 d significantly increased lipid peroxidation in gill tissue, as indicated by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay. There was a negative correlation between mean levels of GSSG and TBARS for both gill and liver tissue when data for all treatments were combined. It is significant that these biological responses were observed in P. flavescens exposed to AgNPs, even though accumulation of total Ag was at least 10-fold lower relative to the treatments with Ag+.

AB Although reports of pharmaceutical bioconcentration in aquatic organisms are increasing, less is known about trophic transfer in aquatic food webs. The bioaccumulation and trophodynamics of sertraline and fluoxetine, 2 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) frequently detected in aquatic environments, were tested by exposing constructed aquatic food chains to SSRIs under controlled laboratory conditions. Both of these ionizable, weak base pharmaceuticals showed lower bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) with increasing trophic level (i.e., no biomagnifications) in 2 3-level food chains (Acer platanoides, fed to Asellus aquaticus, in turn fed to Notonecta glauca or Pungitius pungitius). Mean sertraline BAFs in A. platanoides, A. aquaticus, N. glauca, and P. pungitus were 2200L/kg, 360L/kg, 26L/kg, and 49L/kg, respectively, and mean fluoxetine BAFs 1300L/kg, 110L/kg, 11L/kg, and 41L/kg, respectively. The weak influence of diet was further demonstrated by measured BAFs being equal to or lower than measured bioconcentration factors (BCFs). Organism lipid content was not positively correlated with BAFs, suggesting that other processes are driving interspecific differences in SSRI bioaccumulation. The empirically derived parameter values were introduced into a proposed bioaccumulation model, and a poor correlation was found between modeled and empirical BAFs (predicted r(2)=-0.63). In conclusion, the apparent lack of biomagnification of these ionizable pharmaceuticals suggests that environmental concern should not necessarily focus only on higher trophic levels, but also on species showing high BCFs at any trophic level.

AB Parameterizing speciation models by setting the percentage of dissolved organic matter (DOM) that is reactive (% r-DOM) toward metal cations at a single 65% default value is very common in predictive ecotoxicology. The authors tested this practice by comparing the free copper activity (pCu(2+) = -log(10)[Cu2+]) measured in 55 soil sample solutions with pCu(2+) predicted with the Windermere humic aqueous model (WHAM) parameterized by default. Predictions of Cu toxicity to soil organisms based on measured or predicted pCu(2+) were also compared. Default WHAM parameterization substantially skewed the prediction of measured pCu(2+) by up to 2.7 pCu(2+) units (root mean square residual = 0.75-1.3) and subsequently the prediction of Cu toxicity for microbial functions, invertebrates, and plants by up to 36%, 45%, and 59% (root mean square residuals <= 9%, 11%, and 17%), respectively. Reparametrizing WHAM by optimizing the 2 DOM binding properties (i.e., % r-DOM and the Cu complexation constant) within a physically realistic value range much improved the prediction of measured pCu(2+) (root mean square residual =0.14-0.25). Accordingly, this WHAM parameterization successfully predicted Cu toxicity for microbial functions, invertebrates, and plants (root mean square residual <= 3.4%, 4.4%, and 5.8%, respectively). Thus, it is essential to account for the real heterogeneity in DOM binding properties for relatively accurate prediction of Cu speciation in soil solution and Cu toxic effects on soil organisms.

AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have emerged as contaminants of global concern. Among several PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are persistent and bioaccumulative compounds. We investigated the cyto-genotoxic potential of PFOS to Allium cepa root meristem cells. The A. cepa root tips were exposed to 6 different concentrations (1-100 mg L-1) of PFOS for 48 h. Reduction in mitotic index and chromosomal aberrations was measured as genotoxic endpoints in meristematic root cells. Exposure to PFOS significantly affected cell division by reducing the miotic index at higher concentrations (>10 mg L-1). The median effect concentration of PFOS to elicit cytotoxicity based on the mitotic index was 43.2 mg L-1. Exposure to PFOS significantly increased chromosomal aberrations at concentrations >25 mg L-1. The common aberrations were micronuclei, vagrant cells, and multipolar anaphase. The alkaline comet assay revealed a genotoxic potential of PFOS with increased tail DNA percentage at concentrations >25 mg L-1. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the cyto-genotoxic potential of PFOS in higher plants. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-7. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB The tropical estuarine guppyPoecilia viviparawas used to address fish early life stage toxicity caused by the antifouling contaminant tributyltin (TBT). Six-day-oldP. viviparawere exposed for 7 d to control water and waterborne TBT at 15.8, 83.8, 716, and 818 ng tin (Sn) L-1. After exposure, swimming, feeding, growth, and eye histological endpoints were evaluated. Histopathological analysis of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) indicated alterations in pigment positioning at all TBT concentrations. A dose-dependent increase in photoreceptor layer disorganization and iris melanin hyperpigmentation was verified, and high frequencies of RPE invaginations and iris epithelial cell atrophy were observed even at the lowest exposure concentration of 15.8 ng Sn L-1. At the highest exposure level (818 ng Sn L-1) fish also presented reductions in swimming speed, swimming resistance, daily capture ofArtemianauplii, and growth in weight of 85, 60, 33, and 56% relative to controls, respectively. This association between retinal histopathology and reduced swimming and foraging behavior can reduce recruitment to the adult population.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-11. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB In the present study, we investigated whether the immortalized chicken hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, leghorn male hepatoma (LMH), had a comparable aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) response to primary chicken embryonic hepatocytes (CEHs) when used in a well-established assay for chemical screening and prioritization. The LMH cells were grown as 2-dimensional (2D) confluent cells and 3D spheroids to determine the optimal cell culture states for chemical screening. Cytochrome P450 1A4 and 1A5 (CYP1A) activity and gene expression were compared between CEHs and LMH cells grown in 2 culture states following exposure to the dioxin-like compound 3,3 ',4,4 ',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-126). The CYP1A activity was measured using the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay, and changes in mRNA expression associated with the AhR pathway were determined using a custom-designed polymerase chain reaction array. Among LMH cell culture states (i.e., 2D vs 3D), EROD induction was observed only in 3D LMH spheroids. Similarly, 3D spheroids had the greatest number of changes in AhR-related genes compared with confluent cells. Overall, these results suggest that LMH cells grown as 3D spheroids have a metabolic and gene expression profile that is comparable to that of CEH, and may represent a suitable animal-free alternative for in vitro screening of chemicals.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-9.

AB The soil adsorption coefficient (K-OC) plays an important role in environmental risk assessment of pesticide registration. Based on this risk assessment, applied and registered pesticides can be allowed in the European Union. Almost 1 yr is required to study and obtain theK(OC)value of a pesticide. Furthermore, acquiring theK(OC)requires a large cost. It is necessary to efficiently estimate theK(OC)value in the early stages of pesticide development. In the present study, the experimental values of physicochemical properties and molecular descriptors of chemical structures were collected to develop a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model, and the prediction performance of the model was evaluated. More specifically, we compared the accuracies of models based on a gradient boosting decision tree, multiple linear regression, and support vector machine. The experimental results suggest that it is possible to develop a QSPR model with high accuracy using both the molecular descriptors calculated from the structural formula and experimental values of physicochemical properties from open literature and databases. Comparing to the previously established models, we achieved high prediction accuracy, fitness, and robustness by only using freeware. Therefore, our developed QSPR models can be useful preliminary risk assessment in the early developmental stages of pesticides.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-9. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB In a laboratory experiment we investigated the effects of pesticide mixtures on the structure and function of freshwater biofilms, with focus on their photoautotrophic component. We identified 6 herbicides and 1 fungicide commonly found in Swedish streams at relatively high concentrations and created 3 ternary mixtures that were tested in concentration series ranging from observed environmental concentrations to up to 100 times higher. Biofilms were exposed to these pesticide mixtures for 8 d and then allowed to recover for another 12 d. Our results show a rapid and consistent inhibition of photosynthesis after just 24-h exposure to the highest test concentration of pesticides, as well as in some treatments with lower concentrations (i.e., 10 times the environmental level), on exposure. Interestingly, the observed effects were reversible because biofilm photosynthesis recovered rapidly and completely in clean media in all but one treatment. In contrast to the functional response, no effects were observed on the algal assemblage structure, as assessed by diagnostic pigments. We conclude that the pesticide mixtures induce a rapid but reversible inhibition of photosynthesis, without short-term effects on biofilm structure. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-8.

AB The management of pesticides to protect water quality remains a significant global challenge. Historically, despite regulatory frameworks intended to prevent, minimize, and manage off-site movement of pesticides, multiple generations of pesticide active ingredients have created a seemingly unending cycle of pesticide water pollution in both agricultural and urban watersheds. In California, the most populous and most agricultural US state, pesticide and water quality regulators realized in the 1990s that working independently of each other was not an effective approach to address pesticide water pollution. Over the years, these California agencies have developed a joint vision and have continued to develop a unified approach that has the potential to minimize pesticide risks to aquatic life through a combination of prevention, monitoring, and management actions, while maintaining pesticide availability for effective pest control. Key elements of the current California pesticide/water quality effort include: 1) pesticide and toxicity monitoring, coupled with watershed modeling, to maximize information obtained from monitoring; 2) predictive fate and exposure modeling to identify potential risks to aquatic life for new pesticide products when used as allowed by the label or to identify effective mitigation measures; and 3) management approaches tailored to the different pesticide uses, discharge sources, physical environments, and regulatory environments that exist for agricultural runoff, urban runoff, and municipal wastewater. Lessons from this effort may inform pesticide management elsewhere in the world as well as other chemical regulatory programs, such as the recently reformed US Toxic Substances Control Act and California's Safer Consumer Products regulatory program.

AB The objective of the present study was to conduct metal element analysis and carcinogenicity risk assessment of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mu m (PM2.5) from Shenzhen and Taiyuan. Samples of PM2.5 were collected in Shenzhen and Taiyuan during the yeas 2017 and 2018. Ten heavy metal elements were detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Health risk was assessed using the recommended US Environmental Protection Agency model. Metal elements found in PM2.5 samples from Shenzhen included (in decreasing order of concentration) Al, Pb, Mn, Cr, Cu, V, As, Ni, Cd, and Co. Metal elements found in Taiyuan included (in decreasing order of concentration) Al, Mn, Pb, Cr, Cu, As, Ni, V, Cd, and Co. There were significant differences in Pb, Mn, Al, As, and Ni levels between Shenzhen and Taiyuan (p < 0.05); but the remaining element levels did not show significant differences between the 2 cities. Risk-assessment data showed higher total risk from 5 carcinogenic metal elements in Taiyuan (3.79 x 10(-4)) compared to Shenzhen (2.44 x 10(-4)): Cr had the highest carcinogenicity risk (>10(-4)), followed by As, Ni, and Cd (10(-6) ~ 10(-4)), and Pb had the lowest risk (<10(-6)). The results indicated that some of the metal elements in PM2.5 samples from Shenzhen and Taiyuan pose a carcinogenicity risk; further research and measures for prevention and control should be considered.

AB Water quality standards for cobalt (Co) have not been developed for the European Union or United States. The objective of the present study was to produce freshwater Co toxicity data that could be used by both the European Union and the United States to develop appropriate regulatory standards (i.e., environmental quality standards or predicted-no-effect concentrations in Europe and ambient water quality criteria or state water quality standards in the United States). Eleven species, including algae, an aquatic plant, and several invertebrate and fish species, were used in the performance of acute and chronic Co toxicity tests. Acute median lethal or median effective concentration (LC50 or EC50) values ranged from 90.1 mu g Co/L for duckweed (Lemna minor) to 157 000 mu g Co/L for midges (Chironomus tentans). Chronic 10% effect concentration (EC10) values ranged from 4.9 mu g Co/L for duckweed to 2170 mu g Co/L for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Chronic 20% effect concentration (EC20) values ranged from 11.1 mu g Co/L for water flea (Ceriodaphnia dubia) to 2495 mu g Co/L for O. mykiss. Results indicated that invertebrate and algae/plant species are more sensitive to chronic Co exposures than fish. Acute-to-chronic ratios (derived as acute LC50s divided by chronic EC20s) were lowest for juvenile O. mykiss (0.6) and highest for the snail Lymnaea stagnalis (2670). Following the European-based approach and using EC10 values, species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) were developed and a median hazardous concentration for 5% of the organisms of 1.80 mu g Co/L was derived. Chronic EC20 values were used, also in an SSD approach, to derive a US Environmental Protection Agency-style final chronic value of 7.13 mu g Co/L. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;39:799-811.

AB Blooms of the cyanobacterium Microcystis spp. could affect fish health through the ingestion of colonies as well as exposure to dissolved microcystins in the water column. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the dietary exposure pathway through which Microcystis spp. blooms may affect liver function and nutritional status using a novel approach involving multiple analytical methods to assess the potential risk. Our study was conducted using threadfin shad, Dorosoma petenense, which is a pelagic fish commonly exposed to Microcystis spp. blooms in the upper San Francisco Estuary. The approach incorporated published and optimized methods that offer multiple lines of evidence including in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, histopathology, condition factor indices, and nutritional profiles. Measurements of threadfin shad health and tissue condition were conducted at sites where Microcystis was present or absent during the 2007 bloom season. The results showed that dietary exposure to fish from Microcystis blooms resulted in the accumulation of microcystin in the gut and liver tissues of threadfin shad collected from the sites with blooms. Although toxicity endpoints were likely confounded by antecedent conditions, our findings demonstrate dietary exposure of Microcystis toxins to fish using a novel approach with multiple lines of evidence.

AB Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen of natural and anthropogenic origin, is ubiquitously present in the environment. Effluents of nuclear centers of production are significant anthropogenic sources. With the upcoming project of thermonuclear fusion, tritium releases in the environment may increase. It is therefore important to characterize the ecological risk linked to tritium. The effects of tritiated water (HTO) were therefore studied in zebrafish larvae exposed for 10 d to different dose rates, 1.1 x 10(2), 4.1 x 10(2), and 3.8 x 10(3) mu Gy/h for larvae corresponding, respectively, to a water contamination of 10(4), 10(5), and 10(6) Bq/mL of HTO. Those dose rates were higher than 10 mu Gy/h, which is the threshold recommended to start monitoring ecosystems where radiological contaminants are present. Mortality, embryo-larval development, immune toxicity, genotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and alterations of tissues were investigated. The results showed that HTO exposure induced DNA damage and reactive oxygen species production and modulated the expression of genes involved in detoxification processes. Moreover, modifications of the muscular tissues (degradation of myofibrils at 4 d post fertilization and disorganization of mitochondria at later stages) were observed. The results differed with HTO dose rates and with developmental stages. These results will drive future research for the development of new HTO-sensitive biomarkers and will allow us to progress in the characterization of the modes of action of tritium in fish.

AB The toxicokinetics of triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) in vivo including the uptake, deposition, and biotransformation into the metabolite diphenyl phosphate (DPHP) is presently reported in embryonated eggs and chicks of Japanese quail. Quail were dosed with TPHP at 3 concentrations by air cell egg injection on embryonic day 0, followed by daily oral dosing after chicks hatched (5 d). Vehicle-only exposed controls were also used. In dosed eggs, only 33% of the TPHP remained 2 d after injection (no hepatic development); after 10 d (post-hepatogenesis), only 2% remained. The estimated TPHP half-lives in the eggs ranged from 1.1 to 1.8 d for the 3 dosed groups. In all exposed eggs and chicks, DPHP significantly increased with dose (0.001 < p < 0.044). It appears that DPHP is an important metabolite in quail, making up 41 to 74% of all metabolites formed in embryonated eggs. In chicks, at medium and high doses, DPHP concentrations significantly exceeded those of TPHP (p <= 0.007), making up 67 and 76% of the total burden, respectively. Our findings suggest that rapid TPHP metabolism occurred in chicks and embryonated quail eggs but that this may vary with the age of the embryonated egg and the stage of embryo development, which should be considered when evaluating concentrations of TPHP and DPHP measured in eggs of wild birds.

AB In the present study, the effects of short-term methoxychlor exposure on the viability, reproduction, and locomotor behavior of adult seminole ramshorn snails (Planorbella duryi) was assessed. To examine impacts on viability and behavior, individuals were exposed to a water control, vehicle control, or 12.5, 50, 100, 250, 500, or 1000 mu g/L of methoxychlor for 48 h; and differences in mortality and locomotor behavior assessed using the freely available ToxTrac software. To determine impacts on reproduction, pairs of snails were exposed to a vehicle control and 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 250 mu g/L of methoxychlor for 9 d; and the number of clutches and eggs laid quantified every 24 h. Methoxychlor concentrations in treatments were determined using gas chromatography. Complete mortality was observed in the 500 mu g/L and 1000 mu g/L treatments after 48 h and in the 250 mu g/L treatment after 9 d. Decreases in the number of egg clutches were observed in all treatments, and the number of eggs laid decreased starting in the 25 mu g/L treatment. Decreases in average speed, mobile speed, and total distance traveled, as well as a significant increase in frozen events, were also observed. Our results suggest that methoxychlor exposure causes detrimental effects on several nonlethal endpoints in a nonmodel aquatic invertebrate species and that the analysis of locomotor behaviors serves as a reliable, sensitive endpoint for ecotoxicology testing.

AB Mitochondria are key targets of many environmental contaminants, because specific chemicals can interact directly with mitochondrial proteins, lipids, and ribonucleic acids. These direct interactions serve as molecular initiating events that impede adenosine triphosphate production and other critical functions that mitochondria serve within the cell (e.g., calcium and metal homeostasis, apoptosis, immune signaling, redox balance). A limited but growing number of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) have been proposed to associate mitochondrial dysfunction with effects at organismal and population levels. These pathways involve key events such as altered membrane potential, mitochondrial fission/fusion, and mitochondrial DNA damage, among others. The present critical review and analysis reveals current progress on AOPs involving mitochondrial dysfunction, and, using a network-based computational approach, identifies the localization of mitochondrial molecular initiating events and key events within multiple existing AOPs. We also present 2 case studies, the first examining the interaction between mitochondria and immunotoxicity, and the second examining the role of early mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of behavior (i.e., locomotor activity). We discuss limitations in our current understanding of mitochondrial AOPs and highlight opportunities for clarifying their details. Advancing our knowledge of key event relationships within the AOP framework will require high-throughput datasets that permit the development and testing of chemical-agnostic AOPs, as well as high-resolution research that will enhance the mechanistic testing and validation of these key event relationships. Given the wide range of chemicals that affect mitochondria, and the centrality of energy production and signaling to ecologically important outcomes such as pathogen defense, homeostasis, growth, and reproduction, a better understanding of mitochondrial AOPs is expected to play a significant, if not central, role in environmental toxicology.

AB The release of in situ heavy metals (cadmium [Cd], copper [Cu], lead [Pb], manganese [Mn], and zinc [Zn]) from contaminated river sediment near a Cu-iron mine in South China was experimentally studied. The effects of pH values and the kinetics of heavy metal release were investigated. In addition, species of the 5 metals in the sediment were determined as a function of pH and time. Rates and extents of metal desorption were studied over 30 d, and a 3-parameter, 2-compartment model was used to analyze the desorption kinetics. The rate constants (k(s)) for the slowly desorbing fraction of heavy metals were found to be 5 to 6 orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding rate constants (k(r)) for the rapidly desorbing fraction, suggesting that slow desorption is the rate-limiting step. The partition coefficients (K-d) varied significantly among metals, on the order Pb > Cu >Zn > Cd > Mn, indicating that the sediment had a much higher retention capability for strongly hydrolyzed metals than for weakly hydrolyzed ones. The amount of metals released from the sediment decreased dramatically at the final pH of 2 to 4 and leveled off in the pH range of 5 to 8. Release time and pH exhibited a varied influence on the fractionation of metals, and had a more remarkable influence on more mobile fractions and hardly any effect on the residual fraction during the desorption process. The fractionation of strongly adsorbing metals like Pb was not as dependent on release time and pH as it was for the weakly bonded metals like Mn and Cd. The results indicate that in situ heavy metals may exhibit a sustainable potential for release and may increase health risks when the pH of the river is lowered. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:464-473.

AB In areas with heavy pesticide use, it is easy to attribute population declines to environmental contamination. The Blanchard's cricket frogs (Acris blanchardi) is an amphibian experiencing declines and range contractions across its distribution in the Midwest Corn Belt (USA). Experimental studies suggest that cricket frogs are sensitive to pesticides, but there are few studies examining this species' susceptibility to contaminants in realistic environments or comparing relative impacts with other anuran species. I reared 3 summer breeding anurans in outdoor mesocosms posthatching through metamorphosis to examine the effects of 2 insecticides (imidacloprid and carbaryl) and 1 herbicide (glyphosate with polyoxyethylene tallow amine) on larval development and metamorphosis. Cricket frogs were positively affected by insecticide exposure, likely a result of changes in the food web that increased food abundance. However, metamorphosis of green frogs (Lithobates clamitans) and gray tree frogs (Hyla chrysoscelis) appeared unaffected by pesticide exposure. The results of the present study suggest that the impacts of pesticides alone are unlikely to have population-level impacts for the anurans examined. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2699-2704.

AB Freshwater organisms are increasingly exposed to combinations of stressors. However, because it is time-consuming and costly, research on the interaction of stressors, such as compound toxicity and global warming on vertebrates, is scarce. Studies on multigenerational effects of these combined stressors are almost nonexistent. In the present study, we tested the combined effects of 4 degrees C warming and cadmium (Cd) exposure on life-history traits, biomarkers, bioaccumulation, and multigenerational tolerance in the turquoise killifish, Nothobranchius furzeri. The extremely short life cycle of this vertebrate model allows for assessment of sublethal and multigenerational effects within 4 mo. The applied Cd concentrations had only limited effects on the measured endpoints, which suggests that N. furzeri is more resistant to Cd than fathead minnow and rainbow trout. In contrast, the temperature increase of 4 degrees C was stressful: it delayed female maturation and lowered adult mass and fecundity. Finally, indications of synergistic effects were found on peak fecundity and embryonic survival. Overall, these results indicate the importance of studying chronic and multigenerational effects of combined stressors. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2361-2371. (c) 2018 SETAC.

AB Performance reference compounds (PRCs) are often added to passive samplers prior to field deployments to provide information about mass transfer kinetics between the sampled environment and the passive sampler. Their popularity has resulted in different methods of varying complexity to estimate mass transfer and better estimate freely dissolved concentrations (C-free) of targeted compounds. Three methods for describing a mass transfer model are commonly used: a first-order kinetic method, a nonlinear least squares fitting of sampling rate, and a diffusion method. Low-density polyethylene strips loaded with PRCs and of 4 different thicknesses were used as passive samplers to create an array of PRC results to assess the comparability and reproducibility of each of the methods. Samplers were deployed in the water column at 3 stations in New Bedford Harbor (MA, USA). Collected data allowed C-free comparisons to be performed in 2 ways: 1) comparison of C-free derived from one thickness using different methods, and 2) comparison of C-free derived by the same method using different thicknesses of polyethylene. Overall, the nonlinear least squares and diffusion methods demonstrated the most precise results for all the PCBs measured and generated C-free values that were often statistically indistinguishable. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) for total PCB measurements using the same thickness and varying model types ranged from 0.04 to 12% and increased with sampler thickness, and RSDs for estimates using the same method and varying thickness ranged from 8 to 18%. Environmental scientists and managers are encouraged to use these methods when estimating C-free from passive sampling and PRC data. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2089-2097.

AB We compared biochemical, functional, and behavioral responses to the organophosphorus anticholinesterase chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO) in mice (Mus musculus, CD-1) and toads (Anaxyrus cognatus, Great Plains toad). Toads were substantially less sensitive to acute lethality of CPO based on the maximum tolerated (nonlethal) dose (toads, 77mg/kg; mice, 5.9mg/kg). Sublethal exposures led to classical signs of toxicity (increased involuntary movements, autonomic secretions) in mice but hypoactivity in toads. Motor performance in an inclined plane test was not affected by CPO in mice but was altered at the highest dosage in toads. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase, monoacylglycerol lipase, and fatty acid amide hydrolase activities in brain were inhibited in mice but not in toads, and fatty acid amide hydrolase activity in the liver was inhibited in both species. Toad brain AChE was less sensitive to in vitro inhibition by CPO (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50; 20min, 37 degrees C], 101 vs 7.8nM; IC50 [20min, 26 degrees C], 149 vs 6.2nM), and studies of inhibitor kinetics indicated substantially lower anticholinesterase potency of CPO against the toad brain enzyme. Using an in vitro indirect inhibition assay, preincubation of CPO with toad brain homogenate was more effective than an equivalent mouse brain homogenate at reducing CPO potency. These data suggest that the relatively low sensitivity of toads to cholinergic toxicity is based on the low sensitivity of brain AChE, which in turn may be attributable to more effective target-site detoxification.

AB Ciguatera fish poisoning is a seafood-toxin illness resulting from consumption of fish contaminated with ciguatoxins. Managing ciguatera fish poisoning is complex. It is made easier, however, by local fishers from endemic areas reporting regional predictability for local fish species' ciguatera fish poisoning risk, which the present study then tested. We investigated the prevalence of ciguatoxins in 4 commonly marketed and consumed species (Balistes vetula, Haemulon plumierii, Ocyurus chrysurus, and Epinephelus guttatus) across an oceanic gradient (north, south, east, and west) from the US Virgin Islands. Fish muscle extracts were analyzed for Caribbean ciguatoxins using an in vitro mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cytotoxicity assay and confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Fish collected from the north location had 0 fish with detectable ciguatoxins; this site also had the greatest wave energy. Caribbean ciguatoxins in fish ranged from 0.01 to 0.11, 0.004 to 0.10, and 0.005 to 0.18ng Caribbean ciguatoxin-1 eq/g, from the west, east, and south respectively. Ciguatoxin-like activity was detectable by the N2a assay in 40, 41, 50, and 70% of H. plumierii, O. chrysurus, B. vetula, and E. guttatus, respectively. Of the fish collected, 4% had Caribbean ciguatoxin levels exceeding the US Food and Drug Administration guidance of 0.1ng Caribbean ciguatoxin-1 eq/g fish. These findings concurred with spatial ciguatera fish poisoning prevalence information provided by local fishers in the US Virgin Islands and demonstrate how partnerships between researchers and fishers can aid the improvement of science-based ciguatera fish poisoning management.

AB Based on the results of a Horizon Scanning exercise sponsored by the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry that focused on advancing the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework, the development of guidance related to AOP network development was identified as a critical need. This not only included questions focusing directly on AOP networks, but also on related topics such as mixture toxicity assessment and the implementation of feedback loops within the AOP framework. A set of two articles has been developed to begin exploring these concepts. In the present article (part I), we consider the derivation of AOP networks in the context of how it differs from the development of individual AOPs. We then propose the use of filters and layers to tailor AOP networks to suit the needs of a given research question or application. We briefly introduce a number of analytical approaches that may be used to characterize the structure of AOP networks. These analytical concepts are further described in a dedicated, complementary article (part II). Finally, we present a number of case studies that illustrate concepts underlying the development, analysis, and application of AOP networks. The concepts described in the present article and in its companion article (which focuses on AOP network analytics) are intended to serve as a starting point for further development of the AOP network concept, and also to catalyze AOP network development and application by the different stakeholder communities.

AB Progestins are utilized as a component of human contraceptives, and commonly enter the environment via wastewater treatment plant effluent. Certain progestins activate fish androgen receptors and cause decreases in fecundity and masculinization of females. We used a nest acquisition assay and computer-assisted sperm analysis to examine the effects of levonorgestrel on male fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) reproductive fitness. Males were exposed to 0, 10, or 100 ng/L levonorgestrel for 14 d. Combinations of a control male and a male from one of the treatments were placed into a competitive nesting assay, and the time each male spent holding the nest and time spent exhibiting aggressive behaviors were analyzed at 48 h postexposure. Semen samples were analyzed for total motility, straight-line velocity, curvilinear velocity, average path velocity, linearity, beat cross frequency, and wobble at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 s postactivation. Males exposed to either 10 or 100 ng/L of levonorgestrel exhibited increased nest acquisition success and lower levels of aggression compared with control-control pairings, as well as decreases in multiple sperm motion characteristics. Our results suggest that further research is required to ascertain the effects of levonorgestrel on male gamete quality and reproductive behaviors. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB The Pearl River (China) and its tributaries receive discharges of treated/untreated domestic sewage and industrial wastewater throughout the entire drainage basin. The river provides source water for many local inhabitants, and there is great concern over its pollution status. Fifteen sediment samples were collected from source water areas in the Pearl River Delta, and analyzed for the occurrence and distribution of 2 classes of emerging pollutants, organophosphorus flame retardants (OPs) and synthetic musks. In most sediments, 5 polycyclic musks and 2 nitro musks were detected, and galaxolide (1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta (g)-2-benzopyran [HHCB]) and tonalide (7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene [AHTN]) were the predominant components, with concentrations of 0.030 to 547 and 4.31 to 439 ng/g, respectively. Seven widely used OPs were found in most sediments, at varying total concentrations from 1.79 to 143 ng/g, with tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEOP), tris(2-chloro-isopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP), and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) being the main components. The results indicated that industrial discharge and domestic sewage played important roles for synthetic musk and OP distribution in sediments in the study area. In general, higher levels of OPs and synthetic musks were found in Guangzhou, Foshan, and Dongguan, suggesting a significant impact from industrial discharges and the dense population of these regions.

AB Various statistical tests on concentration data serve to support decision-making regarding characterization and monitoring of contaminated media, assessing exposure to a chemical, and quantifying the associated risks. However, the routine statistical protocols cannot be directly applied because of challenges arising from nondetects or left-censored observations, which are concentration measurements below the detection limit of measuring instruments. Despite the existence of techniques based on survival analysis that can adjust for nondetects, these are seldom taken into account properly. A comprehensive review of the literature showed that managing policies regarding analysis of censored data do not always agree and that guidance from regulatory agencies may be outdated. Therefore, researchers and practitioners commonly resort to the most convenient way of tackling the censored data problem by substituting nondetects with arbitrary constants prior to data analysis, although this is generally regarded as a bias-prone approach. Hoping to improve the interpretation of concentration data, the present article aims to familiarize researchers in different disciplines with the significance of left-censored observations and provides theoretical and computational recommendations (under both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks) for adequate analysis of censored data. In particular, the present article synthesizes key findings from previous research with respect to 3 noteworthy aspects of inferential statistics: estimation of descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.

AB Serotonin plays a crucial role in mussel survival and reproduction. Although the serotonin system can be affected by metals, the effects of environmental concentrations of metals such as manganese (Mn), lead (Pd), and cadmium (Cd) have never been studied in blue mussels. The present study aimed to determine the effects of exposure to Mn, Pb, or Cd on serotonin levels, monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, and serotonin transporter (SERT) levels in the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. Mussels were exposed in vivo to increasing and environmentally relevant doses of Mn (10-1000 nM; 0.5-50 mu g/L), Pb (0.01-10 nM; 0.002-2 mu g/L), or Cd (0.01-10 nM; 0.001-1 mu g/L) for 28 d. Serotonin levels, MAO activity, and SERT expression were analyzed in the mussel mantle. Expression of SERT protein was significantly decreased, by up to 81%, following Mn, Pb, or Cd exposure. The activity of MAO in females was almost 2-fold higher, versus males, in nonexposed control mussels. In mussels exposed to 0.1nM of Pb (0.02 mu g/L), MAO activity was increased in males and decreased in females. In Cd-exposed mussels, a sex-dependent, inverted nonmonotonic pattern of MAO activity was observed. These results clearly indicate that low environmental concentrations of Mn, Pb, and Cd affect the serotonin system in blue mussels. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of growing concern in aquatic environments worldwide; nevertheless, knowledge of its effects on aquatic biota is restricted to a few model species with limited information regarding its mechanisms of impact. In the present study, diclofenac accumulation, its effects on metabolic rate, ionoregulation, and oxidative stress were examined at environmentally relevant (0.17 mu gL(-1)) and elevated (763 mu gL(-1)) concentrations in a culturally and economically important galaxiid fish, inanga (Galaxias maculatus), from the Southern Hemisphere. This species is among the most widespread freshwater fish in the world but its sensitivity to emerging contaminants is unknown. Following an acute 96-h exposure, bioconcentration of diclofenac was measured in the inanga whole-body, resulting in an estimated bioconcentration factor of 87 for the 0.17-mu gL(-1) exposure concentration, approaching values where transfer through the food chain should be considered. Lipid peroxidation in the liver was significantly elevated at both 0.17- and 763-mu gL(-1) exposure concentrations but lipid peroxidation in the kidney and gill decreased after diclofenac exposure. Catalase activity was also elevated in the liver of inanga but activity decreased in the gill. There were no effects of diclofenac on metabolic rate or ion (sodium and calcium) influx rates. These data indicate that toxicologically relevant adverse outcomes and bioconcentration of diclofenac at environmentally relevant levels warrant additional study in this important fish.

AB Little is known about the effect of metal mixtures on marine organisms, especially after exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations. This information is, however, required to evaluate the need to include mixtures in future environmental risk assessment procedures. We assessed the effect of copper (Cu)-Nickel (Ni) binary mixtures on Mytilus edulis larval development using a full factorial design that included environmentally relevant metal concentrations and ratios. The reproducibility of the results was assessed by repeating this experiment 5 times. The observed mixture effects were compared with the effects predicted with the concentration addition model. Deviations from the concentration addition model were estimated using a Markov chain Monte-Carlo algorithm. This enabled the accurate estimation of the deviations and their uncertainty. The results demonstrated reproducibly that the type of interactionsynergism or antagonismmainly depended on the Ni concentration. Antagonism was observed at high Ni concentrations, whereas synergism occurred at Ni concentrations as low as 4.9g Ni/L. This low (and realistic) Ni concentration was 1% of the median effective concentration (EC50) of Ni or 57% of the Ni predicted-no-effect concentration (PNEC) in the European Union environmental risk assessment. It is concluded that results from mixture studies should not be extrapolated to concentrations or ratios other than those investigated and that significant mixture interactions can occur at environmentally realistic concentrations. This should be accounted for in (marine) environmental risk assessment of metals. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3471-3479. (c) 2017 SETAC.

AB The synthetic progestin levonorgestrel is commonly utilized in human oral contraceptives. It enters the environment as a component of wastewater treatment plant effluent, and has been measured at low ng/L concentrations in surface waters. It has been shown to activate fish androgen receptors, causing the physical masculinization of females, changes in reproductive behavior, and decreases in fecundity. In the present study, the effects of levonorgestrel exposure on early-stage oogenesis in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) was examined. Adult females were exposed to 0, 10, or 100ng/L levonorgestrel for 14 d using a flow-through exposure system. The ovaries from each female were then removed via dissection and weighed for gonadosomatic index (GSI) calculations, and oocytes from one lobe preserved in Serra's fixative. Total numbers of late-stage vitellogenic oocytes exhibiting a germinal vesicle were then quantified. In a second exposure, blood plasma samples were collected from adult females and analyzed for vitellogenin concentrations using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Females exposed to both concentrations of levonorgestrel developed male secondary sexual characteristics in a dose-dependent manner, and ovaries contained significantly fewer late stage oocytes. Exposure to 100ng/L of levonorgestrel resulted in decreased GSI and blood plasma vitellogenin concentrations. The results suggest that female exposure to levonorgestrel alone may have profound effects on reproduction in progestin-contaminated environments. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3299-3304.

AB Testicular oocytes (TOs) have been found in black bass (Micropterus spp.) from many locations in North America. The presence of TOs is often assumed to imply exposure to estrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs); however, a definitive causal relationship has yet to be established, and TO prevalence is not consistently low in fish from areas lacking evident EDC sources. This might indicate any of a number of situations: 1) unknown or unidentified EDCs or EDC sources, 2) induction of TOs by other stressors, or 3) testicular oocytes occurring spontaneously during normal development. In the present study, we analyzed TO occurrence in smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) from 8 populations in northeastern Minnesota watersheds with differing degrees of human development and, hence, presumed likelihood of exposure to anthropogenic chemicals. Three watersheds were categorized as moderately developed, based on the presence of municipal wastewater discharges and higher human population density (4-81perkm(2)), and 5 watersheds were minimally developed, with very low human population density (0-1perkm(2)) and minimal built environment. Testicular tissues from mature fish were evaluated using a semiquantitative method that estimated TO density, normalized by cross-sectional area. Testicular oocyte prevalence and density among populations from moderately developed watersheds was higher than in populations from minimally developed watersheds. However, TO prevalence was unexpectedly high and variable (7-43%) in some populations from minimally developed watersheds, and only weak evidence was found for a relationship between TO density and watershed development, suggesting alternative or more complex explanations for TO presence in smallmouth bass from this region.

AB In a recent scientific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority it is argued that the accumulation of plant protection products in sediments over long time periods may be an environmentally significant process. Therefore, the European Food Safety Authority proposed a calculation to account for plant protection product accumulation. This calculation, however, considers plant protection product degradation within sediment as the only dissipation route, and does not account for sediment dynamics or back-diffusion into the water column. The hydraulic model Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System (HEC-RAS; US Army Corps of Engineers) was parameterized to assess sediment transport and deposition dynamics within the FOrum for Co-ordination of pesticide fate models and their USe (FOCUS) scenarios in simulations spanning 20 yr. The results show that only 10 to 50% of incoming sediment would be deposited. The remaining portion of sediment particles is transported across the downstream boundary. For a generic plant protection product substance this resulted in deposition of only 20 to 50% of incoming plant protection product substance. In a separate analysis, the FOCUS TOXSWA model was utilized to examine the relative importance of degradation versus back-diffusion as loss processes from the sediment compartment for a diverse range of generic plant protection products. In simulations spanning 20 yr, it was shown that back-diffusion was generally the dominant dissipation process. The results of the present study show that sediment dynamics and back-diffusion should be considered when calculating long-term plant protection product accumulation in sediment. Neglecting these may lead to a systematic overestimation of accumulation. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3223-3231. (c) 2017 SETAC

AB The scientific consensus model USEtox((R)) is recommended by the European Commission as the reference model to characterize life cycle chemical emissions in terms of their potential human toxicity and freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity impacts in the context of the International Reference Life Cycle Data System Handbook and the Environmental Footprint pilot phase looking at products (PEF) and organizations (OEF). Consequently, this model has been systematically used within the PEF/OEF pilot phase by 25 European Union industry sectors, which manufacture a wide variety of consumer products. This testing phase has raised some questions regarding the derivation of and the data used for the chemical-specific freshwater ecotoxicity effect factor in USEtox. For calculating the potential freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity impacts, USEtox bases the effect factor on the chronic hazard concentration (HC50) value for a chemical calculated as the arithmetic mean of all logarithmized geometric means of species-specific chronic median lethal (or effect) concentrations (L[E]C50). We investigated the dependency of the USEtox effect factor on the selection of ecotoxicological data source and toxicological endpoints, and we found that both influence the ecotoxicity ranking of chemicals and may hence influence the conclusions of a PEF/OEF study. We furthermore compared the average measure (HC50) with other types of ecotoxicity effect indicators, such as the lowest species EC50 or no-observable-effect concentration, frequently used in regulatory risk assessment, and demonstrated how they may also influence the ecotoxicity ranking of chemicals. We acknowledge that these indicators represent different aspects of a chemical's ecotoxicity potential and discuss their pros and cons for a comparative chemical assessment as performed in life cycle assessment and in particular within the PEF/OEF context.

AB Previous assessments of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) toxicity were hampered by lack of high-resolution analytical analysis, use of nonstandard toxicity methods, and variability between OSPW samples. We integrated ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry with a toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) approach to quantitatively identify the primary cause of acute toxicity of OSPW to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The initial characterization of OSPW toxicity indicated that toxicity was associated with nonpolar organic compounds, and toxicant(s) were further isolated within a range of discrete methanol fractions that were then subjected to Orbitrap mass spectrometry to evaluate the contribution of naphthenic acid fraction compounds to toxicity. The results showed that toxicity was attributable to classical naphthenic acids, with the potency of individual compounds increasing as a function of carbon number. Notably, the mass of classical naphthenic acids present in OSPW was dominated by carbon numbers 16; however, toxicity was largely a function of classical naphthenic acids with 17 carbons. Additional experiments found that acute toxicity of the organic fraction was similar when tested at conductivities of 400 and 1800mhos/cm and that rainbow trout fry were more sensitive to the organic fraction than larval fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Collectively, the results will aid in developing treatment goals and targets for removal of OSPW toxicity in water return scenarios both during operations and on mine closure.

AB In 2011, poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were analyzed in surface water and fish fillet samples taken from Pool 2 of the Upper Mississippi River, a 33-mile stretch inclusive of the Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota (USA) metropolitan area. Approximately 100 each of bluegill, freshwater drum, smallmouth bass, and white bass were sampled within the study area. Surface water samples were also collected from each of the 10 sampling reaches established for the study. Water and fillet samples were analyzed for perfluorinated carboxylic acids (C4-C12), perfluorinated sulfonic acids (C4, C6, and C8), and perfluorooctane sulfonamide. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was observed with the greatest frequency in fish fillets and ranged from 3.0 to 760ng/g wet weight. Mean (geometric) PFOS concentrations in bluegill, freshwater drum, smallmouth bass, and white bass were 20, 28, 29, and 58ng/g wet weight, respectively. When compared with fish data collected in 2009, a significant reduction (p<0.05) in PFOS concentrations was noted. This finding was confirmed based on data from studies conducted in 2012 and 2013. Overall, between 2009 and 2013, PFOS concentrations decreased by 65, 76, and 50% for bluegill, freshwater drum, and white bass, respectively (44% decrease for smallmouth bass from 2009 to 2012). These declines in fish PFOS concentrations are consistent with ongoing efforts to effectively control sources of PFASs to the Mississippi River. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3138-3147. (c) 2017 SETAC

AB Substituted phenylamine antioxidants (SPAs) are high production volume chemicals that are incorporated into a variety of commercial products (e.g., polymers, dyes, lubricants). There are few data on chronic toxicity of SPAs to fish and no data on the toxicity of SPAs to the early life stages of fish. The physicochemical properties of SPAs would suggest that if they were to enter an aquatic ecosystem they would partition into sediment. Therefore, the present study focused on investigating the chronic effect of sediment-associated SPAs to the early life stages of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Eggs and larvae were exposed to sediment spiked with diphenylamine (DPA), N-phenyl-1-napthylamine (PNA), N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine (DPPDA), or 4,40-methylene-bis[N-sec-butylaniline] (MBA). The most sensitive endpoint for DPA, PNA, and DPPDA was total survival with 21-d median lethal concentrations (LC50s) based on concentration in overlying water of 1920, 74, and 35 mu g/L, respectively. The most sensitive endpoint for MBA was growth with a 21-d median effective concentration (EC50) of 71 mu g/L. The same endpoints were the most sensitive in terms of concentrations of DPA, PNA, DPPDA, and MBA in sediment (101, 54, 111, and 76 mu g/g dry wt, respectively). Species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) were constructed for each SPA based on acute and chronic toxicity data generated in the present study and found in the literature. Overall, P. promelas was in the midrange of chronic sensitivity, with the most sensitive species being Tubifex tubifex. The SSDs indicate that DPA based on concentration in water is the least toxic to aquatic biota of the 4 SPAs investigated. The constructed SSDs indicate that a concentration in water and sediment of 1 mu g/L and 1 mu g/g dry weight, respectively, would be protective of > 95% of the aquatic species tested. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Because it is impossible to chemically analyze all relevant micropollutants, the implementation of bioanalytical tools is essential to estimate ecological risks of chemical mixtures in regular water-monitoring programs. The first tier of the Smart Integrated Monitoring (SIMONI) strategy, which was described in part I, is based on the combination of passive sampling and bioanalytical measurements. Bioassay responses are compared with effect-based trigger values (EBT), and an overall SIMONI score on all bioassay data was designed to indicate environmental risks. The present study is focused on analyzing the feasibility of the hazard identification tier by evaluating results of 45 field campaigns at sites with different pollution profiles near the city of Amsterdam. A Daphnia assay was performed in situ, while silicon rubber or polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) extracts were tested with 4 nonspecific (daphnids, algae, bacteria, and cell culture) and 10 specific (9 Chemical Activated Luciferase Gene Expression [CALUX] assays and antibiotics scan) bioassays. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the relevance of 2 classification variables in the SIMONI score formula on all bioanalytical data. The model indicated increased risks for the ecosystem at surface waters in greenhouse areas and undiluted wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. The choice of testing specific bioassays on either polar or nonpolar passive sampling extracts is cost-effective and still provided meaningful insights on micropollutant risks. Statistical analyses revealed that the model provides a relevant overall impact assessment based on bioassay responses. Data analyses on the chemically determined mixture toxic pressure and bioanalytical methods provided similar insights in relative risk ranking of water bodies. The SIMONI combination of passive sampling and bioanalytical testing appears to be a feasible strategy to identify chemical hazards. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Two of the main classes of pesticides commonly used in agriculture are azole fungicides and pyrethroid insecticides. Because azoles have been shown to synergize the effect of pyrethroids, the effect of their mixture is of concern. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of sublethal concentrations of epoxiconazole and a-cypermethrin and their mixture on growth, reproduction, and in vivo cytochrome P450 activity of the aquatic crustacean Daphnia magna over 42 d. Continuous exposure to nonlethal concentrations of alpha-cypermethrin at 20 ng/L negatively affected adult growth and number and size of neonates within the first 14 d of exposure. Exposure to epoxiconazole at 25 mu g/L increased protein content of adults within 1 to 3 d after initiating exposure and increased cumulative number of offspring at exposure times > 31 d. Epoxiconazole enhanced the negative effect of alpha-cypermethrin up to 3-fold leading to decreased growth, cytochrome P450 activity, and reproduction of D. magna within the first 14 d of exposure. After 14 d, the synergistic interactions disappeared. The reported effects, although lacking direct negative consequence in the long term, might have cumulative toxicity with other stressors such as food scarcity, predation, and pathogens, posing an additional hazard for the organisms at the beginning of their life cycle.

AB The PETROTOX model was developed to perform aquatic hazard assessment of petroleum substances based on substance composition. The model relies on the hydrocarbon block method, which is widely used for conducting petroleum substance risk assessments providing further justification for evaluating model performance. Previous work described this model and provided a preliminary calibration and validation using acute toxicity data for limited petroleum substance. The objective of the present study was to re-evaluate PETROTOX using expanded data covering both acute and chronic toxicity endpoints on invertebrates, algae, and fish for a wider range of petroleum substances. The results indicated that recalibration of 2 model parameters was required, namely, the algal critical target lipid body burden and the log octanol-water partition coefficient (K-OW) limit, used to account for reduced bioavailability of hydrophobic constituents. Acute predictions from the updated model were compared with observed toxicity data and found to generally be within a factor of 3 for algae and invertebrates but overestimated fish toxicity. Chronic predictions were generally within a factor of 5 of empirical data. Furthermore, PETROTOX predicted acute and chronic hazard classifications that were consistent or conservative in 93 and 84% of comparisons, respectively. The PETROTOX model is considered suitable for the purpose of characterizing petroleum substance hazard in substance classification and risk assessments. (C) 2017 SETAC.

AB Intersex in wild fish populations has received considerable attention in the scientific literature and public media. Conventional detection of testicular oocytes, the presence of immature oocytes within testis of male fish, commonly employs transverse sectioning of excised testis and is lethal. The present study used a nonlethal laparoscopic technique to collect biopsies of testis from black bass, entering the body cavity via the genital pore. Detection of testicular oocytes was compared between biopsy and conventional methods using 79 smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) from 8 sites and 68 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) from 4 sites. The 2 methods performed similarly at sites where testicular oocyte severity was moderate or high (6 of 8 smallmouth bass sites), whereas transverse sectioning resulted in superior testicular oocyte detection at sites where severity was low (2 of 8 smallmouth bass sites and all 4 largemouth bass sites). In smallmouth bass, testicular oocyte prevalence by transverse and biopsy methods was strongly correlated across sites (r(2) = 0.81) and severity reported by enumeration of testicular oocytes was moderately correlated across sites (r(2) = 0.59). Survival of a subset of largemouth bass (n = 20) to 28 d after laparoscopic surgery was 90%. The present research indicates that laparoscopy may be useful for monitoring the prevalence and severity of testicular oocytes in Micropterus species, particularly when lethal sampling is precluded.

AB Using immune cells of sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis in early development as a model, the cellular protective mechanisms against ionic and poly(allylamine)-coated silver nanoparticle (AgNPs; 14 +/- 6 nm) treatments at 100 mu g L-1 were investigated. Oxidative stress, heat shock protein expression, and pigment production by spherulocytes were determined as well as AgNP translocation pathways and their multiple effects on circulating coelomocytes. Sea urchins showed an increasing resilience to Ag over time because ionic Ag is accumulated in a steady way, although nanoAg levels dropped between 48 h and 96 h. A clotting reaction emerged on tissues injured by dissolved Ag (present as chloro-complexes in seawater) between 12 h and 48 h. Silver contamination and nutritional state influenced the production of reactive oxygen species. After passing through coelomic sinuses and gut, AgNPs were found in coelomocytes. Inside blood vessels, apoptosis-like processes appeared in coelomocytes highly contaminated by poly(allylamine)-coated AgNPs. Increasing levels of Ag accumulated by urchins once exposed to AgNPs pointed to a Trojan-horse mechanism operating over 12-d exposure. However, under short-term treatments, physical interactions of poly(allylamine)-coated AgNPs with cell structures might be, at some point, predominant and responsible for the highest levels of stress-related proteins detected. The present study is the first report detailing nano-translocation in a marine organism and multiple mechanisms by which sea urchin cells can deal with toxic AgNPs. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The aim of the present study was to characterize the immune response-total hemocyte number, cell type proportion, hemocyte viability, lysosomal membrane stability, phagocytic activity, cellular acid and alkaline phosphatase activity, and humoral bacteriolytic and phenoloxidase activity-in Diplodon chilensis exposed to 0.2 mg/L of azinphos-methyl (AZM), using Escherichia coli as immunological and pro-oxidant challenges. In addition, glutathione-S-transferase and lipid peroxidation thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were analyzed in gill tissue. Mussels from an unpolluted site were treated for 3 d as follows: 1) experimental control; 2) solvent effects control (acetone 0.01%); 3) bacterial challenge effects control (E. coli, 5 cells/mL x 10(4) cells/mL); 4) pesticide effects control (AZM in acetone); 5) control for combined effects of solvent and bacterial challenge; and 6) exposed to AZM, then challenged with E. coli. The results showed increased granulocyte proportion and phagocytic activity. Partial reversion of deleterious effects of E. coli on lysosomal membranes was observed in mussels exposed to AZM and then challenged with E. coli. Total hemocyte number and humoral bacteriolytic activity were increased only by E. coli challenge. Acid phosphatase activity was increased by both E. coli and AZM, whereas the stimulating effect of E. coli on alkaline phosphatase activity was negatively modulated by AZM. Azinphos-methyl inhibited phenoloxidase activity regardless of the E. coli challenge. Gill glutathione-S-transferase activity was increased by E. coli treatment either alone or pretreated with acetone or AZM and by AZM alone. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels were reduced by AZM alone or combined with the E. coli challenge and by acetone followed by the E. coli challenge. Both acetone and AZM seem to be important modulators of immune and antioxidant responses in D. chilensis. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The use of manure as an agricultural amendment is increasing the release of steroid hormones into the environment. Most research in this field has focused on estrogenic phenomena, with less attention paid to androgenic substances. The present study assessed androgenic activity in broiler manure using in vitro approaches based on cells stably transfected with androgen receptor. Leaching experiments were also performed to observe whether endocrine disruptors present in manure pass through a soil column and potentially reach groundwater. In parallel, an analytical chemistry method was used to determine the contribution of the most important natural androgens to androgenicity. Samplings were performed at 4 farms in 2 seasons. All but 2 samples showed androgen activity. In leakage experiments, however, no androgenic activity was detectable in leachates or in soils after leaching. According to the analytical results, androgenicity can be attributed mainly (but not completely) to androstenedione, and dihydrotestosterone. Similarly to the bioassays, chemical analysis did not reveal the presence of any androgen in leachates or soils. These results point to a rapid degradation of the substances responsible for androgenic activity in soils under the experimental conditions of the present study. However, the long-term effects associated with the constant and intensive application of manure to agricultural land require further attention. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The present study examined potential effects of seasonal variations in photoreactive dissolved organic matter (DOM) on methylmercury (MeHg) photodemethylation rates in freshwaters. A series of controlled experiments was carried out using natural and photochemically preconditioned DOM in water collected from 1 lake in June, August, and October. Natural DOM concentrations doubled between June and August (10.2-21.2 mg CL-1) and then remained stable into October (19.4 mg C L-1). Correspondingly, MeHg concentrations peaked in August (0.42 ng L-1), along with absorbances at 350 nm and 254 nm. Up to 70% of MeHg was photodemethylated in the short 48-h irradiation experiments, with June having significantly higher rates than the other sampling months (p < 0.001). Photodemethylation rate constants were not affected by photoreactive DOM, nor were they affected by initial MeHg concentrations (p > 0.10). However, MeHg photodemethylation efficiencies (quantified in moles MeHg lost/moles photon absorbed) were higher in treatments with less photoreactive DOM. Congruently, MeHg photodemethylation efficiencies also decreased over summer by up to 10 times across treatments in association with increased photoreactive DOM, and were negatively correlated with DOM concentration. These results suggest that an important driver of MeHg photodemethylation is the interplay between MeHg and DOM, with greater potential for photodemethylation in freshwaters with more photobleached DOM and lower DOM content.

ID MODEL
AB The use of plant protection products on agricultural crops can result in exposure of birds and mammals to toxic chemicals. In the European Union, the risks from such exposures are assessed under the current (2009) guidance document from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), designed to increase the realism of the theoretical risk assessments in comparison to its predecessor (SANCO/4145/2000). Since its adoption over 7 yr ago, many plant protection products have been evaluated successfully using the 2009 EFSA guidance document. However, there are still significant areas of improvement recommended for future revisions of this guidance. The present Focus article discusses experiences to date with the current scheme, including levels of conservatism in input parameters and interpretation by regulatory authorities together with proposals for how the guidance document could be improved when it is revised in the not too distant future. Several areas for which further guidance is recommended have been identified, such as the derivation of ecologically relevant bird and mammal reproductive endpoints and the use of modeling approaches to contextualize risk assessments. Areas where existing databases could be improved were also highlighted, including the collation of relevant focal species across Europe and expansion of the residue database for food items. To produce a realistic and useable guidance document in the future, it is strongly recommended that there is open and constructive communication between industry, regulatory authorities, and the EFSA. Such collaboration would also encourage harmonization between member states, thus reducing workloads for both industry and regulatory authorities. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB In the first part of a broader study on the effects of individual and multicomponent mixtures of pharmaceutical active compounds, the authors used the Microtox((R)) test system to analyze in detail the effects of 10 widely used human and veterinary pharmaceutical active compounds toward the bioluminescent bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri. The experimental results indicated moderate toxicity for the majority of the tested compounds. Comparison between experimental 50% inhibitory concentrations and those predicted from the quantitative structure-activity relationship models indicated that most of the tested pharmaceutical active compounds behave as polar narcotic compounds toward A. fischeri (only the antibiotic chlortetracycline seemed to have a specific mechanism of action). A comparison between the experimental results and a collection of acute toxicity data on other nontarget organisms indicated that in general A. fischeri has a comparable sensitivity to other aquatic species. However, according to the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, the majority of the investigated chemicals can be classified as harmful or nontoxic for aquatic ecosystems. Finally, based on comparisons among the 95th percentile of measured environmental concentrations found in European Union water bodies and acute toxicity data on various aquatic organisms, no risk to aquatic life exists when the tested pharmaceutical active compounds are assessed as individual chemicals.

AB A weight of evidence approach in environmental assessment includes the use of biomonitor organisms to measure biologically available contaminant concentrations and lethal and sublethal responses in an exposure, dose, and response framework. Corbicula australis was assessed as a test species for metal toxicity using in situ river sediment exposures at 4 locations in the Molonglo River (New South Wales, Australia), which has a legacy of sediment metal contamination, following 8 decades of mining in its upper reaches. A sediment metal contamination gradient was evident from 12.5 km to 47 km downstream of the mine, as follows: zinc (851-130 mg/kg) > lead (104-7 mg/kg) > copper (31-5 mu g/kg) > cadmium (2-0.3 mg/kg). Exposed C. australis accumulated the following metals in tissue: zinc (1358-236 mu g/g) > copper (24-20 mu g/g) > cadmium (4.7-0.7mg/g) = lead (4.2-1.8 mu g/g). Biomarker responses showed increased sublethal impairment with increased tissue metal concentrations. Total antioxidant capacity was mildly impaired, with corresponding increased lipid peroxidation and lysosomal membrane destabilization at the higher tissue metal concentrations. Corbicula australis proved to be an effective biomonitor organism for sediment metal assessment, as it is able to accumulate metals relative to sediment concentrations and showed a pattern of increased sublethal impairment with increased tissue metal concentration. It is recommended as a suitable species for incorporation into local freshwater monitoring and assessment programs. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Fungicides are used widely in agriculture and have been detected in adjacent rivers and wetlands. However, relatively little is known about the potential effects of fungicides on aquatic organisms. The present study investigated the effects of 2 commonly used fungicides, the boscalid fungicide Filan (R) and the myclobutanil fungicide Systhane (TM) 400 WP, on life history traits (survival, growth, and reproduction) and energy reserves (lipid, protein, and glycogen content) of the amphipod Austrochiltonia subtenuis under laboratory conditions, at concentrations detected in aquatic environments. Amphipods were exposed to 3 concentrations of Filan (1 mu g active ingredient [a.i.]/L, 10 mu g a.i./L, and 40 mu g a.i./L) and Systhane (0.3 mu g a.i./L, 3 mu g a.i./L, and 30 mu g a.i./L) over 56 d. Both fungicides had similar effects on the amphipod at the organism level. Reproduction was the most sensitive endpoint, with offspring produced in controls but none produced in any of the fungicide treatments, and total numbers of gravid females in all fungicide treatments were reduced by up to 95%. Female amphipods were more sensitive than males in terms of growth. Systhane had significant effects on survival at all concentrations, whereas significant effects of Filan on survival were observed only at 10 mu g a. i./L and 40 mu g a.i./L. The effects of fungicides on energy reserves of the female amphipod were different. Filan significantly reduced amphipod protein content, whereas Systhane significantly reduced the lipid content. The present study demonstrates wide-ranging effects of 2 common fungicides on an ecologically important species that has a key role in trophic transfer and nutrient recycling in aquatic environments. These results emphasize the importance of considering the long-term effects of fungicides in the risk assessment of aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Triclocarban (TCC) is an antimicrobial agent routinely detected in surface waters that has been hypothesized to interact with the vertebrate endocrine system. The present study examined the effects of TCC alone and in combination with the model endocrine disruptor 17-trenbolone (TRB) on fish reproductive function. Adult Pimephales promelas were continuously exposed to either 1 mu g TCC/L or 5 mu g TCC/L, to 0.5 mu g TRB/L, or to a mixture (MIX) of 5 mu g TCC/L and 0.5 mu g TRB/L for 22 d, and a variety of reproductive and endocrine-related endpoints were examined. Cumulative fecundity was significantly reduced in fathead minnows exposed to TRB, MIX, or 5 mu g TCC/L. Exposure to 1 mu g TCC/L had no effect on reproduction. In general, both TRB and MIX treatments caused similar physiological effects, evoking significant reductions in female plasma vitellogenin, estradiol, and testosterone, and significant increases in male plasma estradiol. Based on analysis of the ovarian transcriptome, there were potential pathway impacts that were common to both TRB- and TCC-containing treatment groups. In most cases, however, those pathways were more plausibly linked to differences in reproductive status than to androgen-specific functions. Overall, TCC was reproductively toxic to fish at concentrations at or near those that have been measured in surface water. There was little evidence that TCC elicits reproductive toxicity through a specific mode of endocrine or reproductive action, nor that it could augment the androgenic effects of TRB. Nonetheless, the relatively small margin of safety between some measured environmental concentrations and effect concentrations suggests that concern is warranted.

AB Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) cause significant health and reproductive problems in many vertebrates. Exposure during embryogenesis likely leads to defects in organ development, compromising survival and growth through adulthood. The present study identifies the impact of PCBs on the embryonic development of key organs and resulting consequences on survival and growth. Zebrafish embryos were treated with individual PCB congeners (126 or 104) or one of 4 Aroclor mixtures (1016, 1242, 1254, or 1260) and analyzed for changes in gross embryonic morphology. Specific organs were assessed for defects during embryonic development, using a variety of transgenic zebrafish to improve organ visualization. Resulting larvae were grown to adulthood while survival and growth were assayed. Embryonic gross development on PCB treatment was abnormal, with defects presenting in a concentration-dependent manner in the liver, pancreas, heart, and blood vessel organization. Polychlorinated biphenyl 126 treatment resulted in the most consistently severe and fatal phenotypes, whereas treatments with PCB 104 and Aroclors resulted in a range of more subtle organ defects. Survival of fish was highly variable although the growth rates of surviving fish were relatively normal, suggesting that maturing PCB-treated fish that survive develop compensatory strategies needed to reach adulthood. Life span analyses of fish from embryogenesis through adulthood, as in the present study, are scarce but important for the field because they help identify foci for further studies.

AB There has been an increased emphasis on incorporating bioavailability-based approaches into freshwater guideline value derivations for metals in the Australian and New Zealand water quality guidelines. Four bioavailability models were compared: the existing European biotic ligand model (European Union BLM) and a softwater BLM, together with 2 newly developed multiple linear regressions (MLRs)-a trophic level-specific MLR and a pooled MLR. Each of the 4 models was used to normalize a nickel ecotoxicity dataset (combined tropical and temperate data) to an index condition of pH 7.5, 6 mg Ca/L, 4 mg Mg/L, (i.e., approximately 30 mg CaCO3/L hardness), and 0.5 mg DOC/L. The trophic level-specific MLR outperformed the other 3 models, with 79% of the predicted 10% effect concentration (EC10) values within a factor of 2 of the observed EC10 values. All 4 models gave similar normalized species sensitivity distributions and similar estimates of protective concentrations (PCs). Based on the index condition water chemistry proposed as the basis of the national guideline value, a protective concentration for 95% of species (PC95) of 3 mu g Ni/L was derived. This guideline value can be adjusted up and down to account for site-specific water chemistries. Predictions of PC95 values for 20 different typical water chemistries for Australia and New Zealand varied by >40-fold, which confirmed that correction for nickel bioavailability is critical for the derivation of site-specific guideline values.

AB The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is reviewing the protectiveness of the national ambient water quality criteria (WQC) for nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) and compiling toxicity databases to update the WQC. An amphipod (Hyalella azteca) and a unionid mussel (Lampsilis siliquoidea) have shown high sensitivity to Ni and Zn in previous studies. However, there remained uncertainties regarding the influence of test duration (48 vs 96 h) and the presence and absence of food in acute exposures with the amphipod, and there were also concerns about poor control of amphipod growth and reproduction and mussel growth in chronic exposures. We conducted acute 48- and 96-h water-only toxicity tests to evaluate the influence of feeding and test durations on the toxicity of dissolved Ni and Zn to the amphipod; we also used recently refined test methods to conduct chronic Ni and Zn toxicity tests to evaluate the sensitivity of the amphipod (6-wk exposure) and the mussel (4- and 12-wk exposures). The 96-h 50% effect concentrations (EC50s) of 916 mu g Ni/L and 99 mu g Zn/L from acute amphipod tests without feeding decreased from the 48-h EC50s by 62 and 33%, respectively, whereas the 96-h EC50s of 2732 mu g Ni/L and 194 mu g Zn/L from the tests with feeding decreased from the 48-h EC50s by 10 and 26%, indicating that the presence or absence of food had apparent implications for the 96-h EC50. Our chronic 6-wk EC20s for the amphipod (4.5 mu g Ni/L and 35 mu g Zn/L) were 50 to 67% lower than the 6-wk EC20s from previous amphipod tests, and our chronic 4-wk EC20s for the mussel (41 mu g Ni/L and 66 mu g Zn/L) were similar to or up to 42% lower than the 4-wk EC20s from previous mussel tests. The lower EC20s from the present study likely reflect more accurate estimates of inherent sensitivity to Ni and Zn due to the refined test conditions. Finally, increasing the chronic test duration from 4 to 12 wk substantially increased the toxicity of Zn to the mussel, whereas the 4- and 12-wk Ni effect needs to be re-evaluated to understand the large degree of variation in organism responses observed in the present study.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-13.

AB Synthetic chemicals are frequently detected in water bodies, and their concentrations vary over time. Water monitoring programs typically employ either a sequence of grab samples or continuous sampling, followed by chemical analysis. Continuous time-proportional sampling yields the time-weighted average concentration, which is taken as proxy for the real, time-variable exposure. However, we do not know how much the toxicity of the average concentration differs from the toxicity of the corresponding fluctuating exposure profile. We used toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic models (invertebrates, fish) and population growth models (algae, duckweed) to calculate the margin of safety in moving time windows across measured aquatic concentration time series (7 pesticides) in 5 streams. A longer sampling period (14 d) for time-proportional sampling leads to more deviations from the real chemical stress than shorter sampling durations (3 d). The associated error is a factor of 4 or less in the margin of safety value toward underestimating and an error of factor 9 toward overestimating chemical stress in the most toxic time windows. Under- and overestimations occur with approximate equal frequency and are very small compared with the overall variation, which ranged from 0.027 to 2.4 x 10(10)(margin of safety values). We conclude that continuous, time-proportional sampling for a period of 3 and 14 d for acute and chronic assessment, respectively, yields sufficiently accurate average concentrations to assess ecotoxicological effects.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-11.

AB Statistical inferences play a critical role in ecotoxicology. Historically, null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) has been the dominant method for inference in ecotoxicology. As a brief and informal definition of NHST, researchers compare (or "test") an experimental treatment or observation against a hypothesis of no relationship (the "null hypothesis") using the collected data to see if the observed values are statistically "significant" given predefined error rates. The resulting probability of observing a value equal to or greater than the observed value assuming the null hypothesis is true is thepvalue. Criticisms of NHST have existed for almost a century and have recently grown to the point where statisticians, including the American Statistical Association (ASA), have felt the need to clarify the role of NHST andpvalues beyond their current common use. These limitations also exist in ecotoxicology. For example, a review of the 2010Environmental Toxicology & Chemistry(ET&C) volume that found many authors did not correctly reportpvalues. We repeated this review looking at the 2019 volume ofET&C. Incorrect reporting ofpvalues still occurred almost a decade later. Problems with NHST andpvalues highlight the need for statistical inferences besides NHST, something long known in ecotoxicology and the broader scientific and statistical communities. Furthermore, concerns such as these led the executive director of the ASA to recommend against use of "statistical significance" in 2019. In light of these criticisms, ecotoxicologists require alternative methods. We describe some alternative methods including confidence intervals, regression analysis, dose-response curves, Bayes factors, survival analysis, and model selection. Lastly, we provide insights for what ecotoxicology might look like in a post-pvalue world.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;39:1657-1669. Published 2020.

AB Feminization of male fish and the role of endocrine-active chemicals in this phenomenon has been an area of intense study for many years. Estrone (E1), a natural steroid, is found in aquatic environments sometimes at high concentrations relative to the estrogenic steroids 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol. However, E1 has been less thoroughly studied than E2 or 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol due in part to a relatively lower potency in metabolically limited estrogen receptor (ER) binding/activation assays. Recent evidence suggests that in vivo biotransformation of E1 to E2 may occur in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) residing in environments with high concentrations of E1, such as near wastewater treatment plants. The enzymes likely responsible for this biotransformation, 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17 beta HSDs), have been well characterized in mammals but to a lesser extent in fish species. In the present study, a novel systematic analysis of amino acid sequence data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database demonstrated that multiple 17 beta HSD isoforms are conserved across different fish species. Experimentally, we showed that metabolically active hepatic cytosolic preparations from 2 commercially important salmonid species, rainbow trout and lake trout, biotransformed E1 to E2 to a degree sufficient to alter results of competitive ER binding assays. These results from in silico and in vitro analyses indicate that E1 and biotransformation may play a significant role in adverse effects on development and reproduction of a variety of fish species in contaminated aquatic environments.

AB Organic micropollutants of anthropogenic origin in river waters may impair aquatic ecosystem health and drinking water quality. To evaluate micropollutant fate and turnover on a catchment scale, information on input source characteristics as well as spatial and temporal variability is required. The influence of tributaries from agricultural and urban areas and the input of wastewater were investigated by grab and Lagrangian sampling under base flow conditions within a 7.7-km-long stretch of the Ammer River (southwest Germany) using target screening for 83 organic micropollutants and 4 in vitro bioassays with environmentally relevant modes of action. In total, 9 pesticides and transformation products, 13 pharmaceuticals, and 6 industrial and household chemicals were detected. Further, aryl hydrocarbon receptor induction, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activity, estrogenicity, and oxidative stress response were measured in the river. The vast majority of the compounds and mixture effects were introduced by the effluent of a wastewater-treatment plant, which contributed 50% of the total flow rate of the river on the sampling day. The tributaries contributed little to the overall load of organic micropollutants and mixture effects because of their relatively low discharge but showed a different chemical and toxicological pattern from the Ammer River, though a comparison to effect-based trigger values pointed toward unacceptable surface water quality in the main stem and in some of the tributaries. Chemical analysis and in vitro bioassays covered different windows of analyte properties but reflected the same picture.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-10.

AB Estrogen toxicity has been an area of priority in aquatic toxicology over the last 20 yr. Currently, estrogen toxicity is primarily linked to classical estrogen signaling, the interaction of estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ER alpha and ER beta). Recent evidence has indicated that a rapid, nongenomic, nonclassical estrogen signaling pathway exists via the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), which is expressed in many biological systems, with roles in the cardiovascular system. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) on the heart rate of embryonic Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). A significant decrease (bradycardia) in embryonic heart rate was observed at all treatment concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/L EE2) at 144, 168, and 192 h postfertilization (hpf; p <= 0.05), whereas 120 and 216 hpf embryos experienced a significant decrease from the control at 10, 100, and 1000 ng/L EE2 and 0.1, 100, and 1000 ng/L EE2, respectively (p <= 0.05). In addition, using select estrogen receptor modulators, it was demonstrated that estrogen-induced bradycardia appears to be linked to GPER and not ER alpha and ER beta. The present study highlights GPER as a novel and alternative mode of action for EE2 toxicity at environmentally relevant concentrations. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-9. (c) 2020 SETAC

ID HYDROCARBON-CONTAMINATED SOILS; BIOREMEDIATION; BIODEGRADATION; NOCARDIA
AB Unlike most other conventional petroleum products that are derived from crude oil, gas-to-liquids (GTLs) are petroleum products that are synthesized from natural gas (methane). This process results in GTL products having no sulfur and low aromatic content, so they should have less impact on human health and the environment compared with crude oil-derived products. The GTLs have been registered for use as nonaqueous base fluids (NABFs) in drilling muds, which aid in the process of drilling wells for oil and gas extraction; it is through these uses and others that they enter terrestrial environments. The primary objective of the present study was to determine whether GTLs were less toxic to terrestrial soil biota than conventional NABFs used for land-based drilling, such as diesel and low-toxicity mineral oil (LTMO). A second objective was to understand the fate and impact of these fluids under more realistic soil and aging conditions of a common west Texas (USA) oil-producing region (i.e., sandy loam soil with low organic matter and a hot arid climate). Acute terrestrial toxicity studies were conducted on the soft-bodied terrestrial invertebrate earthworm (Eisenia fetida) along with 3 plant species-alfalfa (Medicago stavia), thickspike wheatgrass (Elymus lanceolatus), and fourwing saltbrush (Atriplex canescens). We also assessed changes in microbial community structure of the soils following additions of NABF. Overall, the GTL NABFs had lower toxicity compared with conventional NABFs like diesel and LTMO, as measured by invertebrate toxicity, plant seed germination, and impact on the microbial community.

AB The US Army is replacing traditional munitions with insensitive munitions resistant to accidental detonation. Although the parent insensitive munition compound nitroguanidine (NQ) is generally not acutely toxic at concentrations >1000 mg/L in aquatic exposures, products formed by intensive ultraviolet (UV) degradation resulted in multiple-order of magnitude increases in toxicity. A methylated congener of NQ, 1-methyl-3-nitroguanidine (MeNQ), is also being assessed for potential use in insensitive munition explosive formulations; therefore, the present study investigated the hazard of parent versus UV-degraded MeNQ using fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Although up to 716 mg/L parent MeNQ caused no significant mortality or effects on growth in larval P. promelas fish in 7-d exposures, a similar concentration of MeNQ subjected to UV treatment resulted in 85% mortality. The UV treatment degraded only 3.3% of the MeNQ (5800 mg/L stock, UV-treated for 6 h), indicating that MeNQ degradation products have potentially high toxicity. The parent MeNQ exposure caused significantly decreased transcriptional expression of genes within the significantly enriched insulin metabolic pathway, suggesting antagonism of bioenergetics pathways, which complements observed, although nonsignificant, decreases in body weight. Significant differential transcriptional expression in the UV-degraded MeNQ treatments resulted in significant enrichment of pathways and functions related to the cell cycle, as well as erythrocyte function involved in O-2/CO2 exchange. These functions represent potential mechanistic sources of increased toxicity observed in the UV-degraded MeNQ exposures, which are distinct from previously observed mechanisms underlying increased toxicity of UV-degraded NQ in fish.

AB Recently, monoalkyl oxo-hydroxo tin clusters have emerged as a new class of metal-oxide resist to support the semiconductor industry's transition to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Under EUV exposure, these tin-based clusters exhibit higher performance and wider process windows than conventional polymer materials. A promising new monoalkyl precursor, [(BuSn)(12)O-14(OH)(6)][OH](2) (BuSn), is still in its infancy in terms of film formation. However, understanding potential environmental effects could significantly affect future development as a commercial product. We synthesized and explored the toxicity of nano-BuSn in the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the crustacean Daphnia magna at exposure concentrations ranging from 0 to 250 mg/L. Nano-BuSn had no effect on C. reinhardtii growth rate irrespective of concentration, whereas high nanoparticle concentrations (>= 100 mg/L) increased D. magna immobilization and mortality significantly. To simulate an end-of-life disposal and leachate contamination, BuSn-coated film wafers were incubated in water at various pH values and temperatures for 14 and 90 d to investigate leaching rates and subsequent toxicity of the leachates. Although small quantities of tin (1.1-3.4% of deposited mass) leached from the wafers, it was insufficient to elicit a toxic response regardless of pH, incubation time, or temperature. The low toxicity of the tin-based thin films suggests that they can be an environmentally friendly addition to the material sets useful for semiconductor manufacturing.

AB Multigenerational studies have become of great interest in ecotoxicology since the consequence of parental exposure to contaminants on offspring generations was established in situ or in laboratory conditions. The present study mainly examined the chronic effects of external Cs-137 gamma irradiation exposure at 4 dose rates (control, 0.5, 5, and 50 mGy h(-1)) on adult zebrafish (F0) exposed for 10 d and their progeny (F1) exposed or unexposed for 4 to 5 d. The main endpoints investigated included parental reproductive performance, embryo-larval survival, DNA alterations, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in F0 and F1. No effects on reproductive success, fecundity, or egg fertilization rate were observed. However, drastic effects were observed on F1 exposed to 50 mGy h(-1), resulting in a mortality rate of 100%. The drastic effects were also observed when the progeny was not irradiated. It was demonstrated that the sensitivity of the embryos was mainly attributable to parental irradiation. Moreover, these drastic effects induced by adult irradiation disappeared over time when 10 d-irradiated adults were placed in a nonirradiated condition. Alterations in larval DNA were observed for the 3 dose rates, and an increase of ROS production was also shown for the 2 lowest dose rates. The present study improves our understanding of the consequences of parental exposure conditions to the progeny. Furthermore, it provides an incentive to take transmitted generational effects into account in ecological risk assessments. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-12. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB In the Northern Patagonian gulfs of Argentina (Golfo Nuevo and Golfo San Jose), blooms of toxigenic microalgae and the detection of their associated phycotoxins are recurrent phenomena. The present study evaluated the transfer of phycotoxins from toxigenic microalgae to mesozooplankton in Golfo Nuevo and Golfo San Jose throughout an annual cycle (December 2014-2015 and January 2015-2016, respectively). In addition, solid-phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) samplers were deployed for the first time in these gulfs, to estimate the occurrence of phycotoxins in the seawater between the phytoplankton samplings. Domoic acid was present throughout the annual cycle in SPATT samplers, whereas no paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins were detected. Ten toxigenic species were identified: Alexandrium catenella, Dinophysis acuminata, Dinophysis acuta, Dinophysis tripos, Dinophysis caudata, Prorocentrum lima, Pseudo-nitzschia australis, Pseudo-nitzschia calliantha, Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta, and Pseudo-nitzschia pungens. Lipophilic and hydrophilic toxins were detected in phytoplankton and mesozooplankton from both gulfs. Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were the toxigenic species most frequent in these gulfs. Consequently, domoic acid was the phycotoxin most abundantly detected and transferred to upper trophic levels. Spirolides were detected in phytoplankton and mesozooplankton for the first time in the study area. Likewise, dinophysistoxins were found in mesozooplankton from both gulfs, and this is the first report of the presence of these phycotoxins in zooplankton from the Argentine Sea. The dominance of calanoid copepods indicates that they were the primary vector of phycotoxins in the pelagic trophic web. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-15. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB The United Nations and the European Union have developed guidelines for the assessment of long-term (chronic) chemical environmental hazards. This approach recognizes that these hazards are often related to spillage of chemicals into freshwater environments. The goal of the present study was to examine the concept of metal ion removal from the water column in the context of hazard assessment and classification. We propose a weight-of-evidence approach that assesses several aspects of metals including the intrinsic properties of metals, the rate at which metals bind to particles in the water column and settle, the transformation of metals to nonavailable and nontoxic forms, and the potential for remobilization of metals from sediment. We developed a test method to quantify metal removal in aqueous systems: the extended transformation/dissolution protocol (T/DP-E). The method is based on that of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The key element of the protocol extension is the addition of substrate particles (as found in nature), allowing the removal processes to occur. The present study focused on extending this test to support the assessment of metal removal from aqueous systems, equivalent to the concept of "degradability" for organic chemicals. Although the technical aspects of our proposed method are different from the OECD method for organics, its use for hazard classification is equivalent. Models were developed providing mechanistic insight into processes occurring during the T/DP-E method. Some metals, such as copper, rapidly decreased (within 96 h) under the 70% threshold criterion, whereas others, such as strontium, did not. A variety of method variables were evaluated and optimized to allow for a reproducible, realistic hazard classification method that mimics reasonable worst-case scenarios. We propose that this method be standardized for OECD hazard classification via round robin (ring) testing to ascertain its intra- and interlaboratory variability.

AB The use of organic wastes as soil amendments can be an important measure to improve soil quality and reduce waste accumulation and landfilling. However, the potential contaminant loads of such wastes, can be a source of environmental concern. Consequently, legislation has been developed to regulate the use of these wastes in agricultural soils. However, the regulations only consider chemical parameters, which are insufficient to establish the level of environmental risk. A possible solution is the use of species sensitivity distributions (SSDs), employing ecotoxicological data from test batteries that could be incorporated into legislation. In the present study, 2 different hazardous concentrations affecting 5 and 50% of the soil community (HC5 and HC50, respectively) were determined using ecotoxicological data (effect concentrations, 10 and 50% [EC10 and EC50, respectively]) for 5 different wastes. The results demonstrate that, as expected, current legislative thresholds do not translate to environmental risk/protection and that SSDs may be an important tool allowing the simple inclusion and interpretation of ecotoxicological data from test batteries in legislation. On the other hand, SSDs must be used with caution because there are still doubts about their actual value in risk prediction and about which estimates provide adequate protection. For instance, the use of HC50(EC10) values is not recommended; these values overlap with the more conservative HC5(EC50) data, highlighting the fact that the use of lower effect concentrations may not always provide the most protective approach. Also, hazardous concentrations need to be calibrated at the field or semifield level, to verify environmental protection in different soils/environments and the adequacy of standard test organisms.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are emerging environmental contaminants that can be transformed by anaerobic microorganisms in anoxic environments. The present study examined 2 consortia, enriched under methanogenic and sulfate-rich conditions, that demethylate the phenylmethyl ether anti-inflammatory drug naproxen to 6-O-desmethylnaproxen. Both enriched consortia were also able to demethylate a range of phenylmethyl ether compounds of plant-based origin or used as PPCPs. Results from 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the 2 communities were very different despite sharing the same PPCP metabolism. In most cases, the demethylated metabolite was not further degraded but rather accumulated in the culture medium. For the expectorant guaifenesin, this resulted in a novel microbial metabolite. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first report of methylparaben metabolism under methanogenic conditions. The wide range of phenylmethyl ether substrates that underwent O-demethylation in both methanogenic and sulfate-rich conditions suggests that there are potentially bioactive transformation products in the environment that have not yet been quantified.

AB Phthalic acid esters (PAEs) represent an ongoing pollution problem and have attracted extensive attention due to their ubiquitous presence in the environment. We investigated the distribution of 6 PAEs (benzyl butyl phthalate [BBP], dibutyl phthalate [DBP], di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate [DEHP], diethyl phthalate [DEP], dimethyl phthalate [DMP], and di-n-octyl phthalate [DnOP]) in cultivated soils, including vegetable fields and paddy fields, as well as the soils of E-waste dismantling sites. We also explored the relationship between the particle size of soils and the distribution of PAEs, put forward a novel method to forecast the occurrence and fate of PAEs in soils with DEHP used as a chemical indicator, and made a preliminary assessment of the potential ecological risks of the 6 target compounds in soils. The results showed that the detection rate of target PAEs was 100%, and that the concentrations of n-ary sumation (6)PAEs ranged from 1.2 to 7.3 mg/kg in vegetable fields, 1.2 to 1.5 mg/kg in paddy fields, and 11.8 to 17.9 mg/kg in E-waste dismantling sites. In addition, DEHP exhibited the maximum concentrations (0.480-15.34 mg/kg) in all soil samples. The results also showed that in the wake of decreasing particle size, increasing soil organic carbon would enhance the sorption of PAEs in soils. Moreover, the correlation formula of DEHP successfully predicted the concentrations of other PAEs and n-ary sumation (6)PAEs in soils, suggesting that DEHP could be a dependable chemical indicator for forecasting the environmental occurrence of PAEs in soils. Based on the residual levels in the trial sites and limited toxicity data, high risks to soil organisms are expected for DBP, DEP, and DEHP, and low-medium risks for BBP, DnOP, and DMP.

AB Much progress has been made in the past few decades in understanding the sources, transport, fate, and biological effects of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in aquatic ecosystems. Despite these advancements, significant obstacles still prevent comprehensive assessments of the environmental risks associated with the presence of CECs. Many of these obstacles center around the extrapolation of effects of single chemicals observed in the laboratory or effects found in individual organisms or species in the field to impacts of multiple stressors on aquatic food webs. In the present review, we identify 5 challenges that must be addressed to promote studies of CECs from singular exposure events to multispecies aquatic food web interactions. There needs to be: 1) more detailed information on the complexity of mixtures of CECs in the aquatic environment, 2) a greater understanding of the sublethal effects of CECs on a wide range of aquatic organisms, 3) an ascertaining of the biological consequences of variable duration CEC exposures within and across generations in aquatic species, 4) a linkage of multiple stressors with CEC exposure in aquatic systems, and 5) a documenting of the trophic consequences of CEC exposure across aquatic food webs. We examine the current literature to show how these challenges can be addressed to fill knowledge gaps. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:46-60. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Urban stormwater is an important but incompletely characterized contributor to surface-water toxicity. The present study used 5 bioassays of 2 model organisms (Daphnia magna and fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas) to investigate stormwater toxicity and mitigation by full-scale iron-enhanced sand filters (IESFs). Stormwater samples were collected from major stormwater conveyances and full-scale IESFs during 4 seasonal events (winter snowmelt and spring, early summer, and late summer rainfalls) and analyzed for a diverse range of contaminants of emerging concern including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, industrial chemicals, and pesticides. Concurrently, stormwater samples were collected for toxicity testing. Seasonality appeared more influential and consistent than site type for most bioassays. Typically, biological consequences were least in early summer and greatest in late summer and winter. In contrast with the unimproved and occasionally reduced biological outcomes in IESF-treated and late summer samples, water chemistry indicated that numbers and total concentrations of detected organic chemicals, metals, and nutrients were reduced in late summer and in IESF-treated stormwater samples. Some potent toxicants showed more specific seasonality (e.g., high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and industrial compounds in winter, pesticides in early summer and spring, flame retardants in late summer), which may have influenced outcomes. Potential explanations for insignificant or unexpected stormwater treatment outcomes include confounding effects of complex stormwater matrices, IESF nutrient removal, and, less likely, unmonitored toxicants.

AB Parabens, bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan, and triclocarban are recognized endocrine-disrupting contaminants (EDCs); and their occurrence in the environment has attracted increasing concern. Body size-dependent bioaccumulation, tissue distribution, trophic magnification, and maternal transfer of methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butylparabens; 2-phenylphenol (PHP); BPA; triclosan; and triclocarban were investigated in freshwater fish of the Pearl River catchment, China. Most of the EDCs were detected in more than half of the biota samples, ranging from not detected to 6750ngg(-1) lipid weight, with median concentrations of 5 to 72ngg(-1) lipid weight. Livers generally contained the highest EDC levels (1609 +/- 1860ngg(-1) lipid wt, mean +/- standard deviation), followed in decreasing order by eggs (842 +/- 1317ngg(-1) lipid wt), belly fats (488 +/- 465ngg(-1) lipid wt), and dorsal muscles (240 +/- 239ngg(-1) lipid wt) of the wildlife. Body size-dependent bioaccumulation of the EDCs was observed in the freshwater fish, which varied according to species, tissue, and compound. The concentrations of triclosan, PHP, and BPA usually showed decreasing trends, whereas parabens mostly demonstrated increasing tendency with increasing fish weights, indicating effects of growth dilution and bioaccumulation, respectively. Potential biomagnification was shown by triclosan with trophic magnification factors of 3.0, 4.3, and 4.0 in liver, belly fat, and dorsal muscle, respectively. In addition, the potential of maternal transfer in the fish was primarily revealed for methyl- and propylparabens, PHP, triclosan, and BPA. Presence of the EDCs in the freshwater organisms of the Pearl River catchment warrants more attention considering the potential of trophic magnification and maternal transfer.

AB Dreissenid mussels Dreissena bugensis (quagga mussel) and Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) are prolific invasive species to the freshwaters of the United States and Western Europe. In the Great Lakes, D. polymorpha has initially dominated the system since its invasion in the mid-1980s; however, recently D. bugensis has displaced D. polymorpha as the dominant species. Dreissena bugensis has several competitive advantages over D. polymorpha, including greater tolerances to deeper and colder waters and lower respiration rates. Nevertheless, physiological differences between the species remain largely unknown. The oxidative stress response is a mechanism used by all organisms to mitigate environmental stress by reducing oxygen radicals in the body, and comparing this mechanism between similar species can be useful for understanding how different species compete in aquatic environments. We compared oxidative stress biomarkers (lipid peroxidation [LPO] and catalase [CAT] activity) in mussels after exposure to 4 stressors (i.e., high densities, temperature, hypoxia, and polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]) independently and in combinations of 2 stressors. Overall, D. bugensis had lower LPO and CAT activity than D. polymorpha when exposed to single stressors; however, in multiple stressor treatments D. bugensis had increased LPO, especially with high temperatures and PCBs. The lower lipid damage in D. bugensis compared with D. polymorpha under single stressor conditions may come at the cost of the ability to respond to multiple stressors.

AB Three common false-negative scenarios have been encountered with amendment addition in whole-sediment toxicity identification evaluations (TIEs): dilution of toxicity by amendment addition (i.e., not toxic enough), not enough amendment present to reduce toxicity (i.e., too toxic), and the amendment itself elicits a toxic response (i.e., secondary amendment effect). One such amendment in which all 3 types of false-negatives have been observed is with the nonpolar organic amendment (activated carbon or powdered coconut charcoal). The objective of the present study was to reduce the likelihood of encountering false-negatives with this amendment and to increase the value of the whole-sediment TIE bioassay. To do this, the present study evaluated the effects of various activated carbon additions to survival, growth, emergence, and mean development rate of Chironomus tepperi. Using this information, an alternative method for this amendment was developed which utilized a combination of multiple amendment addition ratios based on wet weight (1%, lower likelihood of the secondary amendment effect; 5%, higher reduction of contaminant) and nonconventional endpoints (emergence, mean development rate). This alternative method was then validated in the laboratory (using spiked sediments) and with contaminated field sediments. Using these multiple activated carbon ratios in combination with additional endpoints (namely, emergence) reduced the likelihood of all 3 types of false-negatives and provided a more sensitive evaluation of risk.

AB A hybrid model based on the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model and the health risk assessment model for assessing risks associated with sources of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in water was established and applied at Dianchi Lake to test its applicability. The new method contains 2 stages: 1) the sources of PFASs were apportioned by the PMF model and 2) the contribution of health risks from each source was calculated by the new hybrid model. Two factors were extracted by PMF, with factor 1 identified as aqueous fire-fighting foams source and factor 2 as fluoropolymer manufacturing and processing and perfluorooctanoic acid production source. The health risk of PFASs in the water assessed by the health risk assessment model was 9.54 x 10(-7) a(-1) on average, showing no obvious adverse effects to human health. The 2 sources' risks estimated by the new hybrid model ranged from 2.95 x 10(-10) to 6.60 x 10(-6) a(-1) and from 1.64 x 10(-7) to 1.62 x 10(-6) a(-1), respectively. The new hybrid model can provide useful information on the health risks of PFAS sources, which is helpful for pollution control and environmental management. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Mercury (Hg) compounds represent an important risk to aquatic ecosystems because of their persistence, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification potential. In the present review, we critically examine state-of-the-art studies on the interactions of Hg compounds with freshwater biofilms, with an emphasis on Hg accumulation, transformations, and effects. Freshwater biofilms contain both primary producers (e.g., algae) and decomposers (e.g., bacteria and fungi), which contribute to both aquatic food webs and the microbial loop. Hence they play a central role in shallow water and streams, and also contribute to Hg trophic transfer through their consumption. Both inorganic and methylated mercury compounds accumulate in biofilms, which could transform them mainly by methylation, demethylation, and reduction. Accumulated Hg compounds could induce diverse metabolic and physiological perturbations in the microorganisms embedded in the biofilm matrix and affect their community composition. The bioavailability of Hg compounds, their transformations, and their effects depend on their concentrations and speciation, ambient water characteristics, biofilm matrix composition, and microorganism-specific characteristics. The basic processes governing the interactions of Hg compounds with biofilm constituents are understudied. The development of novel conceptual and methodological approaches allowing an understanding of the chemo- and biodynamic aspects is necessary to improve the knowledge on Hg cycling in shallow water as well as to enable improved use of freshwater biofilms as potential indicators of water quality and to support better informed risk assessment.

AB A multilocational field trial was conducted at 4 locations in IndiaRajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and West Bengalto determine the persistence in cabbage of chlorfluazuron applied twice at 75 and 150g active ingredient ha(-1). Cabbage head samples were collected from each replicated plot on 0 (2h after spraying), 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15d after final insecticide application, including an untreated control. Chlorfluazuron residue in cabbage and field soil was estimated by high-performance liquid chromatography using a photo diode array detector. The limit of determination and limit of quantification of the method were recorded as 0.05 and 0.10gg(-1), respectively. Results revealed that chlorfluazuron dissipated linearly with progress of time, following first-order kinetics. The mean (+/- standard deviation) half-life value of chlorfluazuron in cabbage was found to be 7.18 +/- 0.71 d, considering different locations and treatments. The residue was below the level of quantification in the harvested cabbage and soil samples. Harvesting cabbage in the experimental location, at least on day 7, after 2 applications of chlorfluazuron at the recommended dose, may not pose any ill effect for Indian adults.

AB Earthworms enhance soil functioning and are therefore key species in the soil. Their presence is generally a positive sign for a terrestrial ecosystem, because these species serve as important biomarkers in soil quality evaluations. We describe a novel bioassay, the "dispersal assay," that is a simple and rapid technique for field-based soil quality evaluations. It is based on the premise that earthworms prefer optimal soils if given the choice. Thus, assay tubes containing a reference soil were inserted in target sites, and earthworms were placed into these tubes. According to their soil preference, the earthworms dispersed into the surrounding soil, remained in the initial soil within the tubes, avoided both by crawling up the tube, or died. Furthermore, sensitivity responses to metal concentrations, electrical conductivity, and soil pH were observed in field tests. Although the dispersal assay did not completely match traditional toxicity endpoints such as earthworm survival, we found that it can serve as an in situ screening test for assessing soil quality. Overall, our dispersal assay was relatively rapid (within 24 h), had low levels of variation, and showed high correlations between earthworm behavior and soil physicochemical properties.

AB Pyrethroids are synthetic insecticides widely used in agriculture, public health, and veterinary medicine. Deltamethrin, a type II pyrethroid insecticide, has attracted particular attention because of its frequent use. The mechanisms of the toxicity of most pesticides (including pyrethroids) in nontarget organisms is linked to the production of free radicals, oxidative stress induction, increased lipid peroxidation, and disruption of the total antioxidant potential. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of acute toxicity of 3 different concentrations (8, 16, and 32 mg/kg body wt) of orally applied deltamethrin after 96 h of treatment. Some of the front-line oxidative stress parameters as well as cholinesterase (ChE) activity and cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) expression in the liver, muscle, skin, and gastrointestinal tissue of the adult green toad Bufotes viridis were determined. Compared with the control group, the activity of catalase and glutathione reductase was increased in the liver and skin, while the concentration of sulfhydryl groups was reduced. In the liver and muscle, concentrations of thiobarbituric reactive substances were increased, as well as liver CYP1A expression. In the muscle and skin, glutathione-S-transferase activity was higher in treated toads. The oxidative stress parameters examined were affected by different deltamethrin concentrations. We conclude that the assessed parameters represent good biomarkers of pesticide-induced oxidative stress. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Eggshells are a potential tool for nonlethally sampling contaminant concentrations in bird eggs, yet few studies have examined their utility to represent mercury exposure. We assessed mercury concentrations in eggshell components for 23 bird species and determined whether they correlated with total mercury (THg) in egg contents. We designed a multi-experiment analysis to examine how THg is partitioned into eggshell components, specifically hardened eggshells, material adhered to the eggshells, and inner eggshell membranes. The THg concentrations in eggshells were much lower than in egg contents, and almost all of the THg within the eggshell was contained within material adhered to eggshells and inner eggshell membranes, and specifically not within calcium-rich hardened eggshells. Despite very little mercury in hardened eggshells, THg concentrations in hardened eggshells had the strongest correlation with egg contents among all eggshell components. However, species with the same THg concentrations in eggshells had different THg concentrations in egg contents, indicating that there is no global predictive equation among species for the relationship between eggshell and egg content THg concentrations. Furthermore, for all species, THg concentrations in eggshells decreased with relative embryo age. Although the majority of mercury in eggshells was contained within other eggshell components and not within hardened eggshells, THg in hardened eggshells can be used to estimate THg concentrations in egg contents, if embryo age and species are addressed.

AB The present study investigated the effects of species interactions like competition and (intraguild) predation on the sensitivity of aquatic organisms to the insecticide chlorpyrifos. In the first experiment, combined effects of chlorpyrifos and different levels of intraspecific and interspecific interaction were assessed on Gammarus pulex survival using Asellus aquaticus as an interacting species. Intraspecific and interspecific interactions increased the time to extinction of G. pulex up to a factor of 2, most likely because of the cannibalistic nature of G. pulex and its intraguild predation on A. aquaticus under stress conditions. In the second experiment, combined effects of chlorpyrifos and intraspecific and interspecific interaction were assessed on Daphnia pulex abundance using Brachionus calyciflorus as a competing species and Chaoborus sp. larvae as a predator. Intraspecific and interspecific interactions significantly affected the D. pulex population structure, but they did not influence the total population size. Predation decimated D. pulex abundance; however, interacting effects of predation and chlorpyrifos exposure were less noticeable at high exposure concentrations because of the reduced predatory efficiency of Chaoborus sp. larvae. The present study shows that species interactions do not always increase the vulnerability of aquatic populations to chemical stress and that some interactions (e.g., cannibalism and intraguild predation) or reduced predator grazing pressure can alleviate competition and predation stress on population-level insecticide effects under food-limiting conditions.

AB A comprehensive survey was conducted to assess the possible sources and distribution of metals in the agricultural soils of the Guanzhong Plain in northwest China. In total, 227 samples of agricultural soil were collected to determine the content of Pb, Cr, Co, V, Ni, Zn, Cu, As, and Mn by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The mean concentrations of metals were 26.2 +/- 10.8 mg kg(-1), 71.5 +/- 16.8 mg kg(-1), 12.7 +/- 1.81 mg kg(-1), 85.1 +/- 7.86 mg kg(-1), 30.5 +/- 6.17 mg kg(-1), 71.1 +/- 14.1 mg kg(-1), 25.2 +/- 5.58 mg kg(-1), 12.5 +/- 1.94 mg kg(-1), and 635.4 +/- 84.7 mg kg(-1) for Pb, Cr, Co, V, Ni, Zn, Cu, As, and Mn, respectively-slightly higher than the regional background values. Multivariate analysis was used to identify the metal sources, and it was found that Ni and Cr in the agricultural soils were mainly derived from lithological materials, and Pb, Zn, and Cu were mainly from traffic emissions; however, Zn and Cu also originated from mineral fertilizers or pesticides. The other metals originated from industrial emissions. The Nemerow index coupled with geographic information system technology was applied to assess the degree and spatial distribution of metal contamination; the soils studied were classified as slightly polluted, and the most contaminated regions were concentrated in the area surrounding Xi'an city, as well as areas in the southeast and north of the Guanzhong Plain.

AB Protection of ecosystem services is increasingly emphasized as a risk-assessment goal, but there are wide gaps between current ecological risk-assessment endpoints and potential effects on services provided by ecosystems. The authors present a framework that links common ecotoxicological endpoints to chemical impacts on populations and communities and the ecosystem services that they provide. This framework builds on considerable advances in mechanistic effects models designed to span multiple levels of biological organization and account for various types of biological interactions and feedbacks. For illustration, the authors introduce 2 case studies that employ well-developed and validated mechanistic effects models: the inSTREAM individual-based model for fish populations and the AQUATOX ecosystem model. They also show how dynamic energy budget theory can provide a common currency for interpreting organism-level toxicity. They suggest that a framework based on mechanistic models that predict impacts on ecosystem services resulting from chemical exposure, combined with economic valuation, can provide a useful approach for informing environmental management. The authors highlight the potential benefits of using this framework as well as the challenges that will need to be addressed in future work. (C) 2017 SETAC.

TI Modernizing Water Quality Criteria in the United States: A Need to
   Expand the Definition of Acceptable Data
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB The development of water quality criteria (WQC) for the protection of aquatic life is a fundamental component of the Clean Water Actthe primary US legislation responsible for protecting aquatic ecosystems from pollution. Water quality criteria define acceptable levels of contamination in the environment and thus play an important role in society. Rules for how science is used to develop WQC were created in 1985. Most rely on only data and knowledge obtained through a single methodology, the single-species laboratory toxicity test. Since 1985, understanding of the fate and effects of environmental contaminants has advanced markedly from multiple perspectives and disciplines. However, many of these advances are routinely discarded in WQC development because they do not adhere to data limits imposed by the 1985 guidelines. The present Focus article outlines how multiple lines of inquiry have played important roles in improving understanding of the ecological implications of environmental contaminants. The authors focus on gains in understanding that would not have been possible through traditional toxicity bioassays alone and argue that more robust scientific understanding can be used to modernize WQC development. In particular, the present article highlights ways to increase the relevance of toxicity testing (at different spatiotemporal scales) and incorporate all relevant lines of evidence into WQC modernization.

AB The sensitivity of 15 aquatic species, including primary producers, benthic invertebrates, cladocerans, mollusks, and fish, to MON 0818, a commercial surfactant mixture of polyoxyethylene tallow amines, was evaluated in standard acute (48-96-h) laboratory tests. In addition, the potential for chronic toxicity (8 d) was evaluated with Ceriodaphnia dubia. Exposure concentrations were confirmed. No significant effects on any endpoint were observed in the chronic test. A tier-1 hazard assessment was conducted by comparing species sensitivity distributions based on the generated data, as well as literature data, with 4 exposure scenarios. This assessment showed moderate levels of hazard (43.1% of the species exposed at or above median effective concentration levels), for a chosen worst-case scenariounintentional direct over-spray of a 15-cm-deep body of water with the maximum label application rate for the studied formulations (Roundup Original, Vision Forestry Herbicide; 12L formulation ha(-1), equivalent to 4.27kg acid equivalent [a.e.] ha(-1)). The hazard decreased to impairment of 20.9% of species under the maximum application rate for more typical uses (6L formulation ha(-1), 2.14kga.e.ha(-1)), and down to 6.9% for a more frequently employed application rate (2.5L formulation ha(-1), 0.89kga.e.ha(-1)). Finally, the percentage (3.8%) was less than the hazardous concentration for 5% of the species based on concentrations of MON 0818 calculated from maximum measured concentrations of glyphosate in the environment.

AB Chemical monitoring data sets such as those provided by the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) offer opportunities to evaluate the ecological risks of pesticides under large spatiotemporal scales and to evaluate the protectiveness of the current prospective risk-assessment framework. As a case study, we used the monitoring data set for the insecticide chlorpyrifos to perform a probabilistic risk assessment for Iberian surface-water ecosystems. The specific objectives of the study were 1) to assess the occurrence of chlorpyrifos in relation to different agricultural production land uses, 2) to assess the spatiotemporal variation in the exceedance of the European WFD short- and long-term environmental quality standards (maximum allowable concentration environmental quality standard [MAC-EQS] and annual average [AA] EQS), and 3) to perform a probabilistic risk assessment for freshwater invertebrates. A database that contains chlorpyrifos concentrations from 14 600 surface water samples taken between 2012 and 2017 in the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) was analyzed, and chlorpyrifos was detected in 21% of these samples. The MAC-EQS was exceeded in 2% of the cases, whereas the AA-EQS was exceeded in 18% of the cases. The majority of the exceedances took place in the littoral areas of the eastern and southeastern parts of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in areas with dominant citrus production during late spring, late summer, and autumn. The present study indicates unacceptable risks posed by chlorpyrifos to Iberian surface waters over the study period, although it was approved for use in Europe. The present study supports the need to perform further postregistration monitoring assessments with other pesticides following similar approaches, which can help to identify possible pesticide-misuse practices and improvements of the prospective risk-assessment framework.

AB Sea turtles are exposed to trace elements through water, sediment, and food. Exposure to these elements has been shown to decrease immune function, impair growth, and decrease reproductive output in wildlife. The present study compares trace element concentrations in green turtles in captivity at Sea Life Park Hawaii (n = 6) to wild green turtles in Kapoho Bay, Hawaii, USA (n = 5-7). Blood and scute samples were collected and analyzed for 11 elements via inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Selenium was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the blood of captive turtles compared with wild turtles, whereas V, Ni, and Pb were significantly greater in the blood of wild turtles. In scute, V, Cu, Se, and Cr were significantly greater in captive turtles, whereas As was significantly greater in wild turtles. Pelleted food fed to the captive turtles and representative samples of the wild turtle diet were analyzed via ICP-MS to calculate trophic transfer factors and daily intake values. Wild turtles had greater estimated daily intake than captive turtles for all elements except Cu and Se. Because captive turtles are fed a diet very different from that of their wild counterparts, captive turtles do not represent control or reference samples for chemical exposure studies in wild turtles. No toxic thresholds are known for sea turtles, but rehabilitation and managed care facilities should monitor sea turtle elemental concentrations to ensure the animals' health.

AB The abalone industry has suffered immense economic losses due to the occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Among the methods for mitigating HABs, modified clay is considered the most promising strategy and has been successfully used for field applications in many countries, and its environmental effects have become a subject of global concern. The effects of modified clay on the survival, growth, nutritional quality, and oxidative stress indicators of abalone were studied based on both laboratory and field experiments. The results showed that modified clay at 3-10 times the concentrations used for HAB treatment did not affect the survival of abalone. During the laboratory experiments, the increases in abalone shell length and weight nonsignificantly decreased with increasing concentrations of modified clay at 1-15 d, whereas the weight of abalone in the experimental groups increased rapidly during the recovery period at 16-30 d. The growth and nutrition qualities of abalone in field experiments showed negligible differences between the control and experimental groups. Catalase (CAT) activity in the hepatopancreas and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the gills were significantly affected by certain concentrations of modified clay at individual time points, whereas the malondialdehyde (MDA) content decreased in all experimental groups within 96 h. The removal of bacteria and the mitigation of water quality decline were among the effects of modified clay that contributed to the decrease in MDA content. The present study showed that modified clay had no obvious adverse effects on the survival, growth, quality, or oxidative stress indicators of abalone at the experimental concentrations, thus providing a reference for the field application of modified clay in typical aquaculture areas.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;39:2065-2075.

AB Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are surface-active agents used in diverse industrial and commercial applications. They contaminate both freshwater and marine ecosystems, are highly persistent, and accumulate through trophic transfer. Seabirds are exposed to environmental contaminants due to their high trophic position in food webs and relatively long lifespan. We measured levels of 10 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in egg yolks of yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) breeding in the northern Adriatic Sea (Northeast Italy). We examined variations in PFAAs within clutches (between eggs of different laying order) and among clutches. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most abundant yolk PFAA (mean = 42.0 ng/g wet wt), followed by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; 3.8 ng/g wet wt) and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDa; 2.8 ng/g wet wt). The n-ary sumation PFAAs averaged 57.4 ng/g wet weight, ranging between 26.5 and 115.0 ng/g wet weight. The PFAA levels varied substantially among clutches (0.29-0.79 of the total variation), whereas the effects of laying order were considerably weaker (0.01-0.13). Egg-laying order effects were detected for n-ary sumation PFAAs, PFOS, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA), and PFDoDa, whereby the last-laid eggs exhibited lower PFAA concentrations than early-laid eggs. Our results indicate that seagulls from the northern Adriatic basin deposit measurable amounts of PFAAs in their eggs. The large among-clutches differences in PFAAs suggest that exposure of yellow-legged gull females to these compounds is highly variable.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-10. (c) 2020 SETAC

For E. andrei, formulations and pure compounds had similar toxicity to both endpoints tested. For F. candida, acetamiprid and imidacloprid had different toxicities, with acetamiprid being 4 times more toxic to survival (median lethal concentration [LC50] 0.12 mg active substance [a.s.]/kg dry soil) and imidacloprid being 4 times more toxic to reproduction of the springtail (median effect concentration [EC50] 0.25 mg a.s./kg dry soil) than their commercial formulations. The most toxic compound to E. andrei was acetamiprid (LC50 0.80 and EC50 0.35-0.40 mg a.s./kg), and the most toxic to F. candida was clothianidin (LC50 0.07 and EC50 0.05 mg a.s./kg). Estimated risk ratios indicated that only one application/yr of clothianidin in the formulation Poncho (R) may pose a threat to the populations of springtails and earthworms.

AB Early-life stage (ELS) toxicity tests are recognized as an advancement over current testing methodologies in terms of cost, animal use, and biological relevance. However, standardized ELS tests are not presently available for some vertebrate taxa, including birds. The present study describes a Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) ELS test that is a promising candidate for standardization and applies it to test 8 environmental chemicals (ethinylestradiol, benzo[a]pyrene, chlorpyrifos, fluoxetine, lead(II)nitrate, trenbolone, seleno-L-methionine, hexabromocyclododecane). Individual chemicals were injected into the air cell of unincubated Japanese quail eggs at 3 concentrations, all predicted to cause <= 20% mortality. Survival to embryonic day 16 was consistently high (>90%) among the vehicle-injected controls. All chemicals, except ethinylestradiol, were detected in liver tissue, most at concentrations suggestive of embryonic clearance. Adverse effects were observed for 5 of the 8 chemicals; chlorpyrifos (41.1 mu g/g) significantly increased developmental abnormalities and decreased embryo and gallbladder mass. Ethinylestradiol (54.2 mu g/g) and hexabromocyclododecane (0.02 mu g/g) decreased embryo mass and tarsus length, respectively. Benzo[a]pyrene (0.83 mu g/g) and fluoxetine hydrochloride (32.7 mu g/g) exceeded the 20% mortality cutoff. No effects were observed following lead(II)nitrate, seleno-L-methionine, or trenbolone exposure up to 10.7, 0.07, and 4.4 mu g/g, respectively. Overall, our ELS approach was time- and cost-effective, caused minimal mortality in controls, effectively delivered diverse chemicals to the embryo, and permitted identification of apical outcomes, all of which provide support toward standardization.

AB Amphibians are in global decline, and anthropogenic activities are known leading causes of their demise. Thus the interaction between agriculture and amphibian health has been examined for decades. Many facets of amphibian physiology and ecology place them at high risk among the nontarget organisms affected by agricultural byproducts. Research has shown that many chemicals and fertilizers affect amphibian growth, reproduction, and survival. The impacts differ based on the type of agricultural byproduct (e.g., chemical pesticide or nutrient-heavy fertilizer) and amphibian species, but the effects are usually negative. However, minimal research exists on how organic biopesticides interact with amphibian populations. Biopesticides utilize insecticidal bacteria as the active ingredient in lieu of synthetic chemicals. The inert ingredients present in biopesticide commercial products are considered safe to nontarget organisms. The present study tested the impacts of a commercial biopesticide on the survival of amphibian embryos and larvae. We found that expected environmental concentrations of the microbial biopesticide Monterrey B.t. did not significantly reduce survival in embryos or larvae. However, the higher doses used to assess threshold toxicity levels caused significant mortality. Our data suggest that biopesticides are not directly harmful to amphibian embryos or larvae in concentrations regularly applied for pest control. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;39:155-161. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Environmental contaminants frequently occur as part of a chemical mixture, potentially resulting in competitive inhibition among multiple substrates metabolized by the same enzyme. Trout liver S9 fractions were used to evaluate the biotransformation of 3 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs): phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene, tested as binary mixtures. Initial rates of biotransformation were determined using a substrate-depletion approach. The resulting data were then fitted by simultaneous nonlinear regression to a competitive inhibition model. In each case, the PAH possessing the lower Michaelis-Menten affinity constant (K-M) competitively inhibited biotransformation of the other compound. Inhibition constants determined for the lower-K-M compound were generally close to previously determined K-M values, consistent with the suggestion that phase I biotransformation of PAHs is largely catalyzed by one or a small number of cytochrome P450 enzymes. The use of a substrate-depletion approach to perform enzyme-inhibition studies imposes practical limitations on experimental design and complicates the interpretation of derived kinetic constants. Nevertheless, the resulting information may have utility for chemical hazard assessments as well as the design and interpretation of controlled laboratory studies. Depletion experiments informed by measured chemical concentrations in tissues may also provide a means of determining whether enzyme inhibition occurs under relevant environmental conditions.

AB We report the use of condensed phase-membrane introduction mass spectrometry as a novel method for the determination of acid dissociation constants for hydrophobic organic acids in aqueous solution at nanomolar concentrations. The technique is based on the pH-dependent permeation of analytes through a semipermeable polydimethylsiloxane membrane probe that is immersed directly in aqueous samples. We describe the method and report the dissociation constant (pK(a)) values for compounds of biological and environmental relevance, including contaminants, pharmaceuticals, and naphthenic acids. The approach can be applied to individual compounds, combined suites, and complex mixtures at parts-per-billion levels. We report pK(a) values for 10 carboxylic acids with precision estimates and relative errors (where reliable literature values are available) of <0.1 log units. We report acidity constants for 2-methyl-3-methoxy-4-phenyl butanoic acid (a biomarker for microcystin algal toxins) and 4-t-butylcyclohexane carboxylic acid (a model naphthenic acid) as 4.28 +/- 0.03 and 5.15 +/- 0.05, respectively. Furthermore, we employ this approach to measure the effect of both temperature and deuterium oxide (heavy water) on acid dissociation, reporting the enthalpy and entropy changes for the ionization of a representative carboxylic acid and substituted phenol.

AB The Pampa Humeda region in Argentina is characterized by soybean, wheat, and maize production, with intensive application of agrochemicals such as herbicides and insecticides. We used a joint probabilistic approach to analyze the probabilities for environmental chlorpyrifos concentrations measured in the Pampa Humeda to exceed acute or chronic hazardous concentration for 5% of the species (HC5) values estimated from species sensitivity distributions for aquatic species. Chlorpyrifos concentrations in water ranged from 0.0005 to 10.8 mu g/L, with a median of 0.013 mu g/L. The HC5 limits were 0.0637 mu g/L for acute and 0.0007 mu g/L for chronic effects. The probabilities for chlorpyrifos environmental concentrations to exceed the HC5 values ranged from 35% (acute effects) to 96% (chronic effects). Water quality criteria (WQC) for the protection of aquatic life were also frequently exceeded (by 48-87%) for both acute and chronic effects. Together with published threshold limit values from mesocosm studies, these data suggest that macroinvertebrate communities can be severely affected by the reported environmental concentrations of chlorpyrifos. Indeed, changes in the macroinvertebrate assemblage in the Pampa Humeda have been correlated with chlorpyrifos levels in sediments. Nevertheless, the actual impact needs to be ascertained by assessing the recovery rate of macroinvertebrate populations in this region. Considering the HC5 for chronic effects and the threshold limits for macroinvertebrate community level effects, we propose 0.7 ng/L as a new WQC to effectively protect aquatic life from long-term exposure to chlorpyrifos.

AB Field surveys provide valuable empirical information about the effects of heavy metals on the biological integrity of river ecosystems. To evaluate the effect of nickel (Ni) on aquatic organisms, we conducted field surveys of benthic invertebrates and Ni concentrations at 45 sites in 19 rivers in Japan. We examined the relationships between 11 structural or functional measures of benthic invertebrate communities and free Ni ion concentrations with a 90th quantile regression model. Among the measures, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) richness, total wet biomass of all invertebrates, and total abundance of filter feeders were negatively associated with free Ni ion concentrations. The total abundance of mud burrowers and their percentage contribution to the abundance of all invertebrates as well as the total abundances of collector-gatherers and predators were positively associated with the Ni ion concentrations. The free ion concentrations of Ni associated with a 5% reduction of one of the 3 measures from its 90th quantile value at reference sites (EC5) were estimated to be 0.2 to 7.6 mu g/L. The point estimates of EC5 were similar in order of magnitude to the environmental quality standard for Ni in the European Union. However, the usefulness of simple point estimates of effective concentrations based on quantile regression lines should be carefully examined because the uncertainties in our EC5 values were large.

Pesticides can affect development of amphibians and suppress the immune system, which could impact disease susceptibility and tolerance. No previous studies on amphibians have examined the effects of these insecticides on differential blood cell proportions or concentrations of corticosterone (a general stress hormone). We investigated the effects of chronic exposure to 2 neonicotinoids, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, on immunometrics of wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus). Frogs were exposed to single, chronic treatments of 2.5 or 250 mu g/L of clothianidin or thiamethoxam for 7 wk from Gosner stages 25 to 46. The juvenile frogs were then maintained for 3 wk post metamorphosis without exposure to neonicotinoids. We measured water-borne corticosterone twice: at 6 d and 8 wk after exposure in larval and juvenile frogs, respectively. We assessed differential blood cell profiles from juvenile frogs. Corticosterone was significantly lower in tadpoles exposed to 250 mu g/L of thiamethoxam compared with other tadpole treatments, but no significant differences in corticosterone concentrations were found in treatments using juvenile frogs. Anemia was detected in all treatments compared with controls with the exception of tadpoles exposed to 2.5 mu g/L of clothianidin. Neutrophil-to-leukocyte and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios were elevated in frogs exposed to 250 mu g/L of thiamethoxam. Collectively, these results indicate that chronic exposure to neonicotinoids has varied impacts on blood cell profiles and corticosterone concentrations of developing wood frogs, which are indicative of stress. Future studies should investigate whether exposure to neonicotinoids increases susceptibility to infection by parasites in both larval and adult wood frogs. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1273-1284.

AB Asia, especially China, shares a large proportion of global aquaculture production. Consequently, aquaculture food quality and safety with regard to contamination with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were assessed in eastern China, which is a typical area of aquaculture. The concentrations of n-ary sumation PAHs ranged from 42 to 600 ng/g dry weight in a variety of dietary species from farm ponds in eastern China. With regard to the total daily intake of PAHs estimated based on the literature data on urinary hydroxy-PAHs in this region, there was a significant difference between children (mean = 130 ng/kg/d) and adults (mean = 600 ng/kg/d for pregnant women, 1700 ng/kg/d for women, and 2300 ng/kg/d for men). Furthermore, we provided a novel estimation on the fractional contribution of aquatic products to the overall human daily intake of PAHs. Specifically, the contribution of aquatic foodstuffs to total daily intake for children and pregnant women reached more than 50 and 10%, respectively, indicating that children and pregnant women were more vulnerable to the PAH-contaminated aquaculture foodstuffs. Meanwhile, no significant region-specific pattern between different provinces was observed. In summary, these results suggested that sensitive subpopulations were vulnerable to exposure to PAH-contaminated aquatic products, and it is necessary to pay attention to the dietary intake pattern of these sensitive subgroups in eastern China.

AB Fish (embryo) toxicity test guidelines are mostly based on aquatic exposures. However, in some cases, other exposure routes can be more practical and relevant. Micro-injection into the yolk of fish embryos could offer a particular advantage for administering hydrophobic compounds, such as many endocrine disruptors. Single-dose micro-injection was compared with continuous aquatic exposure in terms of compound accumulation and biological responses. 17 alpha-Ethinyl estradiol (EE2) was used as a model compound. First, the optimal solvent and droplet size were optimized, and needle variation was assessed. Next, biological endpoints were evaluated. The accumulated internal dose of EE2 decreased over time in both exposure scenarios. Estrogen receptor activation was concentration/injected dose dependent, increased daily, and was related to esr2b transcription. Transcription of vitellogenin 1 (vtg1) and brain aromatase (cyp19a1b) was induced in both scenarios, but the cyp19a1b transcription pattern differed between routes. Injection caused an increase in cyp19a1b transcripts from 48 hours post fertilization (hpf) onward, whereas after aquatic exposure the main increase occurred between 96 and 120 hpf. Some malformations only occurred after injection, whereas others were present for both scenarios. We conclude that responses can differ between exposure routes and therefore micro-injection is not a direct substitute for, but can be complementary to aquatic exposure. Nevertheless, vtg1and cyp19a1b transcription and estrogen receptor activation are suitable biomarkers for endocrine disruptor screening in both scenarios. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:533-547.

AB Water monitoring is of great importance, especially for water bodies in agricultural or industrial areas. Grab sampling is a widely used technique for aquatic monitoring but represents only a snapshot of the contaminant levels at a specific point in time. Passive sampling, on the other hand, is an integrative technique that provides an average concentration of contaminants representative of its deployment period. Thus, the current contamination by organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and some currently used pesticides was assessed along the Quequen Grande River watershed (Argentina) using the integrative silicone rubber passive sampling technique in a year-long study. Silicone rubber samplers were deployed at 6 sampling sites selected according to different land uses (agricultural-livestock production, agricultural and urban activities) during 3 periods in 2014 and 2015. The organochlorine pesticides were dominated by endosulfan (sum of alpha-, beta-endosulfan, endosulfan sulfate = 0.15-23.4 ng/L). The highest endosulfan levels were registered during the pesticide application period (December-March), exceeding the international water quality guidelines for protecting freshwater biota (3 ng/L). Compared with previous reports, no reductions in endosulfan levels were observed at the Quequen Grande River watershed. These results would suggest the illegal use of remaining stocks because water sampling was carried out after endosulfan was banned in Argentina. Chlorpyrifos was the second major pesticide found in water (0.02-4.3 ng/L), associated with its widespread usage on soybean crops. A reduction in levels of legacy pesticides (heptachlors, DDTs, dieldrin, and chlordanes) was evident compared with previous reports from 2007. Levels of PCBs were very low, indicating that probably only minor diffuse sources were still available along the Quequen Grande River watershed. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:340-349. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB A review of the literature on oil toxicity tests showed a high diversity of reported test methods that may affect the composition, stability, and toxicity of oil solutions. Concentrations of oil in test solutions are dynamic because hydrocarbons evaporate, partition to test containers, bioaccumulate, biodegrade, and photo-oxidize. As a result, the composition and toxicity of test solutions may vary widely and create significant obstacles to comparing toxicity among studies and to applying existing data to new risk assessments. Some differences in toxicity can be resolved if benchmarks are based on measured concentrations of hydrocarbons in test solutions, highlighting the key role of chemical analyses. However, analyses have often been too infrequent to characterize rapid and profound changes in oil concentrations and composition during tests. The lack of practical methods to discriminate particulate from dissolved oil may also contribute to underestimating toxicity. Overall, current test protocols create uncertainty in toxicity benchmarks, with a high risk of errors in measured toxicity. Standard oil toxicity tests conducted in parallel with tests under site-specific conditions would provide an understanding of how test methods and conditions affect measured oil toxicity. Development of standard test methods could be achieved by collaborations among university, industry, and government scientists to define methods acceptable to all 3 sectors.

AB Nickel (Ni) concentrations in aquatic ecosystems can be amplified by anthropogenic activities including resource extraction. Compared with fish and invertebrates, knowledge of Ni toxicity in amphibians is limited, especially for northern species. We examined the effect of Ni on wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles, the species with the widest and most northern distribution of any anuran in North America. Wood frog tadpoles were exposed to a Ni concentration gradient (0.02-5.5mg/L of Ni at 164mg/L as CaCO3 water hardness) for 8d and examined for lethality, Ni bioaccumulation, and several sublethal endpoints including body condition, food consumption, activity, and chemosensory function. Nickel induced a sublethal effect on body condition (8-d 10 and 20% effect concentrations [EC10 and EC20] of 1.07 +/- 0.38 and 2.44 +/- 0.51mg/L of Ni +/- standard error [SE], respectively) but not on food consumption, activity, or chemosensory function. Nickel accumulation in tadpole tissues was positively related to an increase in aqueous Ni concentration but was not lethal. Both the acute and chronic US Environmental Protection Agency water quality guideline concentrations for Ni (0.71 and 0.08mg/L at 164mg/L as CaCO3 water hardness, respectively) were protective against lethal and sublethal effects in wood frog tadpoles. In the present study, wood frog tadpoles were protected by current water quality guidelines for Ni and are likely not as useful as other taxa for environmental effects monitoring for this particular metal.

ID PESTICIDE DISSIPATION; HALF-LIVES; RAIN; PERSISTENCE; RESIDUES
AB In the environmental risk assessment for plant protection products in the European Union a default foliar dissipation half-life (DT50) of 10d is used for the risk assessment of herbivorous birds and mammals feeding on sprayed foliage. This generic DT50 of 10d is based on a compilation of residue trials conducted over 30yr ago, in which many compounds and formulations were considered that are not used anymore. We therefore reassessed foliar dissipation based on a data set of 396 residue trials covering 30 compounds. Foliar DT50s were calculated, and potential factors determining dissipation were analyzed, such as crop group, residue zone, and rainfall. The strongest source of variability was found between individual trials. Other factors, including the residue zone and crop group, did not have a significant impact on dissipation. Only heavy rainfall (>6.5mm/d, i.e., the 95th percentile of rainfall) had a statistically significant influence, although rainfall explained only approximately 5% of the overall variability. Moderate rainfall (6.5mm/d) did not significantly correlate with dissipation and explained only 0.1% of the overall variability. Most importantly, the differences in DT50s between crops and residue zones were neither marked nor statistically significant; hence, trials from different residue zones and crops could be pooled to obtain more robust half-lives. Over all compounds, trials, zones, and crops the geometric mean DT50 was 3.2d (90th percentile 7.9d). Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:1926-1932. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Using a coupled method of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) exposure with aquatic organism bioassays, we assessed the use of DGT as a tool for estimating copper (Cu) bioavailability in contaminated waters. The DGT-accumulated Cu fraction could possibly be used as a surrogate for other assessments of metal bioavailability. The Cu concentrations in fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) and yellow lampmussel (Lampsilis cariosa) soft tissue were compared with DGT-accumulated Cu after 2, 4, and 6 d of exposure to a Cu concentration series in static, water-only assays. The DGT-accumulated Cu was found to include free Cu ions, labile inorganic Cu complexes, and labile dissolved organic matter Cu complexes, compared with Cu speciation output from the biotic ligand model. Regressions of Cu concentrations between DGT and fathead minnow at 4 and 6d of exposure demonstrated linear relationships. The Cu bioaccumulated in yellow lampmussel was overpredicted by DGT at Cu concentrations greater than 10 mu gL(-1), which may be caused by internal regulation of Cu. The speciation component of the biotic ligand model predicted relationships between inorganic Cu and animal-accumulated Cu that were similar to predicted relationships between DGT-indicated Cu and animal-accumulated Cu at all deployment durations.

AB Organic carbon principally controls sorption and desorption of hydrophobic organic compounds in sediments. We investigated the effects of organic carbon type and quantity on compound bioaccessibility. The desorption of 21 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners was determined in spiked sediments amended with black carbon, humic acid, and sawdust at either 3 or 6% organic carbon. Desorption parameters were determined using Tenax sequential extractions and then modeled as operationally defined rapid, slow, and very slow fractions and rate constants. The effects of the amendments on PCB bioaccumulation were also evaluated using Lumbriculus variegatus. The lowest and highest PCB bioaccessibilities were observed in the black carbon and sawdust amendments, respectively. The total amount of PCBs desorbed ranged from 3 to 27% for the black carbon amendments, 12 to 55% for humic acid amendments, 16 to 80% for sawdust amendments, and 35 to 89% for controls. The results also showed that desorption of PCBs was slower in 6% amendments than 3% amendments, and this finding was most evident in humic acid and black carbon amendments. Overall, the trend in PCB bioaccumulation was similar to what was found for compound desorption in that the highest PCB bioaccumulation was observed in controls and sawdust amendments, whereas humic acid and black carbon amendments showed lower bioaccumulation. Finally, the 24-h single-point Tenax and bioaccumulation data were fit to a Tenax regression model. The PCB bioaccumulation was effectively predicted by the model, with 80% of the data falling within the 95% confidence intervals. (C) 2018 SETAC

AB Comprehensive experimental quantification and mapping of the aggregation and dispersion state of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) in the presence of humic substances is a great challenge. Dissipative particle dynamic (DPD) simulation was adopted to investigate the aggregation and dispersion mechanisms of NPs in the presence of a humic substance analog. Twelve different types of NPs including 2 metal-based NPs, 7 metal oxide-based NPs, and 3 carbon-based NPs in pure water (pH 3.0) and algae medium (pH 8.0) in the presence of a humic substance analogy were selected for experimental verification of the DPD simulation results. In agreement with results obtained with dynamic light scattering and phase analysis light scattering techniques, the simulations demonstrated that the presence of humic substances reduced the aggregation extent of the NPs. The DPD simulations showed that the stability and dispersity of the NPs increased first, and then decreased with increasing concentrations of humic substances. Moreover, there existed a concentration of humic substances where the NPs became more stable and more dispersed, which was experimentally verified in the case of all the NPs in the pure water and in the algae medium. Furthermore, theory and simulation indicate that both hydrophobic and hydrogen interaction play an important role in controlling the formation of NP aggregates in the presence of humic substances. Electrostatic interaction and steric repulsion are the main mechanisms underlying the effects of humic substances on the aqueous dispersion stability of NPs. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Testing for acute fish toxicity is an integral part of the environmental safety assessment of chemicals. A true replacement of primary fish tissue was recently proposed using cell viability in a fish gill cell line (RTgill-W1) as a means of predicting acute toxicity, showing good predictivity on 35 chemicals. To promote regulatory acceptance, the predictivity and applicability domain of novel tests need to be carefully evaluated on chemicals with existing high-quality in vivo data. We applied the RTgill-W1 cell assay to 38 fragrance chemicals with a wide range of both physicochemical properties and median lethal concentration (LC50) values and representing a diverse range of chemistries. A strong correlation (R-2=0.90-0.94) between the logarithmic in vivo LC50 values, based on fish mortality, and the logarithmic in vitro median effect concentration (EC50) values based on cell viability was observed. A leave-one-out analysis illustrates a median under-/overprediction from in vitro EC50 values to in vivo LC50 values by a factor of 1.5. This assay offers a simple, accurate, and reliable alternative to in vivo acute fish toxicity testing for chemicals, presumably acting mainly by a narcotic mode of action. Furthermore, the present study provides validation of the predictivity of the RTgill-W1 assay on a completely independent set of chemicals that had not been previously tested and indicates that fragrance chemicals are clearly within the applicability domain.

AB The widespread use of copper nanomaterials (CuNMs) as antibacterial and antifouling agents in consumer products increases the risk for metal contamination and adverse effects in aquatic environments. Information gaps exist on the potential toxicity of CuNMs in marine environments. We exposed field-collected marine meio-and macrobenthic communities to sediments spiked with micronized copper azole (MCA) using a novel method that brings intact benthic cores into the laboratory and exposes the organisms via surface application of sediments. Treatments included field and laboratory controls, 3 spiked sediments: low-MCA (51.9mg/kg sediment), high-MCA (519mg/kg sediment), and CuSO4 (519mg/kg sediment). In addition, single-species acute testing was performed with both MCA and CuSO4. Our results indicate that meio-and macrofaunal assemblages exposed to High-MCA and CuSO4 treatments differed significantly from both the laboratory control and the low-MCA treatments. Differences in macrofauna were driven by decreases in 3 Podocopa ostracod species, the bivalve Gemma gemma, and the polychaetes Exogone verugera and Prionospio heterobranchia relative to the laboratory control. Differences in the meiofaunal community are largely driven by nematodes. The benthic community test results were more sensitive than the single-species test results. Findings of this investigation indicate that CuNMs represent a source of risk to marine benthic communities comparable to that of dissolved Cu.

AB Organs and tissues of whitefish and trout from mercury (Hg)-polluted Lake Ontario were analyzed for Hg isotopes, methylmercury (CH3Hg+), and inorganic Hg to investigate possible mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) and mass-independent fractionation (MIF) of Hg isotopes by physiological processes of the fish. Isotope signatures of different body parts were defined by delta-values of Hg-198/Hg-202, Hg-199/Hg-202, Hg-200/Hg-202, and Hg-201/Hg-202 ratios and by Delta-values representing effects of MIF on Hg-199/Hg-202 and Hg-201/Hg-202 ratios. The research yielded the following evidence for MDF and MIF, including MIF of isotopes with even as well as odd mass numbers, by metabolic activities: 1) anomalously low delta-values for whitefish kidneys but not for trout kidneys; 2) widely varying differences between the delta-values of different body parts of whitefish but practically uniform differences for those of trout; 3) different relationships between Delta Hg-199 and Delta Hg-201 for whitefish than for trout; 4) nonlinear correlation between delta Hg-198 and delta Hg-200 for whitefish but linear correlation for trout; 5) an inverse correlation between the delta Hg-199 values and CH3Hg+ concentrations of whitefish and trout; 6) an inverse correlation between the delta Hg-201/delta Hg-199 and CH3Hg+/inorganic Hg ratios of trout kidneys and gills (and lipids of trout near the sources of pollution) but a positive correlation for muscle, liver, and gut; and 7) inverse correlations between Delta Hg-199 and the CH3Hg+/inorganic Hg ratio for trout liver, kidneys, and gut.

AB Run-of-river dams produce lower greenhouse gas emissions than large hydropower projects, but there is a paucity of research on their potential ecotoxicological impacts through disruption of natural flow regimes. We used stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta S-34) to reconstruct diet and trace methylmercury in a predatory river-resident passerine, the American dipper (Cinclus mexicanus), at 7 regulated and 6 free-flowing mountain streams in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Assimilated diets were comparable among regulated and unregulated streams, dominated by benthic macroinvertebrates and resident freshwater fish, with negligible contributions from anadromous Pacific salmon. Although invertebrates at unregulated streams were isotopically similar along their gradient, dippers and invertebrates sampled below dams on regulated streams had S-34-depleted tissues, suggesting increased activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria and more Hg methylation below the dams. Mercury concentrations in dipper blood (417.6 +/- 74.1 standard error [SE] ng/g wet wt at regulated streams, 340.7 +/- 42.7 SE ng/g wet wt at unregulated streams) and feathers (1564.6 +/- 367.2 SE ng/g dry wt regulated, 1149.0 +/- 152.1 SE ng/g dry wt unregulated), however, were not significantly different between stream types. Relative to other passerines across western North America, dippers in these densely forested mountain streams experienced high mercury exposure; and one recently regulated stream supported dippers with mercury concentrations of potential toxicity concern (up to 8459.5 ng/g dry wt in feathers and 1824.6 ng/g wet wt in whole blood). Elevated mercury in dippers is likely attributable to the birds' relatively high trophic position and high regional inorganic mercury deposition; however, biogeochemical conditions in reservoirs of some regulated streams may be contributing to methylmercury production.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY

DT Article
DE Aluminum; Bioavailability; Multiple linear regression model; Water
   quality guideline
AB The bioavailability of aluminum (Al) to freshwater aquatic organisms varies as a function of several water chemistry parameters, including pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and water hardness. We evaluated the ability of multiple linear regression (MLR) models to predict chronic Al toxicity to a green alga (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata), a cladoceran (Ceriodaphnia dubia), and a fish (Pimephales promelas) as a function of varying DOC, pH, and hardness conditions. The MLR models predicted toxicity values that were within a factor of 2 of observed values in 100% of the cases for P. subcapitata (10 and 20% effective concentrations [EC10s and EC20s]), 91% of the cases for C. dubia (EC10s and EC20s), and 95% (EC10s) and 91% (EC20s) of the cases for P. promelas. The MLR models were then applied to all species with Al toxicity data to derive species and genus sensitivity distributions that could be adjusted as a function of varying DOC, pH, and hardness conditions (the P. subcapitata model was applied to algae and macrophytes, the C. dubia model was applied to invertebrates, and the P. promelas model was applied to fish). Hazardous concentrations to 5% of the species or genera were then derived in 2 ways: 1) fitting a log-normal distribution to species-mean EC10s for all species (following the European Union methodology), and 2) fitting a triangular distribution to genus-mean EC20s for animals only (following the US Environmental Protection Agency methodology). Overall, MLR-based models provide a viable approach for deriving Al water quality guidelines that vary as a function of DOC, pH, and hardness conditions and are a significant improvement over bioavailability corrections based on single parameters.

AB The increased use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has resulted in their ubiquitous presence in the environment. The toxicological properties of these 2 widely prescribed NSAIDs, namely racemic ketoprofen and its enantiomer S(+)-ketoprofen (dexketoprofen), were evaluated, firstly, by acute and chronic toxicity tests using 3 representative model organisms (Vibrio fischeri, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and Ceriodaphnia dubia) and, secondly, by evaluating the responses of biotransformation systems and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP1/MRP2) using the Poeciliopsis lucida hepatocellular carcinoma 1 (PLHC-1) fish hepatic cell line. Toxicity data from both acute and chronic dexketoprofen exposure indicated higher sensitivity through inhibition of bioluminescence and algal growth and through increased mortality/immobilization compared to racemic ketoprofen exposure. The growth inhibition test showed that racemic ketoprofen and dexketoprofen exhibited different effect concentration values (240.2 and 65.6 mu g/L, respectively). Furthermore, racemic ketoprofen and dexketoprofen did not exert cytotoxic effects in PLHC-1 cells and produced compound-, time-, and concentration-specific differential effects on cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) and glutathione S-transferase levels. For CYP1A, the effects of racemic ketoprofen and dexketoprofen differed at the transcriptional and catalytic levels. Exposure to racemic ketoprofen and dexketoprofen modulated MRP1 and MRP2 mRNA levels, and these effects were also dependent on compound, exposure time, and concentration of the individual drug. The present study revealed for the first time the interactions between these NSAIDs and key detoxification systems and different sensitivity to the racemic mixture compared to its enantiomer.

AB Concentrations of halogenated phenolic compounds were measured in the plasma of brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) from 4 Canadian Areas of Concern (AOCs), to assess exposure to suspected thyroid-disrupting chemicals. Hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) were detected in every sample collected in 3 of the AOCs; the detection frequency was lower in samples from the Detroit River AOC. The OH-PCBs most frequently detected were pentachloro, hexachloro, and heptachloro congeners, which are structurally similar to thyroid hormones. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was detected at highest concentrations (1.8 ng/g) in fish from Prince Edward Bay, the Bay of Quinte Lake reference site, and Hillman Marsh (the Wheatley Harbour reference site), suggesting local sources of contamination. Elevated PCP concentrations were also detected in the plasma of brown bullhead from exposed sites in the Toronto and RegionAOC (0.4-0.6 ng/g). Triclosan was consistently detected in the Toronto and RegionAOC (0.05-0.9 ng/g), consistent with wastewater emission. Greater concentrations were occasionally detected in the plasma of brown bullhead from the Bay of Quinte AOC. Concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers were highest in the Toronto and Region AOC, and at 2 of the Bay of Quinte AOC exposed sites near Trenton and Belleville. Distribution patterns reflected the properties and usage of the compounds under investigation and the characteristics of each AOC. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Superfund sites may be a source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to the surrounding environment. These sites can also act as PAH sinks from present-day anthropogenic activities, especially in urban locations. Understanding PAH transport across environmental compartments helps to define the relative contributions of these sources and is therefore important for informing remedial and management decisions. In the present study, paired passive samplers were co-deployed at sediment-water and water-air interfaces within the Portland Harbor Superfund Site and the McCormick and Baxter Superfund Site. These sites, located along the Willamette River (Portland, OR, USA), have PAH contamination from both legacy and modern sources. Diffusive flux calculations indicate that the Willamette River acts predominantly as a sink for low molecular weight PAHs from both the sediment and the air. The sediment was also predominantly a source of 4- and 5-ring PAHs to the river, and the river was a source of these same PAHs to the air, indicating that legacy pollution may be contributing to PAH exposure for residents of the Portland urban center. At the remediated McCormick and Baxter Superfund Site, flux measurements highlight locations within the sand and rock sediment cap where contaminant breakthrough is occurring. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB The European Water Framework Directive prescribes that the environmental quality standards for nickel in surface waters should be based on bioavailable concentrations. Biotic ligand models (BLMs) are powerful tools to account for site-specific bioavailability within risk assessments. Several BLMs and simplified tools are available. For nickel, most of them are based on the same toxicity dataset and chemical speciation methodology as laid down in the 2008 European Union Environmental Risk Assessment Report (RAR). Since then, further insights into the toxic effects of nickel on aquatic species have been gained, and new data and methodologies have been generated and implemented using the predicted-no-effect-concentration (PNEC)-pro tool. The aim of the present study is to provide maximum transparency on data revisions and how this affects the derived environmental quality standards. A case study with 7 different ecoregions was used to determine differences in species sensitivity distributions and in hazardous concentrations for 5% of the species (HC5) values between the original Ni-RAR BLMs and the PNEC-pro BLMs. The BLM parameters used were pH dependent, which extended the applicability domain of PNEC-pro up to a pH of 8.7 for surface waters. After inclusion of additional species and adjustment for cross-species extrapolation, the HC5s were well within the prediction range of the RAR. Based on the latest data and scientific insights, transfer functions in the user-friendly PNEC-pro tool have been updated accordingly without compromising the original considerations of the Ni-RAR.

AB The sensitivity of wild rice (Zizania palustris) to sulfide is not well understood. Because sulfate in surface waters is reduced to sulfide by anaerobic bacteria in sediments and historical information indicated that 10 mg/L sulfate in Minnesota (USA) surface water reduced Z. palustris abundance, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency established 10 mg/L sulfate as a water quality criterion in 1973. A 21-d daily-renewal hydroponic study was conducted to evaluate sulfide toxicity to wild rice and the potential mitigation of sulfide toxicity by iron (Fe). The hydroponic design used hypoxic test media for seed and root exposure and aerobic headspace for the vegetative portion of the plant. Test concentrations were 0.3, 1.6, 3.1, 7.8, and 12.5 mg/L sulfide in test media with 0.8, 2.8, and 10.8 mg/L total Fe used to evaluate the impact of iron on sulfide toxicity. Visual assessments (i.e., no plants harvested) of seed activation, mesocotyl emergence, seedling survival, and phytoxicity were conducted 10 d after dark-phase exposure. Each treatment was also evaluated for time to 30% emergence (ET30), total plant biomass, root and shoot lengths, and signs of phytotoxicity at study conclusion (21 d). The results indicate that exposure of developing wild rice to sulfide at >= 3.1 mg sulfide/L in the presence of 0.8 mg/L Fe reduced mesocotyl emergence. Sulfide toxicity was mitigated by the addition of Fe at 2.8 mg/L and 10.8 mg/L relative to the control value of 0.8 mg Fe/L, demonstrating the importance of iron in mitigating sulfide toxicity to wild rice. Ultimately, determination of site-specific sulfate criteria taking into account factors that alter toxicity, including sediment Fe and organic carbon, are necessary. (C) 2017 SETAC.

AB Windows of exposure to a weathered Deepwater Horizon oil sample (slick A) were examined for early life stage mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus) to determine whether there are developmental periods of enhanced sensitivity during the course of a standard 96-h bioassay. Survival was assessed at 96 h following oil exposures ranging from 2 h to 96 h and targeting 3 general periods of development, namely the prehatch phase, the period surrounding hatch, and the posthatch phase. In addition, 3 different oil preparations were used: high-and low-energy water accommodated fractions of oil and very thin surface slicks of oil (similar to 1 mu m). The latter 2 were used to distinguish between effects due to direct contact with the slick itself and the water underlying the slick. Considering the data from all 3 exposure regimes, it was determined that the period near or including hatch was likely the most sensitive. Furthermore, toxicity was not enhanced by direct contact with slick oil. These findings are environmentally relevant given that the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons eliciting mortality from exposures during the sensitive periods of development were below or near concentrations measured during the active spill phase.

AB Riparian spiders are being used increasingly to track spatial patterns of contaminants in and fluxing from aquatic ecosystems. However, our understanding of the circumstances under which spiders are effective sentinels of aquatic pollution is limited. The present study tests the hypothesis that riparian spiders may be effectively used to track spatial patterns of sediment pollution by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in aquatic ecosystems with high habitat heterogeneity. The spatial pattern of SPCB concentrations in 2 common families of riparian spiders sampled in 2011 to 2013 generally tracked spatial variation in sediment SPCBs across all sites within the Manistique River Great Lakes Area of Concern (AOC), a rivermouth ecosystem located on the south shore of the Upper Peninsula, Manistique (MI, USA) that includes harbor, river, backwater, and lake habitats. Sediment SPCB concentrations normalized for total organic carbon explained 41% of the variation in lipid-normalized spider SPCB concentrations across 11 sites. Furthermore, 2 common riparian spider taxa (Araneidae and Tetragnathidae) were highly correlated (r(2) > 0.78) and had similar mean SPCB concentrations when averaged across all years. The results indicate that riparian spiders may be useful sentinels of relative PCB availability to aquatic and riparian food webs in heterogeneous aquatic ecosystems like rivermouths where habitat and contaminant variability may make the use of aquatic taxa less effective. Furthermore, the present approach appears robust to heterogeneity in shoreline development and riparian vegetation that support different families of large web-building spiders.

TI APPROPRIATE EXPOSURE ESTIMATES FOR WILDLIFE RISK ASSESSMENTS OF CROP

DT Article

AB The registration of pesticides follows guidance published by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). As a default, the EFSA guidance document on risk assessment for birds and mammals assumes that animals feed exclusively on pesticide-treated fields. However, the guidance document suggests refining the risk via the proportion of food animals obtain from a treated field or specific crop (expressed via the portion of diet obtained from a treated area [PT value]). The EFSA guidance equalizes the portion of food taken from a treated area per day with the portion of time spent potentially foraging over the course of a day within this area. Therefore, radiotracking is commonly used to gather species-, crop-, and season-specific PT data, and radio telemetry of continuously tracked farmland species can deliver individual PT values for a given day, crop, and species. In the present study the authors introduce a way of calculating long-term PT values based on empirically recorded data via telemetry field studies for the most appropriate use in wildlife risk assessment of pesticides. The novel aspect of the proposal is that the authors follow the prerequisite given by EFSA to cover the long-term risk by introducing 21-d PT values that aim to cover both intra-and inter-individual variability of foraging focal farmland species in cropped habitats. Currently, the intra-individual variability is not taken into account for PT calculations. The authors demonstrate this approach and discuss EFSA guidance input requirements for PT values recorded in field studies, based on a PT field study conducted with woodpigeons (Columba palumbus) radiotracked in an agricultural landscape in the United Kingdom. The results indicate that a 21-d PT value considering intra-individual variability gives a more appropriate PT value for long-term risk assessments. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Remediation of soils elevated in trace metals so that the soils may provide ecosystems services is typically achieved through pH adjustment or addition of sorbents. The present study aimed to generate higher-tier in situ toxicity data for elevated nickel (Ni) in soils with and without lime addition and to explore the effect of liming on soil chemistry and bioavailability of Ni to plants. A multiyear study of agronomic yield of field-grown oat and soybean occurred in 3 adjacent fields that had received air emissions from a Ni refinery for 66yr. The soil Ni concentration in the plots ranged between 1300mg/kg and 4900mg/kg, and each field was amended with either 50Mg/ha, 10Mg/ha, or 0Mg/ha (or tonnes/ha) of crushed dolomitic limestone. As expected, liming raised the pH of the soils and subsequently reduced the plant availability of Ni. Toxicity thresholds (effective concentrations causing 50% reduction in growth) for limed soils supported the hypothesis that liming reduces toxicity. Relationships were found between relative yield and soil cation exchange capacity and between relative yield and soil pH, corroborating findings of the European Union Risk Assessments and the Metals in Asia studies, respectively. Higher tier ecotoxicity data such as these are a valuable contribution to risk assessment for Ni in soils. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Sucrose as a carbon source in axenic tests affects plant growth and physiology. The high sucrose concentration in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline 238 for the submerged growing aquatic plant Myriophyllum spicatum might modify pollutant effects, thus impairing environmental risk assessment. In a factorial design experiment with axenic M. spicatum exposed to 3 sucrose concentrations (no, low, and high) with or without cadmium, growth, dry matter content, content in pigments or phenolic compounds, and elemental stoichiometry of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) were measured. The results show that sucrose is crucial for growth but can be used at lower concentrations than currently considered. Sucrose-treated plants had higher dry matter content and C content but lower contents of chlorophyll and N. Cadmium affected the content in chlorophyll, phenolic compounds, and elemental stoichiometry. Interactive effects were observed on length growth, C and N content, and the C: N and N: P molar ratios. Remarkably, cadmium led to increased shoot length at low, but not at high, sucrose concentration. This contrasting effect might result from differences in osmotic potential caused by sucrose. Overall, the results suggest a strong effect of sucrose concentration on the growth and physiology of M. spicatum and modifications of the response to cadmium. Further studies should establish the lowest (C) 2016 SETAC.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) has shown promise as a tool to control movements of invasive Asian carp, but its effects on native freshwater biota have not been well studied. The authors evaluated lethal and sublethal responses of juvenile fatmucket (Lampsilis siliquoidea) mussels to CO2 at levels (43-269 mg/L, mean concentration) that bracket concentrations effective for deterring carp movement. The 28-d lethal concentration to 50% of the mussels was 87.0 mg/L (95% confidence interval [CI] 78.4-95.9) and at 16-d postexposure, 76.0 mg/L (95% CI 62.9-90.3). A proportional hazards regression model predicted that juveniles could not survive CO2 concentrations > 160 mg/L for more than 2 wk or > 100 mg/L CO2 for more than 30 d. Mean shell growth was significantly lower for mussels that survived CO2 treatments. Growth during the postexposure period did not differ among treatments, indicating recovery of the mussels. Also, CO2 caused shell pitting and erosion. Behavioral effects of CO2 included movement of mussels to the substrate surface and narcotization at the highest concentrations. Mussels in the 110 mg/L mean CO2 treatment had the most movements in the first 3 d of exposure. If CO2 is infused continuously as a fish deterrent, concentrations < 76 mg/L are recommended to prevent juvenile mussel mortality and shell damage. Mussels may survive and recover from brief exposure to higher concentrations. Published 2016 Wiley Periodicals Inc. on behalf of SETAC.

AB Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and pharmaceutical compounds are classified by the US Environmental Protection Agency as contaminants of emerging concern, with significant research devoted to determining their potential environmental and toxicological effects. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes are known to have a high adsorptive capacity for organic contaminants, leading to potential uses in water remediation; however, there is concern that co-exposure with MWCNTs may alter the bioavailability of organic compounds. Existing studies investigating MWCNT/organic contaminant co-exposures have shown conflicting results, and no study to date has examined the combined effects of MWCNTs and a common pharmaceutical. In the present study, juvenile fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed to sublethal concentrations of the over-the-counter antihistamine diphenhydramine (DPH) in the presence of natural sediment for 10 d, with some treatment groups receiving MWCNTs. Addition of MWCNTs did not have a protective effect on DPH-related growth inhibition, and did not reduce the whole-body burden of DPH in exposed fish. Mass-balance calculations indicated that significant amounts of DPH were adsorbed to MWCNTs, and DPH concentrations in water and sediment were commensurately reduced. Bioconcentration factor and biota-sediment accumulation factor increased in the presence of MWCNTs, indicating that P. promelas accumulates DPH adsorbed to MWCNTs in sediment, likely by co-ingestion of MWCNTs during feeding from the sediment surface.

AB Histopathology of testicular tissue is considered to be the most sensitive tool to detect adverse effects on male reproduction. When assessing tissue damage, seminiferous epithelium needs to be classified into different stages to detect certain cell damages; but stage identification is a demanding task. The authors present a method to identify the 12 stages in mink testicular tissue. The staging system uses Gata-4 immunohistochemistry to visualize acrosome development and proved to be both intraobserver-reproducible and interobserver-reproducible with a substantial agreement of 83.6% (kappa=0.81) and 70.5% (kappa=0.67), respectively. To further advance and objectify this method, they present a computerized staging system that identifies these 12 stages. This program has an agreement of 52.8% (kappa 0.47) with the consensus staging by 2 investigators. The authors propose a pooling of the stages into 5 groups based on morphology, stage transition, and toxicologically important endpoints. The computerized program then reached a substantial agreement of 76.7% (kappa=0.69). The computerized staging tool uses local ternary patterns to describe the texture of the tubules and a support vector machine classifier to learn which textures correspond to which stages. The results have the potential to modernize the tedious staging process required in toxicological evaluation of testicular tissue, especially if combined with whole-slide imaging and automated tubular segmentation.

AB Chemicals emitted into the environment are typically present at low concentrations but may act together in mixtures. Concentration-response curves of in vitro bioassays were often linear for effect levels <30%, and the predictions for concentration addition (CA) of similarly acting chemicals and for independent action (IA) of dissimilarly acting chemicals overlapped. We derived a joint CA/IA mixture model for the low-effect level portion of concentration-response curves. In a first case study, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of over 200 mixtures of up to 17 components that were mixed in concentration ratios as they occurred in river water. The predictions of the full IA model were indistinguishable from the predictions of the full CA model up to 10% effect, confirming the applicability of the joint CA/IA mixture model at low effect levels. In a second case study, we evaluated if environmental concentrations trigger effects at levels low enough for the joint CA/IA mixture model to apply. The detected concentrations were scaled by their toxic potencies to estimate the mixture effect of the detected chemicals in a complex mixture. In 86% of 156 samples the effects fell in the validity range of the joint CA/IA mixture model (<10% effect level), confirming the CA assumption for toxic unit summation. The joint CA/IA mixture model is not suitable for testing specific mixture hypotheses and interactions of chemicals in mixtures, where more refined models are required; but it is helpful for the interpretation of effects of complex (multicomponent) environmental mixtures, especially for water samples with relatively low effect level.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-8.

AB Human-dominated waterways contain thousands of chemicals. Determining which chemical is the most important stressor is important, yet very challenging. The Toxicity Identification Evaluation (TIE) procedure from the US Environmental Protection Agency uses a series of chemical and physical manipulations to fractionate compounds within a matrix and systematically identify potential toxicants through laboratory bioassay testing. Although this may provide useful information, it lacks ecological realism because it is subject to laboratory-related artifacts and is resource intensive. The in situ Toxicity Identification Evaluation (iTIE) technology was developed to improve this approach and has undergone a number of modifications over the past several years. The novel prototype 3 consists of an array of iTIE ambient water fractionation units. Each unit is connected to a peristaltic pumping system with an organism exposure chamber that receives water from a resin chamber to chemically fractionate test site water. Test organisms included freshwater and marine standard toxicity test species. Postfractionation waters are collected for subsequent chemical analyses. Currently, the resins allow for separation of ammonia, metals, and nonpolar organics; the subsequent toxicity responses are compared between treatments and unfractionated, ambient exposures. The iTIE system was deployed to a depth of 3 m and evaluated in streams and marine harbors. Chemical analyses of water and iTIE chemical sorptive resins confirmed chemical groups causing lethal to sublethal responses. The system proved to be as sensitive or more so than the traditional phase 1 TIE test and required almost half of the resources to complete. This iTIE prototype provides a robust technology that improves stressor-causality linkages and thereby supports strong evidence for ecological risk weight-of-evidence assessments.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-9.

AB Fertilizers containing phosphate (PO43-) are commonly used within the agricultural industry and are known to increase the bioavailability and mobility of metalloids like arsenic (As). This may increase plant uptake of As and hence pose a risk to human health. Arsenic and antimony (Sb) often co-occur in contaminated soils; however, little is known about the interactions between As and Sb with PO43- on their bioavailability, accumulation, and toxicity in plants. The present study investigated individual and combined As and Sb-contaminated soils across 2 soil PO43- concentrations using a commonly consumed leafy vegetable, choy sum (Brassica chinensis var. parachinensis). Increased soil PO43- had no clear influence on the bioavailability of As or Sb (derived from a sequential extraction procedure). At high PO43- concentration, B. chinensis accumulated higher amounts of As in the shoots and roots in both individual and co-contaminated soil, whereas Sb accumulation increased only when Sb was the only contaminant. When As was the only contaminant, the translocation of As from roots to shoots decreased as soil PO43- increased. Increased soil PO43- had no influence on Sb translocation from root to shoot. Although As was toxic (impaired growth) at low PO43- soil concentration, no toxicity was observed in the high-PO43- soil. No toxicity was observed for Sb in either low- or high-PO43- soils. Increased soil PO43- concentration ameliorated or masked As toxicity to plant growth and led to higher As concentration in the plant's edible parts. The addition of high soil PO43- concentrations ameliorated or masked As toxicity to plant growth in both individually and As + Sb co-contaminated soil; however, the plant's edible parts accumulated higher As and Sb concentrations.

AB The commercialization of RNA-based agricultural products requires robust ecological risk assessments. Ecological risk is operationally defined as a function of exposure and adverse effects. Information on the environmental fate of RNA-based plant-incorporated protectants is essential to define routes and duration of exposure to potentially sensitive nontarget organisms. Providing these details in problem formulation helps focus the ecological risk assessment on the relevant species of concern. Postharvest plant residue is often considered to be the most significant route of exposure for genetically modified crops to adjacent aquatic environments. Previous studies have shown that DvSnf7 RNA from SmartStax PRO maize dissipates rapidly in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Although these studies suggest that direct exposure to DvSnf7 RNA is likely to be low, little is known regarding the fate of DvSnf7 RNA produced in plants after entering an aquatic environment. This exposure scenario is relevant to detritivorous aquatic invertebrates that process conditioned maize tissues that enter aquatic environments. To assess potential exposure to shredders, dissipation of DvSnf7 RNA expressed maize tissue was evaluated following immersion in microcosms containing sediment and water. Concentrations of DvSnf7 RNA in the tissue were measured over a duration of 21 d. The DvSnf7 RNA dissipated rapidly from immersed maize tissue and was undetectable in the tissues after 3 d. Concentrations of DvSnf7 RNA found in tissue as well as calculated water column concentrations were below levels known to elicit effects in a highly sensitive surrogate species, supporting the conclusion of minimal risk to aquatic nontarget organisms.

We found that Hg concentrations in effluent varied by about a factor of 2 on monthly, weekly, and hourly timescale comparisons. These results suggest that limited sampling can yield a representative concentration with reasonable uncertainty for purposes of estimating the environmental significance of Hg from WWTPs.

AB Dried blood spots (DBS), created by applying and drying a whole blood sample onto filter paper, provide a simple and minimally invasive procedure for collecting, transporting, and storing blood. Because DBS are ideal for use in field and resource-limited settings, we aimed to develop a simple and accurate DBS-based approach for assessing mercury (Hg) exposure and dietary carbon sources for landlocked Arctic char, a sentinel fish species in the Arctic. We collected liquid whole blood (from the caudal vein), muscle, liver, and brains of Arctic char (n = 36) from 8 lakes spanning a Hg gradient in the Canadian High Arctic. We measured total Hg concentrations ([THg]) of field-prepared DBS and Arctic char tissues. Across a considerable range, [THg] of DBS (0.04-3.38 mu g/g wet wt) were highly correlated with [THg] of all tissues (r(2) range = 0.928-0.996). We also analyzed the compound-specific carbon isotope ratios (expressed as delta C-13 values) of essential amino acids (EAAs) isolated from DBS, liquid whole blood, and muscle. The delta C-13 values of 5 EAAs (delta C-13(EAAs); isoleucine [Ile], leucine [Leu], phenylalanine [Phe], valine [Val], and threonine [Thr]) from DBS were highly correlated with delta C-13(EAAs) of liquid whole blood (r(2) range = 0.693-0.895) and muscle (r(2) range = 0.642-0.881). The patterns of delta C-13(EAAs) of landlocked Arctic char were remarkably consistent across sample types and indicate that EAAs are most likely of algal origin. Because a small volume of blood (similar to 50 mu L) dried on filter paper can be used to determine Hg exposure levels of various tissues and to fingerprint carbon sources, DBS sampling may decrease the burdens of research and may be developed as a nonlethal sampling technique.

AB It is often difficult to compare studies examining the effects of endectocides on dung fauna because of different experimental approaches, for example, active ingredients (eprinomectin, doramectin, ivermectin, moxidectin) and formulations (injectable, pour-on, spiked). To gain a better understanding, we performed a quantitative meta-analysis using 22 studies to assess the overall effect of endectocide residues on the occurrence (presence or absence) and abundance of aphodiine dung beetles. Our results document a positive effect on the occurrence of adult beetles, indicating that adults tend to be attracted to dung with residues. Conversely, larvae are less likely to occur in the presence of residues. Thus, either adults that colonize dung with residues do not lay eggs or, more likely, the larvae that hatch from these eggs die early in development. Abundance of adult and larval stages was shown to be significantly reduced in dung containing residues. When individual endectocides were compared, only ivermectin demonstrated a significantly negative effect on the abundance of both adults and larvae, possibly owing to a small sample size for other agents. In laboratory studies, only dung "spiked" with endectocides reduced the abundance of larvae, whereas during field research, only pour-on applications were shown to reduce the abundance of larvae. The present study further documents the nontarget effects of endectocide residues on dung-dwelling organisms, provides robust evidence on the consequences of different application methods, and emphasizes the need for standardized methodological techniques in future studies.

   PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES
AB Ionizable organic chemicals (IOCs) such as organic acids and bases are an important substance class requiring aquatic hazard evaluation. Although the aquatic toxicity of IOCs is highly dependent on the water pH, many toxicity studies in the literature cannot be interpreted because pH was not reported or not kept constant during the experiment, calling for an adaptation and improvement of testing guidelines. The modulating influence of pH on toxicity is mainly caused by pH-dependent uptake and bioaccumulation of IOCs, which can be described by ion-trapping and toxicokinetic models. The internal effect concentrations of IOCs were found to be independent of the external pH because of organisms' and cells' ability to maintain a stable internal pH milieu. If the external pH is close to the internal pH, existing quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for neutral organics can be adapted by substituting the octanol-water partition coefficient by the ionization-corrected liposome-water distribution ratio as the hydrophobicity descriptor, demonstrated by modification of the target lipid model. Charged, zwitterionic and neutral species of an IOC can all contribute to observed toxicity, either through concentration-additive mixture effects or by interaction of different species, as is the case for uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration. For specifically acting IOCs, we recommend a 2-step screening procedure with ion-trapping/QSAR models used to predict the baseline toxicity, followed by adjustment using the toxic ratio derived from in vitro systems. Receptor- or plasma-binding models also show promise for elucidating IOC toxicity. The present review is intended to help demystify the ecotoxicity of IOCs and provide recommendations for their hazard and risk assessment. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;39:269-286. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB A seminal question in ecotoxicology is the extent to which contaminant exposure evokes prolonged effects on physiological function and fitness. A series of studies were undertaken with American kestrels ingesting environmentally realistic concentrations of the second-generation anticoagulant rodenticide (SGAR) brodifacoum. Kestrels fed brodifacoum at 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mu g/g diet wet weight for 7 d exhibited dose-dependent hemorrhage, histopathological lesions, and coagulopathy (prolonged prothrombin and Russell's viper venom times). Following termination of a 7-d exposure to 0.5 mu g brodifacoum/g diet, prolonged blood clotting time returned to baseline values within 1 wk, but brodifacoum residues in liver and kidney persisted during the 28-d recovery period (terminal half-life estimates >50 d). To examine the hazard of sequential anticoagulant rodenticide (AR) exposure, kestrels were exposed to either the first-generation AR chlorophacinone (1.5 mu g/g diet) or the SGAR brodifacoum (0.5 mu g/g diet) for 7 d and, following a recovery period, challenged with a low dose of chlorophacinone (0.75 mu g/g diet) for 7 d. In brodifacoum-exposed kestrels, the challenge exposure clearly prolonged prothrombin time compared to naive controls and kestrels previously exposed to chlorophacinone. These data provide evidence that the SGAR brodifacoum may have prolonged effects that increase the toxicity of subsequent AR exposure. Because free-ranging predatory and scavenging wildlife are often repeatedly exposed to ARs, such protracted toxicological effects need to be considered in hazard and risk assessments.

AB Regulatory jurisdictions worldwide are increasingly incorporating bioavailability-based toxicity models into development of protective values (PVALs) for freshwater and saltwater aquatic life (e.g., water quality criteria, standards, and/or guidelines) for metals. Use of such models for regulatory purposes should be contingent on their ability to meet performance criteria as specified through a model-validation process. Model validation generally involves an assessment of a model's appropriateness, relevance, and accuracy. We review existing guidance for validation of bioavailability-based toxicity models, recommend questions that should be addressed in model-validation studies, discuss model study type and design considerations, present several new ways to evaluate model performance in validation studies, and suggest a framework for use of model validation in PVAL development. We conclude that model validation should be rigorous but flexible enough to fit the user's purpose. Although a model can never be fully validated to a level of zero uncertainty, it can be sufficiently validated to fit a specific purpose. Therefore, support (or lack of support) for a model should be presented in such a way that users can choose their own level of acceptability. We recommend that models be validated using experimental designs and endpoints consistent with the data sets that were used to parameterize and calibrate the model and validated across a broad range of geographically and ecologically relevant water types.

AB The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guideline 305 for bioaccumulation testing in fish includes the option to conduct a dietary test for assessing a chemical's bioaccumulation behavior. However, the one-compartment toxicokinetic model that is used in the guidelines to analyze the results from dietary bioaccumulation tests is not consistent with the current state of the science, experimental practices, and information needs for bioaccumulation and risk assessment. The present study presents 1) a 2-compartment toxicokinetic modeling framework for describing the bioaccumulation of neutral hydrophobic organic chemicals in fish and 2) an associated toxicokinetic analysis tool (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion [ADME] B calculator) for the analysis and interpretation of dietary bioaccumulation test data from OECD-305 dietary tests. The model framework and ADME-B calculator are illustrated by analysis of fish dietary bioaccumulation test data for 238 substances representing different structural classes and susceptibilities to biotransformation. The ADME of the chemicals is determined from dietary bioaccumulation tests and bioconcentration factors, biomagnification factors, and somatic and intestinal biotransformation rates. The 2-compartment fish toxicokinetic model can account for the effect of the exposure pathway on bioaccumulation, which the one-compartment model cannot. This insight is important for applying a weight-of-evidence approach to bioaccumulation assessment where information from aqueous and dietary test endpoints can be integrated to improve the evaluation of a chemical's bioaccumulation potential.

AB High levels of organochlorine contaminants (OCs) have been found in arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) from Lake Ellasjoen, Bjornoya (Norwegian Arctic). The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential genotoxic effect of environmental organochlorine contaminant exposure in arctic char from Ellasjoen compared with arctic char from the low-contaminated Lake Laksvatn nearby. Blood was analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis and image data analysis to quantify the fraction of total DNA that migrated into the gel (DNA-FTM) as a relative measure of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Analysis by GC-MS of muscle samples showed an average 43 times higher concentration of sigma OCs in arctic char from Ellasjoen (n = 18) compared with Laksvatn char (n = 21). Char from Lake Ellasjoen had a much higher frequency of DSBs, as measured by DNA-FTM, than char from Lake Laksvatn. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regressions show that there was a significant positive relationship between DSBs and levels of organochlorine contaminants in the char. In addition, DSBs were less frequent in reproductively mature char than in immature char. The results suggest that organochlorine contaminants are genotoxic to arctic char.

AB Silver (Ag) salts have been shown to be highly toxic to freshwater organisms. There is nevertheless still a high level of uncertainty as to the aquatic effects of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs), and how these relate to the effects of soluble Ag salts. As part of the substance evaluation for Ag of the European Union Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals regulation, we have generated new data to justify read-across from soluble Ag salts to AgNPs. The aquatic toxicity to algae growth and Daphnia magna reproduction, fate, and behavior of AgNO3 versus AgNPs were tested and compared. Chloride salts in the test media were replaced with equimolar concentrations of nitrate salts. Total Ag, "conventionally" dissolved Ag (0.45 mu m), and "truly" dissolved Ag (3 kDa) were determined. Algae were the most sensitive test species to AgNO3 (10% effect concentration [EC10] 0.10 mu g Ag/L) when expressed as conventionally dissolved Ag. The corresponding value for AgNPs was 0.26 mu g/L. For D. magna reproduction, the lowest EC10 values were 3.49 mu g Ag/L for AgNO3 and 33.4 mu g Ag/L for AgNPs. Using measured Ag concentrations, AgNO3 was experimentally shown to be more toxic than AgNPs for all Ag fractions. We explain these observations by a different dissolution behavior of AgNO3 versus AgNPs. The results provide experimental confirmation that AgNO3 can be used as a conservative estimate for the aquatic effects of AgNPs at comparable Ag concentrations.

AB Metals present in concentrates are in a solid form and are not bioavailable, but they can dissolve or potentially transform to more soluble forms. Transformation/dissolution laboratory protocols have been developed to assess the importance of dissolution of sparingly soluble metal substances in the context of hazard classification; however, these tests represent worst-case scenarios for metal bioavailability because attenuation mechanisms such as complexation, sorption, and transport to the sediment are not considered. A unit world model (UWM) for metals in lakes, tableau input coupled kinetics equilibrium transport (TICKET)-UWM, has been developed that considers key processes affecting metal transport, fate, and toxicity including complexation by aqueous inorganic and ligands, partitioning to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC), precipitation, and transport of dissolved metals and solids between the water column and sediment. The TICKET-UWM model was used to assess the fate of a metal concentrate and dissolved metal ions released from the concentrate following an instantaneous input to a generalized lake. Concentrate dissolution rates in the water column were parameterized using results from batch transformation/dissolution tests for 2 specific concentrates containing lead (Pb), copper (Cu), and cobalt (Co). The TICKET-UWM results for a generalized lake environment showed that water column concentrations of metals in the lake environment after 28 d were several orders of magnitude lower than the 28-d concentration from the transformation/dissolution tests because Pb, Cu, and Co partitioned to POC in the water column and were subsequently removed due to settling. Resuspension of sediment served to increase total metal in the water column, but the resulting concentrations were still much lower than the 28-d concentrations from the transformation/dissolution tests. Information from TICKET-UWM could be used to refine the environmental hazard profiles of metals. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1256-1272. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB The insect yolk precursor vitellogenin is a lipoglycoprotein synthesized and stored in the fat body and secreted into the hemolymph. In honey bees, vitellogenin displays crucial functions in hormone signaling, behavioral transition of nurse bees to foragers, stress resistance, and longevity in workers. Plant protection products such as neonicotinoids, pyrethroids, and organophosphates alter the transcriptional expression of vitellogenin. To assess plant protection product-induced alterations on the protein level, we developed a rabbit polyclonal vitellogenin antibody. After characterization, we assessed its specificity and vitellogenin levels in different tissues of worker bees. The vitellogenin antibody recognized full-length 180-kDa vitellogenin and the lighter fragment of 150 kDa in fat body, hemolymph, and brain. In hemolymph, a band of approximately 75 kDa was detected. Subsequent mass spectrometric analysis (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) confirmed the 180- and 150-kDa bands as vitellogenin. Subsequently, we evaluated vitellogenin expression in brain, fat body, and hemolymph on 24-h exposure of bees to 3 ng/bee to the neonicotinoid clothianidin. Full-length vitellogenin was upregulated 3-fold in the fat body, and the 150-kDa fragment was upregulated in the brain of exposed honey bees, whereas no alteration occurred in the hemolymph. Upregulation of the vitellogenin protein by the neonicotinoid clothianidin is in line with the previously shown induction of its transcript. We conclude that vitellogenin might serve as a potential biomarker for neonicotinoid and other pesticide exposure in bees. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-10. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) modeling enables researchers to predict internal tissue concentrations for various species exposed to exogenous compounds through different routes at varying concentrations without having to run in vivo experiments for each scenario. Parameters for the models may be gathered from in vivo or in vitro measurements, cross-species or cross-chemical extrapolations, literature reviews, or other models. The PBTK models, described using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), are then simulated using these parameters for a given compound/exposure/species scenario. Although they are potentially useful for regulatory toxicology, the complexity of ODE programming and simulation remains a barrier for many would-be researchers. Petri nets, a graphical modeling framework, offers a more intuitive approach to PBTK modeling. To demonstrate their utility and ease of use, we present a model of waterborne fluoranthene exposure to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) written and simulated in Snoopy, a graphical Petri net development and simulation software package. We converted an existing ODE PBTK model and evaluated the Petri net model against the ODE model results. The simulated tissue concentrations of the Petri net model closely mirrored the simulated concentrations of the ODE model. To convert the ODE model to a Petri net model, we introduced a new parameter, blood volume (V-BLOOD). Sensitivity analysis found V-BLOOD to be very robust when varied over an order of magnitude. The resulting Petri net PBTK model has a number of advantages over ODE models, while maintaining equivalent predictive functionality. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-10. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB The antidepressant amitriptyline is a widely used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that is found in the aquatic environment. The present study investigates alterations in the brain and the liver metabolome of gilt-head bream (Sparus aurata) after exposure at an environmentally relevant concentration (0.2 mu g/L) of amitriptyline for 7 d. Analysis of variance-simultaneous component analysis is used to identify metabolites that distinguish exposed from control animals. Overall, alterations in lipid metabolism suggest the occurrence of oxidative stress in both the brain and the liver-a common adverse effect of xenobiotics. However, alterations in the amino acid arginine are also observed. These are likely related to the nitric oxide system that is known to be associated with the mechanism of action of antidepressants. In addition, changes in asparagine and methionine levels in the brain and pantothenate, uric acid, and formylisoglutamine/N-formimino-L-glutamate levels in the liver could indicate variation of amino acid metabolism in both tissues; and the perturbation of glutamate in the liver implies that the energy metabolism is also affected. These results reveal that environmentally relevant concentrations of amitriptyline perturb a fraction of the metabolome that is not typically associated with antidepressant exposure in fish.

AB The San Francisco Bay delta (USA) is experiencing seasonally warmer waters attributable to climate change and receives rainstorm runoff containing pyrethroid pesticides. Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) inhabit the affected waterways from hatch through smoltification, and thus juvenile fish may experience both pyrethroid and warmer water exposures. The effects of higher temperatures and pesticide exposure on presmolt Chinook are unknown. To improve understanding of the potential interaction between temperature and pesticide exposure on salmonid development, juvenile alevin and fry were reared in 11, 16.4, and 19 degrees C freshwater for 11 d and 2 wk, respectively, and exposed to nominal concentrations of 0, 0.15, and 1.5 mu g/L bifenthrin for the final 96 h of rearing. Estradiol-17 beta (E2), testosterone, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine levels were measured in whole-body homogenates using hormone-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH2), dopamine receptor 2A, and growth hormone 1 (GH1) mRNA levels were measured using quantitative PCR. Results showed significantly decreased survival and condition factors observed with increasing temperature in alevin. Alevin thyroid hormones increased significantly with temperature, but fry thyroid hormones trended toward a decrease at lower temperatures with increasing bifenthrin exposure. There were significant reductions in fry testosterone and E2 at 11 degrees C with increasing bifenthrin treatments and significant changes in GnRH2 and GH1 gene expression in both alevin and fry, indicating potential disruption of hormonal and signaling pathways.

AB Microplastics have been detected in freshwaters all over the world in almost all samples, and ecotoxicological studies have shown adverse effects of microplastics on organisms. However, no risk assessment of microplastics has been performed specifically in freshwater so far. The aim of the present study was therefore to review all exposure and ecotoxicity data available for microplastics in freshwaters and to perform a preliminary probabilistic risk assessment. The exposure probability distribution was based on 391 concentrations measured in Asia, Europe, and North America. Because exposure data are mainly available in particle number-based metrics but results from hazard studies are mostly mass-based, the hazard results were converted into particle number concentrations. A statistical analysis of the hazard data showed that there was no significant influence of particle shape or type of polymer on the no-observed-effect concentration. The predicted-no-effect concentration (PNEC) was calculated as the fifth percentile of the probabilistic species sensitivity distribution, based on 53 values from 14 freshwater species, to have a mode of 7.4 x 10(5) particles center dot m(-3) (25th and 75th quantiles of 6.1 x 10(5) and 1.3 x 10(6) particles center dot m(-3), respectively). The exposure probability distribution was divided by the PNEC probability distribution to calculate risk characterization ratios (RCRs), with modes of 1.3 x 10(-6) in North America, 3.3 x 10(-6) in Europe, and 4.6 x 10(-3) in Asia. Probability distributions associated with the RCRs showed that ecological risks cannot be entirely excluded in Asia, where 0.4% of the RCR values were above 1. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:436-447.

AB We assessed the relationship between the diffusive gradient in thin film (DGT) technique using the new ion-exchange resin Ambersep GT74 and the uptake of mercury (Hg) by a model plant cultivated on metal-contaminated agricultural soils under greenhouse conditions. Based on the total Hg content, 0.37 to 1.17% of the Hg passed to the soil porewater from the solid phase, and 2.18 to 9.18% of the Hg is DGT-available. These results were confirmed by calculating the R value (the ratio of the concentrations of bioavailable Hg measured by DGT and soil solution), which illustrated the strong bonding of Hg to the solid phase of soil and its extremely low mobility. Only inorganic Hg2+ species were found in the metal-contaminated agricultural soils, as determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography-cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry speciation analysis. The Hg was distributed in Miscanthus x giganteus organs in the following order for all sampling sites: roots (55-82%) >> leaves (8-27%) > stems (7-16%) > rhizomes (4-7%).

AB Over the past few years, the fish embryo test (FET) has become widely accepted as an animal-friendly protocol for ecotoxicological research. As Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 236, the FET has been widely applied for simple mixture exposures under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals regulation of the European Union; and now its use is spreading worldwide as a supposedly reliable whole-effluent test (i.e., the testing of complex mixture exposures). However, comparative peer-reviewed data regarding the FET's efficiency for whole-effluent tests are virtually nonexistent. The primary objective of the present study was to make the first comparative test between the FET according to OECD 236 and other standard and slightly modified standard fish protocols used worldwide for whole-effluent tests. For that, we used an untreated hospital effluent considered to be highly toxic but disposed of in municipal sewerage. The base methods were OECD 203 (juvenile), US Environmental Protection Agency method 2000.0 (larvae), and OECD 236 (embryo). We also evaluated the addition of 3 virtually costless sublethal metrics (immobility, nonhatching, and pericardial edema) that could enhance the sensitivity of OECD 236. We observed acute toxicity in all 8 methodologies tested, with a clear escalation in sensitivity (larvae>juvenileembryo). Larvae were the most sensitive life stage for whole-effluent tests. The addition of sublethal metrics to OECD 236 enhanced its previous sensitivity in over 30%. Thus we conclude that OECD 236 acts below its potential and that the embryonic stage (as used in the FET) may not be the most sensitive life stage for whole-effluent tests.

AB The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals have been established to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. Delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals will require a healthy and productive environment. An understanding of the impacts of chemicals which can negatively impact environmental health is therefore essential to the delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, current research on and regulation of chemicals in the environment tend to take a simplistic view and do not account for the complexity of the real world, which inhibits the way we manage chemicals. There is therefore an urgent need for a step change in the way we study and communicate the impacts and control of chemicals in the natural environment. To do this requires the major research questions to be identified so that resources are focused on questions that really matter. We present the findings of a horizon-scanning exercise to identify research priorities of the European environmental science community around chemicals in the environment. Using the key questions approach, we identified 22 questions of priority. These questions covered overarching questions about which chemicals we should be most concerned about and where, impacts of global megatrends, protection goals, and sustainability of chemicals; the development and parameterization of assessment and management frameworks; and mechanisms to maximize the impact of the research. The research questions identified provide a first-step in the path forward for the research, regulatory, and business communities to better assess and manage chemicals in the natural environment.

AB Birds are receptors of concern for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), yet limited data describing the relative potency of PAH congeners are available for avian species. In the present study, we determined embryonic median lethal dose (LD50) values for 5 PAH congeners in chicken (Gallus gallus) and one PAH congener in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). Graded concentrations of each test compound were injected into the air cell of chicken or quail eggs before incubation. Embryos were monitored through development (quail) or hatching (chicken). All PAHs tested caused dose-dependent increases in embryo mortality, but few other effects (e.g., weight changes, deformities) were observed. In chicken, windows of developmental sensitivity were identified between embryonic days 4 and 9 and between embryonic days 20 and 22. The rank order potency of benzo[k]fluoranthene (BkF; 76g/kg) approximate to dibenz[ah]anthracene (83g/kg) > indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (325g/kg) > benzo[a]pyrene (461g/kg) > benz[a]anthracene (529g/kg) corresponded well with previous in vitro estimates in birds. Previously published ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase median effect concentrations from cultured chicken embryo hepatocytes were highly predictive of our LD50s (p < 0.001, r(2)=0.99). To explore differences in sensitivity between species, Japanese quail eggs were injected with BkF, the most potent PAH. We found that chicken and quail were nearly equally sensitive to BkF. The present results contribute to our developing understanding of variability in responses to PAHs among congeners and species. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:1556-1564. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB To support the goals articulated in the vision for exposure and risk assessment in the twenty-first century, we highlight the application of a thermodynamic chemical activity approach for the exposure and risk assessment of chemicals in the environment. The present article describes the chemical activity approach, its strengths and limitations, and provides examples of how this concept may be applied to the management of single chemicals and chemical mixtures. The examples demonstrate that the chemical activity approach provides a useful framework for 1) compiling and evaluating exposure and toxicity information obtained from many different sources, 2) expressing the toxicity of single and multiple chemicals, 3) conducting hazard and risk assessments of single and multiple chemicals, 4) identifying environmental exposure pathways, and 5) reducing error and characterizing uncertainty in risk assessment. The article further illustrates that the chemical activity approach can support an adaptive management strategy for environmental stewardship of chemicals where safe chemical activities are established based on toxicological studies and presented as guidelines for environmental quality in various environmental media that can be monitored by passive sampling and other techniques.

AB The US Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) current ambient water quality criteria (AWQC) for lead (Pb) in freshwater were developed in 1984. The criteria are adjusted for hardness, but more recent studies have demonstrated that other parameters, especially dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and pH, have a much stronger influence on Pb bioavailability. These recent studies have been used to support development of a biotic ligand model (BLM) for Pb in freshwater, such that acute and chronic Pb toxicity can be predicted over a wide range of water chemistry conditions. Following USEPA guidelines for AWQC development and using a methodology consistent with that used by the USEPA in developing its recommended BLM-based criteria for copper in 2007, we propose acute and chronic BLM-based AWQC for Pb in freshwater. In addition to the application of the BLM approach that can better account for site-specific Pb bioavailability, the toxicity data sets presented are much more robust than in 1984, and there are now sufficient chronic Pb toxicity data available that use of an acute-to-chronic ratio is no longer necessary. Over a range of North American surface waters with representative water chemistry conditions, proposed acute BLM-based Pb criteria ranged from approximately 20 to 1000g/L and chronic BLM-based Pb criteria ranged from approximately 0.3 to 40g/L. The lowest criteria were for water with low DOC (1.2mg/L), pH (6.7), and hardness (4.3mg/L as CaCO3), whereas the highest criteria were for water with high DOC (9.8mg/L), pH (8.2), and hardness (288mg/L as CaCO3).

AB The 2 most abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) measured in Deepwater Horizon crude oil, naphthalene and phenanthrene, and their associated homologs have both been shown to be acutely toxic in fish. Although fish have a relatively high metabolic capacity for PAHs, hydroxylated PAH (OH-PAH) derivatives formed during the initial metabolic response can negatively impact the health of fish. Species-specific metabolism of naphthalene and phenanthrene was evaluated in 3 marine teleosts, red drum (Scianops ocellatus), Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus), and southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma). Fish were exposed to Deepwater Horizon crude oil by intraperitoneal injections at time 0 and 48h, with bile sampling events at 24 and 72h post injection. The data suggested metabolic induction in Florida pompano and red drum, whereas southern flounder may have demonstrated metabolic fatigue. By 24h post injection, overall profiles of red drum and southern flounder were dominated by hydroxylated phenanthrene metabolites; conversely, the Florida pompano profiles were dominated by monohydroxylated naphthalenes. In addition, Florida pompano had faster overall relative biotransformation rates, suggesting their potential decreased susceptibility to adverse effects. Red drum and southern flounder had much lower relative biotransformation rates, indicating their probable susceptibility to adverse outcomes after naphthalene and phenanthrene exposures. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate monohydroxylated PAHs in fish exposed to Deepwater Horizon oil. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3168-3176. (c) 2017 (c) 2017 The Authors.

AB The environmental effects of safeners, agrochemicals that protect crops from herbicide toxicity, are largely unknown, perhaps because they are classified as inert ingredients. We assessed the toxicity to larvae of Chironomus riparius of 1) the dichloroacetamide safener benoxacor; 2) its degradation product, monochloro-benoxacor; 3) the herbicide with which benoxacor is paired, S-metolachlor; and 4) a mixture of S-metolachlor+benoxacor. Under iron-reducing conditions, benoxacor can undergo reductive dechlorination, producing monochloro-benoxacor. To simulate iron-reducing conditions, we prepared benthic microcosms containing an iron-rich siltclay sediment amended with cellulose. Larval C. riparius were exposed to single chemicals via spiked sediment at nominal concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg. Concentrations of a 1:1 mixture of safener and herbicide ranged from 0.02 to 200 mg/kg. Kinetic modeling of microcosm aqueous-phase concentrations indicated that benoxacor transformed with a half-life of 12 d. Cox proportional hazard models of time to emergence during 28-d experiments showed that females had a lowest-observed-effect concentration (LOEC) for benoxacor at 1 mg/kg, whereas their LOEC for monochloro-benoxacor was 0.1 mg/kg. For males, the LOEC for all treatments was 100 mg/kg (200 mg/kg for the mixture). Synergistic effects of the mixture were observed only in females, with a LOEC of 0.2 mg/kg. These results suggest that benoxacor presents a low toxicity risk to C. riparius in environmental systems; however, the possibility of synergistic effects between benoxacor and S-metolachlor merits further investigation.

AB A lotic mesocosm study was carried out in 20-m-long channels, under continuous, environmentally realistic concentrations of copper (Cu) in low, medium, and high exposures (nominally 0, 5, 25, and 75 mu gL(-1); average effective concentrations <0.5, 4, 20, and 57 mu gL(-1) respectively) for 18 mo. Total abundance, taxa richness, and community structure of zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and emerging insects were severely affected at Cu treatment levels of 25 and 75 mu gL(-1). Some taxa were sensitive to Cu, including gastropods such as Lymnaea spp. and Physa sp., crustaceans such as Chydorus sphaericus, Gammarus pulex, and Asellus aquaticus, rotifers such as Mytilina sp. and Trichocerca sp., leeches such as Erpobdella sp., and the emergence of dipteran insects such as Chironomini. Other taxa appeared to be tolerant or favored by indirect effects, as in Chironimidae larvae, the emergence of Orthocladiinae, and the zooplankter Vorticella sp., which increased in the 25 and 75 mu gL(-1) treatments. After approximately 8 mo of Cu exposure, the macroinvertebrate community in the high treatment was decimated to the point that few organisms could be detected, with moderate effects in the medium treatment, and very slight effects in the low-Cu treatment. Subsequently, most taxa in the high-Cu exposure began a gradual and partial recovery. By the end of the study at 18 mo, macroinvertebrate taxa richness was similar to control richness, although overall abundances remained lower than controls. After 18 mo of copper exposure, a no-observed-effect concentration at the community level for consumers was set at 5 mu gL(-1) (4 mu gL(-1) as average effective concentration), and a lowest-observed-effect concentration at 25 mu gL(-1)(20 mu gL(-1) as average effective concentration).

AB The effects of environmental contaminants on arthropod embryo stages have been poorly investigated in ecotoxicology. Moreover, many of these tests used hatching success as the sole metric, although it is possible to detect many more subtle effects. After a detailed description of embryogenesis in Gammarus fossarum, the present study reports on the sublethal effects of cadmium (Cd) exposure during embryonic development in G. fossarum. Embryos were first directly exposed in multiwell plates throughout the entire embryonic cycle (23 d) to increasing Cd concentrations (0, 1.5, and 3.0 mu g/L; 120 embryos/concentration). Then, to assess the representativeness of the gammarid embryo assay performed in multiwell plates, embryos were exposed to similar Cd concentrations through the maternal open brood pouch. Next, to pinpoint sensitive periods of development, embryos were directly exposed to 3.0 mu g/L of Cd for shorter periods of time: during gastrulation, organogenesis, and hatching. After hatching, the following parameters were measured in the newborn individuals: 1) body mass; 2) activity of the enzyme phenoloxidase, a key enzyme of the arthropod immune system; and 3) locomotor activity. Phenoloxidase activity was strongly inhibited in newborn individuals of embryos exposed (either in multiwell plates or in the maternal brood pouch) to 3.0 mu g/L Cd throughout embryonic development. Furthermore, strong detrimental locomotor effects were observed in newborn individuals of embryos directly exposed to 3.0 mu g/L. Exposures for shorter periods of time were not sufficient to induce such effects; no sensitive period could be determined. By bringing new insights into a critical time window of exposure, the gammarid embryo assay could provide a novel and interesting addition to existing bioassays in gammarids. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB The biodegradation of 2 common fluorotelomer surfactants used in aqueous film forming foams (AFFFs), 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide alkylamine (FTAA) and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide alkylbetaine (FTAB), was investigated over 109 d with aerobic wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP) sludge. Results show that biodegradation of 6:2 FTAA and 6:2 FTAB produces 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH), 6:2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (FTCA), 6:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid (FTUCA), 5:3 FTCA, and short-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs). Additional degradation products included 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide (FTSAm), which was a major degradation product in the presence of either active or sterilized sludge, whereas 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (FTSA) production was measured with sterilized sludge only. Six additional degradation products were tentatively identified by quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (qTOF-MS) and attributed to N-dealkylation and oxidation of 6:2 FTAA. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB The American mink is an invasive species in Sweden, and it is legally hunted all year. Therefore, the mink is well suited as a sentinel species for environmental monitoring. In the present study female mink (n = 91) from 6 different areas in Sweden were analyzed for the concentrations of silver, cadmium, mercury and lead in liver tissue using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The wet concentrations in liver tissue were 42.6 +/- 52.7 ng/g for silver, 99.5 +/- 100 ng/g for cadmium, 652 +/- 537 ng/g formercury, and 196 +/- 401 ng/g for lead (expressed as mean + standard deviation). There were associations between the sample area and the concentrations of silver, lead, and mercury. The concentrations of lead and cadmium varied with season of capture and lead, cadmium, and mercury were positively associated with increasing age. Relative liver weight was positively associated with concentrations of mercury and negatively associated with lead and cadmium. Relative kidney weight was negatively associated with lead concentrations. In summary, it is of importance to take age and season of capture into account when assessing levels of heavy metals in wild mink. Also, liver and kidneys seem to be potential targets for heavy metal toxicity in wild female mink in Sweden. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB The synaptic adhesion protein Neurexin 2a (Nrxn2a) plays a key role in neuronal development and is associated with cognitive functioning and locomotor behavior. Although low-level metal exposure poses a potential risk to the human nervous system, especially during the developmental stages, little is known about the effects of metal exposures on nrxn2a expression during embryonic development. We therefore exposed wild-type zebrafish embryos/larvae to cadmium (CdCl2), manganese (MnCl2), and lead ([CH3COO](2)Pb), to determine their effect on mortality, malformation, and hatching rate. Concentrations of these metals in zebrafish were detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis. Locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae was analyzed using a video-track tracking system. Expression of nrxn2a was assessed by in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that mortality, malformation, and bioaccumulation increased as the exposure dosages and duration increased. Developmental exposure to these metals significantly reduced larval swim distance and velocity. The nrxn2aa and nrxn2ab genes were expressed in the central nervous system and downregulated by almost all of the 3 metals, especially Pb. These data demonstrate that exposure to metals downregulates nrxn2a in the zebrafish model system, and this is likely linked to concurrent developmental processes.

AB The present study aimed to assess the bioavailability and toxicity of lead nitrate and lead chloride to Enchytraeus crypticus in a natural standard soil. Worms were exposed to Pb-spiked soil for 21 d, and survival and reproduction were related to total, 0.01 M CaCl2-extractable, and porewater Pb concentrations in the soil and internal concentrations in the surviving animals. The Pb availability for Pb(NO3)(2) and PbCl2 was similar, as confirmed by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The Pb concentrations in surviving worms increased with increasing Pb concentrations in the soil and did not differ for the 2 Pb salts. Lead was toxic to E. crypticus at median lethal concentrations (LC50s) of 543 and 779 mg Pb/kg dry soil and median effect concentrations (EC50s) of 189 and 134 mg Pb/kg dry soil, for Pb(NO3)(2) and PbCl2, respectively. Mortality of E. crypticus was related to internal Pb concentrations in the worms rather than to total or available Pb concentrations in the soil, whereas reproduction toxicity was better explained from Pb concentrations in 0.01 M CaCl2 extracts or porewater of the test soil than from total Pb concentrations in the soil or Pb concentrations in the worms. Overall, the bioavailability and toxicity of Pb(NO3)(2) and PbCl2 to E. crypticus in LUFA 2.2 soil did not differ. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Investigations into the environmental fate and effects of microplastics have been gaining momentum. Small, insoluble polymeric particles are implicated by scientists in a wide variety of studies that are used to suggest a potential for widespread impacts in freshwater and marine pelagic and sediment environments. An exponential growth in scientific publications and an increase in regulatory attention have occurred. However, despite these efforts, the environmental hazard of these particles is still unknown. To evaluate the hazard of microplastics within a risk assessment context, we need a way to evaluate the quality of experimental studies. We performed a thorough review of the quality and focus of environmental microplastic research, to understand the methodologies employed and how this may assist or distract from the ability of environmental risk assessors to evaluate microplastics. We provide guidance to improve the reliability and relevance of ecotoxicological studies for regulatory and broader environmental assessments. Nine areas of needed improvement are identified and discussed. Important data gaps and experimental limitations are highlighted. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from creosote exposure in the laboratory resulted in deleterious effects in developing Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) embryos, and potentially toxic concentrations of PAHs were measured using passive water samplers at 1 of 3 harbor field sites in Juneau, Alaska, USA. Aqueous total PAH concentrations of 4.6 mu g/L and 8.4 mu g/L from creosote exposure resulted in skeletal defects and ineffective swimming in hatched larvae in the laboratory (10% effective concentrations) and were the most sensitive parameters measured. Hatch rates also suffered from creosote exposure in a dose-dependent manner: at exposures between 5 mu g/L and 50 mu g/L total PAH, 50% of the population failed to hatch. Comparisons between laboratory and field deployed passive samplers suggested that for at least 1 harbor in Juneau, concentrations sufficient to induce teratogenic effects were found directly on creosoted pilings, within 10 cm of them, and sometimes at a distance of 10 m. Total PAH concentrations generally decreased with distance from creosoted pilings. Creosote pilings contribute to the PAH load within a marina and can rise to PAH concentrations that are harmful to fish embryos, but at a scale that is localized in the environment. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Methylmercury (MeHg) is known to biomagnify in marine food chains, resulting in higher concentrations in upper trophic level animals than their prey. To better understand how marine copepods, an important intermediate between phytoplankton and forage fish at the bottom of the food chain, assimilate and release MeHg, the authors performed a series of laboratory experiments using the gamma-emitting radiotracer Hg-203(2+) and (MeHg)-Hg-203 with the calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa. Assimilation efficiencies of Hg2+ and MeHg ranged from 25% to 31% and 58% to 79%, respectively, depending on algal diets. Assimilation efficiencies were positively related to the fraction of Hg in the cytoplasm of the algal cells that comprised their diet. Efflux rates of Hg2_ (0.29/d) and MeHg (0.21/d) following aqueous uptake were similar, but efflux rates following dietary uptake were significantly lower for MeHg (0.11-0.22/d) than Hg2+(0.47-0.66/d). The calculated trophic transfer factors in copepods were > 1 for MeHg and consistently low (similar to 0.2) for Hg2+. The authors used the parameters measured to quantitatively model the relative importance of MeHg sources (water or diet) for copepods and to predict the overall MeHg concentrations in copepods in different marine environments. In general, MeHg uptake from the diet accounted for most of the body burden in copepods (> 50%). For an algal diet with a MeHg dry weight bioconcentration factor similar to 106, > 90% of a copepod's MeHg body burden can be shown to derive from the diet. The model-predicted MeHg concentrations in the copepods were comparable to independent measurements for copepods in coastal and open-ocean regions, implying that the measured parameters and model are applicable to natural waters.

AB The combined toxicities of binary mixtures of veterinary pharmaceutical active compounds were examined using the bioluminescent bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri as a test organism (Microtox (R) test). Mixtures were prepared at an equitoxic ratio that corresponded to the inhibitory concentration, 10% (IC10) of individual pharmaceutical active compounds. In addition, the toxicity was determined of a multicomponent mixture that contained all of the investigated pharmaceutical active compounds mixed at a ratio corresponding to their individual predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) values. The experimental results were successively compared with those obtained by applying the 2 most widely used models for predicting mixture toxicity, the concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) models. Although the toxicity of the multicomponent mixture tested was well predicted by the CA and IA models, deviations from the model predictions were found for almost all of the binary mixtures. The deviations from the CA and IA models were greater at lower concentrations, particularly when diclofenac sodium and amoxicillin were present in the mixture. Based on these results, another hypothesis was tested, that of toxicological interactions occurring in binary mixtures (in the direction of synergistic or antagonistic effects), by applying the combination index method, which allowed for computerized quantification of synergism, the additive effect and antagonism. The application of this method confirmed, for at least half of the binary combinations, the clear presence of synergistic deviations at the lowest tested concentrations, with a tendency toward antagonism at the higher ones. In 1 case, a relevant antagonistic interaction was observed. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Diluted bitumen (dilbit; the product of oil sands extraction) is transported through freshwater ecosystems critical to Pacific salmon. This is concerning, because crude oil disrupts cardiac development, morphology, and function in embryonic fish, and cardiac impairment in salmon can have major consequences on migratory success and fitness. The sensitivity of early life-stage salmon to dilbit and its specific cardiotoxic effects are unknown. Sockeye salmon parr were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of the water-soluble fraction (WSF) of dilbit for 1wk and 4wk, followed by an examination of molecular, morphological, and organismal endpoints related to cardiotoxicity. We show that parr are sensitive to WSF of dilbit, with total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations of 3.5 mu g/L sufficient to induce a liver biomarker of PAH exposure, and total PAH of 16.4 mu g/L and 66.7 mu g/L inducing PAH biomarkers in the heart. Furthermore, WSF of dilbit induces concentration-dependent cardiac remodeling coincident with performance effects: fish exposed to 66.7 mu g/L total PAH have relatively fewer myocytes and more collagen in the compact myocardium and impaired swimming performance at 4wk, whereas the opposite changes occur in fish exposed to 3.5 mu g/L total PAH. The results demonstrate cardiac sensitivity to dilbit exposure that could directly impact sockeye migratory success. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:354-360. (c) 2016 SETAC

AB Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a member of the anthropogenic class of perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAAs) and one of the most frequently detected PFAAs in water, humans, mammals, and fish around the world. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a small freshwater fish considered an appropriate vertebrate model for investigating the toxicity of compounds. Previous investigations showed tissue-specific bioaccumulation and alterations in the expression of fatty acid-binding proteins (fabps) in male and female zebrafish, potentially due to interactions between PFAA and fatty acid transporters. In addition, a number of neurological impacts have been reported as a result of human and animal exposure to PFAAs. Therefore, the present comprehensive study was designed to investigate whether PFOS exposure affects the expression of genes associated with fatty acid metabolism (fabp1a, fabp2, and fabp10a) in zebrafish liver, intestine, heart, and ovary and genes involved in the nervous system (acetylcholinesterase, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, choline acetyltransferase, histone deacetylase 6, and nerve growth factor) in brain and muscle. The results indicate alterations in expression of genes associated with fatty acid metabolism and neural function that vary with both exposure concentration and sex. In addition, our findings highlight that expression of these genes differs according to exposure duration. The present results extend the knowledge base on PFOS effects to other tissues less often studied than the liver. The findings of the present investigation provide a basis for future studies on the potential risks of PFOS as one of the most abundant PFAAs in the environment. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-13.

AB Advances in engineering biology have expanded the list of renewable compounds that can be produced at scale via biological routes from plant biomass. In most cases, these chemical products have not been evaluated for effects on biological systems, defined in the present study as bioactivity, that may be relevant to their manufacture. For sustainable chemical and fuel production, the industry needs to transition from fossil to renewable carbon sources, resulting in unprecedented expansion in the production and environmental distribution of chemicals used in biomanufacturing. Further, although some chemicals have been assessed for mammalian toxicity, environmental and agricultural hazards are largely unknown. We assessed 6 compounds that are representative of the emerging biofuel and bioproduct manufacturing process for their effect on model plants (Arabidopsis thaliana, Sorghum bicolor) and show that several alter plant seedling physiology at submillimolar concentrations. However, these responses change in the presence of individual bacterial species from the A. thaliana root microbiome. We identified 2 individual microbes that change the effect of chemical treatment on root architecture and a pooled microbial community with different effects relative to its constituents individually. The present study indicates that screening industrial chemicals for bioactivity on model organisms in the presence of their microbiomes is important for biologically and ecologically relevant risk analyses.

AB Freshwater systems are an important source and vector of plastic debris found in oceans. However, plastic debris in freshwater organisms has not been well studied. The occurrence, characterization, polymer composition, and seasonal and spatial distribution of plastic debris were investigated in 9 species of wild freshwater fish from the Pearl River catchment, south China. Approximately 50% of the total fish (n = 279) belonging to 9 species were found to ingest plastic debris with an average abundance of 7.0 +/- 23.8 items/individual, indicating wide plastic contamination in the Pearl River catchment. Plastic debris were predominantly transparent or white in color, fibers or fragments in shape, and polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene-propylene copolymer (PE-PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in polymer composition. A species-specific distribution of the plastic debris was observed in terms of abundance, shape, and polymer composition. Redbelly tilapia had the highest (27.4 +/- 54.0 items/individual), whereas common carp had the lowest (0.2 +/- 0.4 items/individual) abundance of the plastic debris in their gastrointestinal tracts. Fibers of PET were predominant in the freshwater species except in barbel chubs, which had mostly PE-PP fragments. Omnivores and bottom-dwellers were more likely to ingest plastic debris. Seasonal variation was observed, with generally higher abundance of plastic debris in fish collected in the dry season than in the wet season. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1504-1513. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB It is well established that sulfide can be toxic to rooted aquatic plants. However, a detailed description of the effects of cumulative sulfate loads on sulfide and iron (Fe) porewater geochemistry, plant exposure, and ecological response is lacking. Over 4 yr, we experimentally manipulated sulfate loads to self-perpetuating wild rice (Zizania palustris) populations and monitored increases in the ratio of sulfur (S) to Fe in sediment across a range of sulfide loading rates driven by overlying water sulfate. Because natural settings are complicated by ongoing Fe and S loads from surface and groundwater, this experimental setting provides a tractable system to describe the impacts of increased S loading on Fe-S porewater geochemistry. In the experimental mesocosms, the rate of sulfide accumulation in bulk sediment increased linearly with overlying water sulfate concentration up to 300 mu g-SO4 cm(-3). Seedling survival at the beginning of the annual life cycle and seed mass and maturation at the end of the annual life cycle all decreased at porewater sulfide concentrations between 0.4 and 0.7 mu g cm(-3). Changes to porewater sulfide, plant emergence, and plant nutrient uptake during seed production were closely related to the ratio of S to Fe in sediment. A mass balance analysis showed that porewater sulfide remained a small and relatively transient phase compared to sulfate in the overlying water and Fe in the sediment solid phase. The results illuminate the evolution of the geochemical setting and timescales over which 4 yr of cumulative sulfate loading resulted in a wholesale shift from Fe-dominated to sulfide-dominated porewater chemistry. This shift was accompanied by detrimental effects to, and eventual extirpation of, self-perpetuating wild rice populations. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1231-1244. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB Sorption of chemical substances to nanoparticles (NPs) in the aqueous phase strongly influences NP physicochemisty, and investigations of these complex interactions can provide important insights into the environmental fate of NPs. The objective of the present study was to use differences in copper (Cu) bioavailability to investigate aqueous-phase sorption with NPs that had different physicochemical characteristics (silicon [Si], perovskite, and titanium dioxide NPs [TiO2 NPs]). Sorption of Cu with NPs was assessed by the presence of adsorbent in water and onto the NP surface after ultracentrifugation, and by changes in Cu bioavailability under static conditions during exposure of larval zebrafish, as well as under conditions of continuous agitation during exposure of the alga Chlorella vulgaris. The presence of TiO2 NPs reduced total Cu in the water column and Cu bioavailability (measured by growth inhibition, mortality, and metallothionein 2 gene expression), confirming Cu sorption to TiO2 NPs. Nanoparticle surface area was the most important factor that affected Cu sorption, as indicated by less bioavailable Cu in the presence of smaller TiO2 NPs. The surface area effect was consistent regardless of exposure conditions (alga, continuous agitation; zebrafish, static water) and was further supported by the fact that the lowest total Cu concentration in the water column was found in the presence of the smallest NP. The results differed with other NP types, for example, silicon NPs, in which Cu sorption was indicated by analytical chemistry, but sorption was not sufficient to significantly alter Cu bioavailability. The bioavailability tests did not indicate Cu sorption with perovskite NPs. The results demonstrate that surface area critically influences sorption, that Cu sorption as measured by bioavailability is not affected by agitation or static conditions, and that Cu sorption differs among types of NPs, indicating differences in their surface physicochemistry.

AB Neonicotinoids are water-soluble neurotoxic insecticides widely used in agriculture that are being detected in nontarget aquatic environments. Nontarget aquatic wildlife, such as amphibians, may be at risk of exposure. Studies using larval stages suggest neonicotinoids are a minor concern to amphibians; however, behavioral effects manifesting later in life are not often considered. Behavioral endpoints could further our understanding of potential sublethal neurotoxic effects after exposure has ended. Using juvenile wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), we investigated the effects of chronic larval exposure to 3 concentrations (1, 10, and 100 mu g/L) of formulations containing imidacloprid or thiamethoxam on the putative escape response to a simulated heron attack. We found that control frogs actively responded (i.e., moved or jumped) to the simulated predator attack but frogs exposed to imidacloprid at 10 and 100 mu g/L were less likely to respond. The exposed frogs, specifically from the imidacloprid treatment at 10 mu g/L (tendency at 100 mu g/L) were less likely to leave the attack area compared with controls. However, frogs used refuge similarly among all treatments. Finally, there were no differences in locomotor performance, as measured by total number of jumps and distance traveled during a trial among treatments. In conclusion, our study suggests that exposure to neonicotinoids during amphibian larval development may affect a juvenile frog's ability to perceive or respond to a predator, potentially increasing their vulnerability to predation. Future studies should validate and explore this potential effect further. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:3115-3123. (c) 2018 Crown in the right of Canada.

AB Freshwater mussels are generally underrepresented in toxicity databases used to derive water quality criteria, especially for long-term exposures. Multiple tests were conducted to determine the chronic toxicity of sodium chloride (NaCl) or potassium chloride (KCl) to a unionid mussel (fatmucket, Lampsilis siliquoidea). Initially, a 4-wk NaCl test and a 4-wk KCl test were conducted starting with 2-mo-old mussels in water exposures with and without a thin layer of sand substrate. A feeding study was conducted later to refine test conditions for longer-term 12-wk exposures, and 3 chronic NaCl tests were then conducted following the refined method to assess the influence of test duration (4-12 wk) and age of organisms (starting age similar to 1 wk to 2 mo) on mussel sensitivity. Biomass (total dry wt of surviving mussels in a replicate) was generally a more sensitive endpoint compared to survival and growth (length and dry wt). In the 4-wk NaCl or KCl test started with 2-mo-old juveniles, a 20% effect concentration (EC20) based on biomass (264 mg Cl/L from the NaCl test or 8.7 mg K/L from the KCl test) in the exposure with sand was 2-fold lower than the EC20 in the exposure without sand. The longer-term 12-wk NaCl tests started with the 1-wk-old and 2-mo-old juveniles were successfully completed under refined test conditions based on the feeding study, and younger juveniles were more sensitive to NaCl than older juveniles. The NaCl toxicity did not substantially change with extended exposure periods from 4 to 12 wk, although the 4-wk EC20s for biomass were slightly greater (up to 37%) than the 12-wk EC20s in the 2 longer-term exposures. Including the toxicity data from the present study into existing databases would rank fatmucket the most sensitive species to KCl and the second most sensitive species to NaCl for all freshwater organisms.

AB Artificial sand replenishments are globally used as innovative coastal protection measures. In these replenishments elevated porewater concentrations of trace elements are found. The present study investigated possible ecotoxicological risks at 2 intertidal depositional sites, the Sand Engine as a recent innovative Dutch coastal management project and a semiartificial tidal flat. Using the sediment quality triad approach, we considered 3 major lines of evidence: geochemical characterization, toxicity characterization using bioassays with the estuarine amphipod Corophium volutator, and ecological field survey. In both depositional areas C. volutator is at risk: moderate (Sand Engine) and low (tidal flat). For tidal flat, the bioavailability of trace elements differs between the field site and the laboratory. Contamination from arsenic and copper is present, but the low survival rate of C. volutator from the bioassay suggests the presence of additional contaminations. The highly morphological dynamic environment of Sand Engine creates a less favorable habitat for C. volutator, where local spots with stagnant water can temporarily create hypoxic conditions and sulfate becomes reduced. The dynamic system mobilizes especially arsenic, triggering adverse ecotoxic effects at low original sediment concentrations. To conclude, the sediment quality triad approach shows that a semiartificial tidal flat is preferred over a highly dynamic coastal management project like the Sand Engine. The Sand Engine concept does not provide suitable conditions for macrobenthos species like C. volutator; therefore, limiting the nature development goal set together with the coastal protection goal. Assessing each line of evidence from the approach together with additional measurements established more precise and realistic conclusions, showing that evaluating the contributions of this method is necessary to understand the causes of risk in a site-specific manner.

AB Ecotoxicological studies mainly consist of single-species experiments evaluating the effects of a single stressor. However, under natural conditions aquatic communities are exposed to a mixture of stressors. The present study aimed to identify how the toxicity of zinc (Zn) is affected by increased temperature and increased phosphorus (P) supply and how these interactions vary among species, functional groups, and community structure and function. Aquatic microcosms were subjected to 3 Zn concentrations (background, no Zn added, and 75 and 300g Zn/L), 2 temperatures (16-19 and 21-24 degrees C), and 2 different P additions (low, 0.02, and high, 0.4mgP L(-1)wk(-1)) for 5 wk using a full factorial design. During the study, consistent interactions between Zn and temperature were only rarely found at the species level (4%), but were frequently found at the functional group level (36%), for community structure (100%) and for community function (100%; such as dissolved organic carbon concentrations and total chlorophyll). The majority of the Znxtemperature interactions were observed at 300g Zn/L and generally indicated a smaller effect of Zn at higher temperature. Furthermore, no clear indication was found that high P addition by itself significantly affected the overall effects of Zn on the community at any level of organization. Interestingly, though, 90% of all the Znxtemperature interactions observed at the species, group, and community composition level were found under high P addition. Collectively, the results of our study with the model chemical Zn suggest that temperature and phosphorus loading to freshwater systems should be accounted for in risk assessment, because these factors may modify the effects of chemicals on the structure and functioning of aquatic communities, especially at higher levels of biological organization.

AB It is generally assumed that as long as the majority of species experiences no direct adverse effects attributable to a single substance (i.e., potentially affected fraction [PAF] <5%), no significant structural or functional effects at the community level are expected to occur. Whether this assumption holds for mixed metal contamination is not known. In the present study, we tested this by performing a microcosm experiment in which a naturally occurring freshwater planktonic community was exposed to a copper-nickel-zinc (Cu-Ni-Zn) mixture for 8 wk and various structural and functional community-level traits were assessed. In the low mixture concentration treatments (i.e., Ni-Zn mixtures, because there was no difference in Cu concentrations in these treatments with the control), community-level effects were relatively simple, only involving phytoplankton species groups. In the high mixture concentration treatments (Cu-Ni-Zn mixtures), community-level effects were more complex, involving several phytoplankton and zooplankton species groups. Multisubstance PAF (msPAF) values for all mixture treatments were calculated by applying the concentration addition model to bioavailability-normalized single-metal species sensitivity distributions (SSDs). Consistent effects on the structural traits community composition, abundance of zooplankton species groups, species diversity, and species richness and on the functional trait dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (as a proxy for the microbial loop and pelagic food web interactions) were only observed at msPAF values >0.05 (i.e., in the Cu-Ni-Zn mixture). However, consistent effects on the abundance of various phytoplankton species groups (structural traits) and on 2 measures of community respiration, overnight dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH (functional traits), were already observed at msPAF values of 0.05 (i.e., in the Ni-Zn mixture). This indicates that the threshold msPAF value of 0.05 was not protective against metal mixture exposure for all community-level structural and functional endpoints in the present study. A possible explanation for this result is the mismatch between the species in the SSD and those in our microcosm community. Indeed, our data suggest that the presence of one single dominant and very Zn- and/or Ni-sensitive species in the investigated community (i.e., a cyanobacteria of the genus Oscillatoria), which is not represented in the SSD of these metals, was probably the driver of all observed effects at or below an msPAF of 0.05. Overall, the present results show that SSDs are not necessarily a good predictor of community-level effects for all types of communities and that the presence of dominant sensitive species may result in significant, consistent effects on certain structural and functional community-level endpoints at msPAF values 0.05, which is generally considered protective in many regulatory frameworks.

AB Despite the consensus about the importance of chemical speciation in controlling the bioavailability and ecotoxicity of trace elements, detailed speciation studies during laboratory ecotoxicity testing remain scarce, contributing to uncertainty when extrapolating laboratory findings to real field situations in risk assessment. We characterized the speciation and ecotoxicological effects of chromium (Cr-III and Cr-VI) in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) medium for algal ecotoxicity testing. Total and dissolved (< 0.22 mu m) Cr concentrations showed little variability in media spiked with Cr-VI, whereas dissolved Cr concentration decreased by as much as 80% over a 72-h time period in medium amended with Cr-III. Analyses by ion chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (IC-ICP-MS) highlighted the absence of redox interconversion between Cr-III or Cr-VI both in the presence and absence of algal cells (Raphidocelis subcapitata). Furthermore, the concentration of ionic Cr-III dropped below detection limits in less than 2 h with the corresponding formation of carbonate complexes and Cr hydroxides. Precipitation of Cr-III in the form of colloidal particles of variable diameters was confirmed by nanoparticle (NP) tracking analysis, single particle ICP-MS, and single particle counting. In terms of time-weighted dissolved (< 0.22 mu m) Cr concentration, Cr-III was 4 to 10 times more toxic than Cr-VI. However, Cr-III ecotoxicity could arise from interactions between free ionic Cr-III and algae at the beginning of the test, from the presence of Cr-bearing NPs, or from a combination of the 2. Future ecotoxicological studies must pay more attention to Cr speciation to reliably compare the ecotoxicity of Cr-III and Cr-VI. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Degradation is one of the key processes governing the impact of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. Most studies on the degradation of pharmaceuticals have focused on soil and sludge, with fewer exploring persistence in aquatic sediments. We investigated the dissipation of 6 pharmaceuticals from different therapeutic classes in a range of sediment types. Dissipation of each pharmaceutical was found to follow first-order exponential decay. Half-lives in the sediments ranged from 9.5 (atenolol) to 78.8 (amitriptyline) d. Under sterile conditions, the persistence of pharmaceuticals was considerably longer. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore the relationships between half-lives of the pharmaceuticals, sediment physicochemical properties, and sorption coefficients for the compounds. Sediment clay, silt, and organic carbon content and microbial activity were the predominant factors related to the degradation rates of diltiazem, cimetidine, and ranitidine. Regression analysis failed to highlight a key property which may be responsible for observed differences in the degradation of the other pharmaceuticals. The present results suggest that the degradation rate of pharmaceuticals in sediments is determined by different factors and processes and does not exclusively depend on a single sediment parameter.

AB Responses of organisms to sublethal exposure of environmental stressors can be difficult to detect. We investigated phenotypic changes in the tissue of Caenorhabditis elegans via Raman spectroscopy, as well as survival and reproductive output when exposed to chronic low doses of metals (copper, zinc, or silver), an herbicide (diuron), and a pesticide (imidacloprid). Raman spectroscopy measures changes in phenotype by providing information about the molecular composition and relative abundance of biomolecules. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the significance of treatment phenotype segregation plots compared with controls. Dose-dependent responses were observed for copper, zinc, silver, and diuron, whereas imidacloprid exposure resulted in a small response over the tested concentrations. Concentration-dependent shifts in nematode biomolecular phenotype were observed for copper. Despite having a dose-dependent reproductive response, silver, diuron, and imidacloprid produced inconsistent biological phenotype patterns. In contrast, there was a clear stepwise change between low concentrations (0.00625-0.5mg/L) and higher concentration (1-2mg/L) of ionic zinc. The findings demonstrate that measuring phenotypic responses via Raman spectroscopy can provide insights into the biomolecular mechanisms of toxicity. Despite the lack of consistency between survival and Raman-measured phenotypic changes, the results support the effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy and multivariate analysis to detect sublethal responses of chemicals in whole organisms and to identify toxic effect thresholds.

AB Freshwater mussels may be exposed to elevations in mean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) caused by both natural and anthropogenic factors. The goal of the present study was to assess the effects of a 28-d elevation in pCO(2) at 15 000 and 50 000 mu atm on processes associated with biomineralization, ion regulation, and cellular stress in adult Lampsilis siliquoidea (Barnes, 1823). In addition, the capacity for mussels to compensate for acid-base disturbances experienced after exposure to elevated pCO(2) was assessed over a 14-d recovery period. Overall, exposure to 50 000 mu atm pCO(2) had more pronounced physiological consequences compared with 15 000 mu atm pCO(2). Over the first 7 d of exposure to 50 000 mu atm pCO(2), the mRNA abundance of chitin synthase (cs), calmodulin (cam), and calmodulin-like protein (calp) were significantly affected, suggesting that shell formation and integrity may be altered during pCO(2) exposure. After the removal of the pCO(2) treatment, mussels may compensate for the acid-base and ion disturbances experienced during pCO(2) exposure, and transcript levels of some regulators of biomineralization (carbonic anhydrase [ca], cs, cam, calp) as well as ion regulation (na(+)-k(+)-adenosine triphosphatase [nka]) were modulated. Effects of elevated pCO(2) on heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) were limited in the present study. Overall, adult L. siliquoidea appeared to regulate factors associated with the control of biomineralization and ion regulation during and/or after the removal of pCO(2) exposure. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB In the aquatic tier-1 effect assessment for plant protection products with an herbicidal mode of action in Europe, it is usually algae and/or vascular plants that determine the environmental risks. This tier includes tests with at least 2 algae and 1 macrophyte (Lemna). Although such tests are considered to be of a chronic nature (based on the duration of the test in relation to the life cycle of the organism), the measurement endpoints derived from the laboratory tests with plants (including algae) and used in the first-tier effect assessment for herbicides are acute effect concentrations affecting 50% of the test organisms (EC50 values) and not no-observed-effect concentrations (NOECs) or effect concentrations affecting 10% of the test organisms (EC10) values. Other European legislative frameworks (e.g., the Water Framework Directive) use EC10 values. The present study contributes to a validation of the tiered herbicide risk assessment approach by comparing the standard first-tier effect assessment with results of microcosm and mesocosm studies. We evaluated EC50 and EC10 values for standard test algae and macrophytes based on either the growth rate endpoint (E(r)C50) or the lowest available endpoint for growth rate or biomass/yield (E-r/E(y)C50). These values were compared with the regulatory acceptable concentrations for the threshold option as derived from microcosm and mesocosm studies. For these studies, protection is maintained if growth rate is taken as the regulatory endpoint instead of the lowest value of either growth rate or biomass/yield in conjunction with the standard assessment factor of 10. Based on a limited data set of 14 herbicides, we did not identify a need to change the current practice. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Pyrethroids are insecticides widely used to control pests and disease vectors in residential areas and agricultural lands. Pyrethroids are emerging pollutants, and their use is a growing concern because of their toxicity potential to aquatic organisms. Todos Santos Bay and the Punta Banda estuary, 2 coastal bodies located to the south of the Southern California Bight, were studied to establish a baseline of the current conditions of pollution by pyrethroids and fipronil. Eight pyrethroids, along with fipronil and its 2 metabolites, were determined in effluents from wastewater-treatment plants (n=3), surface sediments (n=32), and 3 locations with mussels (Mytilus californianus, n=9). Bifenthrin, permethrin, and cypermethrin were the most common pyrethroids found in the study areas and were widespread in sediments, mussels, and wastewater-treated effluents. Fipronil and its metabolites were detected in mussels and wastewater-treated effluents only. Total pyrethroid concentrations in sediments ranged from 0.04 to 1.95ng/g dry weight in the Punta Banda estuary (n=13) and from 0.07 to 6.62ng/g dry weight in Todos Santos Bay (n=19). Moreover, total pyrethroids in mussels ranged from 1.19 to 6.15ng/g wet weight. Based on the toxic unit data calculated for pyrethroids and fipronil for Eohaustorius estuarius and Hyalella azteca, little to no impact is expected to the benthic population structure.

AB The effectiveness of activated carbon in reducing the bioavailability of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was examined from the context of using in situ sorbent amendments to remediate soils/sediments contaminated with polychlorinated dibenzop- dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). This technology has gained rapid acceptance based on observations that activated carbon amendments predictably lower PCDD/F concentrations in water and bioaccumulation by simple aquatic organisms and earthworms; it has been assumed that bioavailability to mammals is similarly reduced, although this has been disproven for other sorbent materials. In the present study TCDD was absorbed to a microporous activated carbon (TCDD-AC) using the incipient wetness method. An aqueous suspension of TCDD-AC and an equivalent dosage of TCDD in corn oil were administered by oral gavage to B6C3F1 mice. The relative bioavailability of TCDD-AC was determined by quantifying and comparing the hepatic induction of cyp1A1 (messenger ribonucleic acid) and suppression of the immunoglobulin M antibody-forming cell immune response by the 2 forms of TCDD. A concentration-dependent response was observed for both assays when TCDD in corn oil was administered to mice. However, when equivalent masses of TCDD were administered as TCDD-AC, no induction of cyp1A1 or suppression of the immunoglobulin M antibody-forming cell response was observed. The absence of these 2 sensitive aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated responses in mice provides the first direct evidence that activated carbon can sequester TCDD in a form that eliminates its bioavailability to mammals. These results support the premise that activated carbon can be used to reduce the bioeffective dose of TCDD delivered to mammals and that activated carbon amendments may provide a low-cost alternative to traditional remediation technologies.

AB Domestic sewage is a major problem in highly urbanized coastal areas worldwide. In the present study, toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) phases I and II were applied to sediment interstitial water from 2 locations along the Sao Paulo coast in southeastern Brazil: the sewage outfalls from the city of Santos, a densely urbanized area, and the city of Bertioga, a less urbanized area. An adapted microscale sea urchin embryo-larval development bioassay was employed. Phase TIE-I manipulations were 1) ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) addition, 2) aeration at modified pH, 3) C18 solid-phase extraction (SPE), and 4) addition of Na2S2O3. The results of the Santos TIE-I indicated toxicity by sulfides and substances with affinity to C18 resin. In Bertioga, toxicity was the result of NH3, metals, and arsenic, as well as substances with affinity to C18 resin. Phase TIE-II aimed to specify the causes of toxicity by testing the toxicity of eluates of the sublation and C18 SPE manipulation. The results reinforced the role of both surfactants and nonpolar compounds as causative agents of toxicity in both Santos and Bertioga. Chemical analyses of sediment interstitial water or whole sediment ruled out the influence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the toxicity of both sampling sites. Other hydrophobic substances may play a role in the toxicity of Santos and Bertioga effluents. Efforts to remove such substances from sanitary effluents must be prioritized. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB The present study examines the uptake of the heavy metal cadmium (Cd) by Microcystis aeruginosa in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from different origins. The DOM used in the present study were extracted from soil, sediment taken from Meiliang Bay at Taihu Lake, and from M. aeruginosa cultured in the laboratory. The 3 different DOM samples were characterized using ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize the interactions of DOM with Cd2+. The results showed that all types of DOM extracted from the 3 sources in the present study exhibited aliphatic and aromatic characteristics and contained hydroxyls, carbonyls, phenols, carboxyls, carbohydrates, amines, and ethers. Humic acids and fulvic acids proved to be the major components of DOM. The sediment DOM had the highest degrees of aromatization and humification among the samples. The results also showed that sediment and soil DOM samples had lower molecular weights than M. aeruginosa DOM. The DOM could react with Cd2+ by complexing to alter Cd speciation. When exposed to Cd, EEM fluorescence intensities of all 3 DOM types had a significant decrease, and the intracellular Cd content improved with increasing Cd concentrations. The addition of DOM greatly enhanced Cd uptake by M. aeruginosa compared with the control group. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Nano-titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most widely used form of nanoparticles in commercial industry and comes in 2 main configurations: rutile and anatase. Rutile TiO2 is used in ultraviolet (UV) screening applications, whereas anatase TiO2 crystals have a surface defect that makes them photoreactive. There are numerous reports in the literature of photo-induced toxicity to aquatic organisms following coexposure to anatase nano-TiO2 and UV. All natural freshwater contains varying amounts of natural organic matter (NOM), which can drive UV attenuation and quench reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aquatic ecosystems. The present research examined how NOM alters the photo-induced toxicity of anatase nano-TiO2. Daphnia magna neonates were coexposed to NOM and photoexcited anatase nano-TiO2 for 48 h. Natural organic matter concentrations as low as 4 mg/L reduced anatase nano-TiO2 toxicity by nearly 100%. These concentrations of NOM attenuated UV by <10% in the exposure system. However, ROS production measured using a fluorescence assay was significantly reduced in a NOM concentration-dependent manner. Taken together, these data suggest that NOM reduces anatase nano-TiO2 toxicity via an ROS quenching mechanism and not by attenuation of UV. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Earthworms were shown to significantly avoid soils spiked with Pb at concentrations lower than or comparable to concentrations that demonstrate significant effects for other endpoints. It was also shown that inclusion of a microorganism-produced volatile compound that attracts earthworms, ethyl valerate, decreased avoidance of spiked soils. These findings suggest that care should be taken when analyzing earthworm avoidance of soils in which microorganism communities are not controlled. (C) 2016 SETAC.

AB Determining the rate of biodegradation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the environment is an essential element of a comprehensive risk assessment of an RNA-based agricultural product. This information is used during problem formulation to define relevant routes and durations of environmental exposure for in planta-expressed dsRNA. Although exposure to biotechnology-derived crops expressing dsRNA traits in the aquatic environment is predicted to be minimal, little is known regarding the fate of dsRNA in these environments. To assess exposure to aquatic environments, a study was conducted to measure the rate of biodegradation of DvSnf7 dsRNA in aerobic water-sediment systems. Aquatic systems containing natural water and sediments that varied in physical and chemical characteristics were treated with dsRNA by applying DvSnf7 dsRNA directly to the water column. In the present study, DvSnf7 dsRNA dissipated rapidly from the water phase and was undetectable within 7 d as measured by QuantiGene (Affymetrix) and a sensitive insect bioassay in these diverse systems. Degradation kinetics estimated a half-life (time to 50% dissipation [DT50]) of less than 3 d and a time to 90% dissipation of approximately 4 d. Further analysis indicated that DvSnf7 dsRNA had DT50 values of less than 6 d in both sediment-free systems containing natural water and systems with only sediment. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that dsRNA-based agricultural products rapidly degrade and consequently are unlikely to persist in aquatic environments. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Anthropogenic sources increase freshwater salinity and produce differences in constituent ions compared with natural waters. Moreover, ions differ in physiological roles and concentrations in intracellular and extracellular fluids. Four freshwater taxa groups are compared, to investigate similarities and differences in ion transport processes and what ion transport mechanisms suggest about the toxicity of these or other ions in freshwater. Although differences exist, many ion transporters are functionally similar and may belong to evolutionarily conserved protein families. For example, the Na+/H+-exchanger in teleost fish differs from the H+/2Na(+)(or Ca2+)-exchanger in crustaceans. In osmoregulation, Na+ and Cl- predominate. Stenohaline freshwater animals hyperregulate until they are no longer able to maintain hypertonic extracellular Na+ and Cl- concentrations with increasing salinity and become isotonic. Toxic effects of K+ are related to ionoregulation and volume regulation. The ionic balance between intracellular and extracellular fluids is maintained by Na-vertical bar/K-vertical bar-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), but details are lacking on apical K-vertical bar transporters. Elevated H-vertical bar affects the maintenance of internal Na+ by Na+/H+ exchange; elevated HCO3- inhibits Cl- uptake. The uptake of Mg2+ occurs by the gills or intestine, but details are lacking on Mg2+ transporters. In unionid gills, SO42- is actively transported, but most epithelia are generally impermeant to SO42-. Transporters of Ca2+ maintain homeostasis of dissolved Ca2+. More integration of physiology with toxicology is needed to fully understand freshwater ion effects. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017; 36: 576-600. Published 2016 Wiley Periodicals Inc. on behalf of SETAC.

AB Environmental risk assessment is often challenged by a lack of toxicity data for ecological species. The overall goal of the present study was to employ an avian early-life stage toxicity test to determine the effects of 4 chemicals (benzo[a]pyrene [BaP], chlorpyrifos, fluoxetine hydrochloride [FLX], and ethinyl estradiol [EE2]) on an ecologically relevant avian species, the double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), and to compare our results with those we previously reported for a laboratory model species, Japanese quail. Chemicals were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and administered via air cell injection to fertilized, unincubated double-crested cormorant eggs at 3 nominal concentrations, the highest selected to approximate the 20% lethal dose. Of the 4 chemicals, only chlorpyrifos and FLX were detected in liver tissue of embryos at midincubation (day 14) and termination (day 26; 1-2 d prior to hatch); EE2 and BaP were not detectable, suggesting embryonic clearance/metabolism. No apical effects were observed in double-crested cormorant embryos up to the highest concentrations of chlorpyrifos (no-observed-effect level [NOEL] = 25 mu g/g) or FLX (NOEL = 18 mu g/g). Exposure to EE2 reduced embryonic viability and increased deformities at a concentration of 2.3 mu g/g (NOEL = 0.18 mu g/g), and BaP decreased embryonic viability (median lethal dose = 0.015 mu g/g; NOEL = 0.0027 mu g/g). Compared with Japanese quail, double-crested cormorant were more sensitive with regard to embryolethality and deformities for EE2 and embryolethality for BaP, whereas they were less sensitive to embryonic deformities associated with chlorpyrifos exposure. These data reinforce the idea that standardized toxicity tests using a laboratory model species may not always be protective of wild birds, and thus they stress the importance of developing such alternative testing strategies (e.g., the EcoToxChip Project) for ecologically relevant species to augment risk assessment efforts.

AB For several years now, the Natural Resources Canada research facility at CanmetENERGY Devon (AB, Canada) has been performing experiments in a pilot-scale spill tank using 1200 L of river water to examine the physical and chemical behaviors of various crude oil/water mixtures under varying water temperature regimes. Because oil toxicity can be modulated by weathering of the petroleum products, the present study aimed to assess changes in fish embryotoxicity to mixed sweet blend crude oil as it weathered at air and water temperatures of 14 degrees C and 15 degrees C, respectively, for 28 d. The physicochemical behavior of the oil was also monitored. Water samples were taken from the spill tank 5 times during the 28-d experiment on days 1, 6, 14, 21, and 28 and were used to perform toxicity exposures using fathead minnow embryos (Pimephales promelas). For each water sampling day, newly fertilized embryos were exposed to a serial dilution of the spill tank water, noncontaminated river water (used in the spill tank), and a reconstituted water laboratory control. Embryos were raised until hatching. Although mortality was not significantly altered by the oil contamination over the time period, malformation occurrence and severity showed concentration-dependent responses to all contaminated water collected. The results suggest that days 14, 21, and 28 were the most toxic time periods for the fish embryos, which corresponded to increasing concentrations of unidentified oxidized organic compounds detected by a quadropole-time-of-flight system. The present study highlights a novel area for oil research, which could help us to better understand the toxicity associated with oil weathering for aquatic species.

AB A bioconcentration factor (BCF) database and a toxicokinetic model considering only biota-water partitioning and biotransformation were constructed for neutral organic chemicals in midge. The database contained quality-reviewed BCF and toxicokinetic data with variability constrained to within 0.5 to 1 log unit. Diverse conditions in exposure duration, flow set-up, substrate presence, temperature, and taxonomic classification did not translate into substantial variability in BCF, uptake rate constant (k(1)), or depuration rate constant (k(T)), and no systematic bias was observed in BCFs derived in unlabeled versus radiolabeled studies. Substance-specific biotransformation rate constants k(M) were derived by difference between the calculated biota-water partitioning coefficient (K-BW) and experimental BCF for developing a midge biotransformation model. Experimental midge BCF was modeled as BCF = K-BW/(1 + k(M/)k(2)) with log k(M) (k(M) in h(-1)) = -0.37 log K-OW - 0.06T (in K) + 18.87 (root mean square error [RMSE] = 0.60), log k(1) (k(1) in L kg(wet.wt)(-1) h(-1)) = -0.0747 W (body weight in mg(wet.wt)) + 2.35 (RMSE = 0.48). The K-BW value was estimated using midge biochemical composition and established polyparameter linear free energy relationships, and the diffusive elimination rate constant (k(2)) was computed as k(2) = k(1)/K-BW. The BCF model predicted >85% of BCFs that associated with neutral organic compounds (log K-OW = 1.46 - 7.75) to within 1 log-unit error margin and had comparable accuracy similar to amphipod or fish models. A number of outliers and critical limitations of the k(M) model were identified and examined, and they largely reflected the inherent limitation of difference-derived k(M), the lack of chemical diversity, and inadequate temperature variation in existing data. Future modeling efforts can benefit from more BCF and toxicokinetic observations of BCF on structurally diverse chemicals for model training, validation, and diagnosis.

AB Natural organic matter (NOM) has long been shown to be the dominant factor in determining equilibrium and kinetic processes during sorption and desorption phenomena in sediment and soil experiments. Although several models have been suggested for predicting these processes, few offer mechanistic interpretations because the spatial location of organic matter on sediment particles is unknown. This investigation manually examined sediment particles from multiple locations, containing varying concentrations of NOM, using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to determine the types of particles present by categorizing them as individual particles, aggregates, and "other" (detritus, algae, etc.). These types of particles were subsequently analyzed for their elemental composition, specifically the spatial location of carbon. By creating a carbon map of each particle, this investigation has determined that organic matter tends to occur in 2 forms: large aggregates or dispersed across individual sediment particles. These findings were then used to propose a more mechanistically sound mathematical model for pollutant desorption phenomena, assigning the traditional labile kinetic release component to the dispersed NOM spread randomly across sediment particles and the nonlabile kinetic release component to diffusion from densely packed NOM aggregates.

AB The importance of considering the bioavailability of metals in understanding and assessing their toxicity in freshwaters has been recognized for many years. Currently, biotic ligand models (BLMs) are being applied for the derivation and implementation of environmental quality standards (EQS) for metals under the Water Framework Directive in Europe. bio-met is a simplified tool that was developed for implementing bioavailability-based EQS for metals in European freshwaters. We demonstrate the reliability of the relationship between the full BLM predictions and the thresholds (hazardous concentration affecting 5% of species [HC5] values) predicted by bio-met in 3 stages, for the metals copper, nickel, and zinc. First, ecotoxicity data for specific species from laboratory tests in natural waters are compared with predictions by the individual species BLMs included in the full BLMs. Second, the site-specific HC5 values predicted by bio-met for the natural waters used for ecotoxicity testing are compared with those provided by the full BLMs. The reliability of both relationships is demonstrated for all 3 metals, with more than 80% of individual species BLM predictions being within a factor of 3 of the experimental results, and 99% of bio-met local HC5 predictions being within a factor of 2 of the full BLM result. Third, using a larger set of European natural waters in addition demonstrates the reliability of bio-met over a broad range of water chemistry conditions. bio-met is therefore an appropriate tool for performing compliance assessments against EQS values in Europe, due to the demonstrated consistency with the toxicity test data.

AB Dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) cause early life stage mortality of vertebrates through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). A prior study developed a cross-species quantitative adverse outcome pathway (qAOP) which can predict full dose-response curves of early life stage mortality for any species of bird or fish exposed to DLCs using the species- and chemical-specific 50% effect concentration (EC50) from an in vitro AhR transactivation assay with COS-7 cells. However, calculating a reliable EC50 for input into this qAOP requires the maximal response of the concentration-response curve to be known, which is not always possible for low-potency agonists, such as some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). To enable predictions for these low-potency agonists, the present study revised this qAOP to use the effect concentration threshold (ECThreshold) from the in vitro AhR transactivation assay as input. Significant linear relationships were demonstrated between EC(Threshold)and the dose to cause 0, 10, 50, or 100% mortality among early life stages of 3 species of birds and 7 species of fish for 4 DLCs: 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, PCB 126, PCB 77, and PCB 105. These 4 linear relationships were combined to form the revised qAOP. This qAOP using the EC(Threshold)enables prediction of experimental dose-response curves for lower-potency agonists to within an order of magnitude on average, but the prior qAOP using EC50 predicts experimental dose-response curves for higher-potency agonists with greater accuracy.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-10.

AB Natural biotic and anthropogenic stressors can interact to alter contaminant toxicity. Energetic restrictions are potential mechanisms causing this pattern. To identify processes underlying observed effects of predation risk and copper (Cu) on delayed copepod age at maturity, we examined how these 2 stressors affect respiration rates. We tested 2 very different copepod species: the large, pelagic calanoidCalanus finmarchicusand the small, semibenthic harpacticoidTigriopus brevicornis. Adult individuals were exposed for 12 h to the treatments: predation risk, Cu (23 mu g L-1), combined predation risk and Cu (23 mu g L-1), or control. Oxygen concentrations were monitored continuously. The 2 species differed in their responses. We found no clear effects of either stressor inC. finmarchicus. InT. brevicornis, predation risk increased respiration rates, whereas Cu alone had little impact. In contrast, combined exposure to predation risk and Cu interacted to reduce respiration rates to less than expected. We further observed an effect of sex because female-biasedT. brevicornisreplicates were more sensitive to both predation risk (increased respiration rates) and Cu exposure (reduced respiration rates). The present study provides further evidence that predation risk can interact with copepod responses toward Cu exposure. Interactive effects of biotic stressors ought to be considered to improve future marine environmental monitoring.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-9.

AB Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have exacerbated the decline of native freshwater mussels (order Unionida) in North America since their arrival in the 1980s. Options for controlling invasive mussels, particularly in unionid mussel habitats, are limited. Previously, carbon dioxide (CO2) showed selective toxicity for zebra mussels, relative to unionids, when applied in cool water (12 degrees C). We first determined 96-h lethal concentrations of CO(2)at 5 and 20 degrees C to zebra mussels and responses of juvenile plain pocketbook (Lampsilis cardium). Next, we compared the time to lethality for zebra mussels at 5, 12, and 20 degrees C during exposure to partial pressure of CO2(PCO2) values of 110 to 120 atm (1 atm = 101.325 kPa) and responses of juvenile plain pocketbook and fragile papershell (Leptodea fragilis). We found efficacious CO(2)treatment regimens at each temperature that were minimally lethal to unionids. At 5 degrees C, plain pocketbook survived 96-h exposure to the highest PCO(2)treatment (139 atm). At 20 degrees C, the 96-h lethal concentration to 10% of animals (LC10) for plain pocketbook (173 atm PCO2, 95% CI 147-198 atm) was higher than the LC99 for zebra mussels (118 atm PCO2, 95% CI 109-127 atm). Lethal time to 99% mortality (LT99) of zebra mussels in 110 to 120 atm PCO(2)ranged from 100 h at 20 degrees C to 300 h at 5 degrees C. Mean survival of both plain pocketbook and fragile papershell juveniles exceeded 85% in LT99 CO(2)treatments at all temperatures. Short-term infusion of 100 to 200 atm PCO(2)at a range of water temperatures could reduce biofouling by zebra mussels with limited adverse effects on unionid mussels.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-12.

ID IDENTIFICATION; FORMULATIONS
AB 3-Trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) has been used for more than 60 yr to control the invasive parasitic sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) in the Great Lakes Basin (USA/Canada). In the early 1990s, researchers reported that TFM induced vitellogenin in fish and that TFM was an agonist for the rainbow trout estrogen receptor. To support continued registration of TFM for sea lamprey control, regulatory agencies required further testing to evaluate potential endocrine disruption effects. Fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) were exposed to TFM at measured concentrations of 0.0659, 0.181, 0.594, 1.79, and 5.11 mg active ingredient (a.i.)/L for 21 d. No-observable- and lowest-observable-effect concentrations (NOEC and LOEC, respectively) were determined to be 1.79 mg/L or greater for each endpoint. Male survival in the highest treatment group was reduced relative to the controls. Percentage of egg fertility was reduced in the highest treatment group, resulting in an estimated NOEC of 1.79 mg/L. Whereas no effect on the gonadosomatic index (GSI) was observed for males, female GSI was increased in the 5.11-mg/L treatment. Vitellogenin production was not altered relative to the controls for all TFM treatment groups. However, female testosterone was elevated in the 5.11-mg/L treatment. The results suggest that prolonged exposure to TFM at concentrations exceeding 1.79 mg/L has the potential to disrupt endocrine function. Biologically relevant effects were found at the highest exposure concentration following a 21-d exposure. However, the duration of exposure in our study is not consistent with typical treatment durations (12 h) for sea lamprey control.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-9. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB The potential toxicity to human and aquatic receptors of petroleum fuel biodegradation metabolites (oxygen-containing organic compounds [OCOCs]) in groundwater has been investigated as part of a multi-year research program. Whole mixtures collected from locations upgradient and downgradient of multiple fuel release sites were tested using: 1) in vitro screening assays for human genotoxicity (the gamma-H2AX assay) and estrogenic effects (estrogen receptor transcriptional activation assay), and 2) chronic aquatic toxicity tests in 3 species (Ceriodaphnia dubia,Raphidocelis subcapitata, andPimephales promelas). In vitro screening assay results demonstrated that the mixtures did not cause genotoxic or estrogenic effects. No OCOC-related aquatic toxicity was observed and when aquatic toxicity did occur, upgradient samples typically had the same response as samples downgradient of the release, indicating that background water quality was impacting the results. This information provides additional support for previous work that focused on the individual compounds and, taken together, indicates that OCOCs from petroleum degradation at fuel release sites are unlikely to cause toxicity to human or freshwater receptors at the concentrations present.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-12.

AB During clarification processes of raw water, a vast amount of by-product known as "drinking water-treatment residuals" (WTRs) are produced, being principally composed of hydroxides of the Al or Fe salts added during water treatment plus the impurities they remove. Aluminum-based (Al-WTR) and iron-based (Fe-WTR) materials were applied at 10% w/w to degraded, bare (unvegetated) soils from a restored coal mining site in central England (pH <3.9) to study their potential amelioration effects on earthworm mortality, biomass yield of seedling plants, and element concentrations in plant tissues, earthworm tissues, and soil solutions. A separate treatment with agricultural lime was also conducted for comparison to evaluate whether any observed improvements were attributable to the liming capacity of the WTRs. After completion of the trials, all samples were subjected to a wet-dry cycle, and the experiments were repeated (i.e., simulating longer-term effects in the field). Both types of WTRs significantly increased the biomass of plants, and in some treatments, survival of earthworms was also enhanced compared to nonamended soils. Excess plant tissue element concentrations and element concentrations in soil solutions were reduced in amended soils. The implications are that adding WTRs to mining-impacted soils is a potentially viable, sustainable, and low-cost remediation method that could be used globally to improve the soil condition.

AB Studies of the toxicity of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on amphibians, especially after metamorphosis, are limited. We examined effects of dermal PFAS exposure (30 d) on survival and growth of juvenile American toads (Anaxyrus americanus), eastern tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum), and northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens). Chemicals included perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS) at 0, 80, 800, or 8000 ppb on a moss dry weight basis. Exposure to PFAS influenced final snout-vent length (SVL) and scaled mass index (SMI), a measure of relative body condition. Observed effects depended on species and chemical, but not concentration. Anurans exposed to PFOS, PFHxS (frogs only), and 6:2 FTS demonstrated reduced SVL versus controls, whereas salamanders exposed to 6:2 FTS showed increased SVL. Frogs exposed to PFHxS and 6:2 FTS and toads exposed to PFOS had increased SMI compared to controls; salamanders did not demonstrate effects. Concentrations of 6:2 FTS in substrate decreased substantially by 30 d, likely driven by microbial action. Perfluorooctane sulfonate had notable biota-sediment accumulation factors, but was still <1. Although a no-observable-effect concentration could not generally be determined, the lowest-observable-effect concentration was 50 to 120 ppb. Survival was not affected. The present study demonstrates that PFAS bioaccumulation from dermal exposures and sublethal effects are dependent on species, chemical, and focal trait. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-10.

AB To accurately predict the environmental fate of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), high-quality physicochemical property data are required. Because such data are often not available from experiments, assessment of the accuracy of existing property estimation models is essential. The quality of predicted physicochemical property data for a set of 25 PFAS was examined using COSMOtherm, EPI Suite, the estimation models accessible through the US Environmental Protection Agency's CompTox Chemicals Dashboard, and Linear Solvation Energy Relationships (LSERs) available through the UFZ-LSER Database. The results showed that COSMOtherm made the most accurate acid dissociation constant and air-water partition ratio estimates compared with literature data. The OPEn structure-activity/property Relationship App (OPERA; developed through the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard) estimates of vapor pressure and dry octanol-air partition ratios were the most accurate compared with other models of interest. Wet octanol-water partition ratios were comparably predicted by OPERA and EPI Suite, and the organic carbon soil coefficient and solubility were well predicted by OPERA and COSMOtherm. Acid dissociation of the perfluoroalkyl acids has a significant impact on their physicochemical properties, and corrections for ionization were included where applicable.

AB Active biomonitoring approaches are now recognized as relevant for monitoring water contamination and toxicity. Nevertheless, due to the confounding influence of variable and uncontrolled environmental conditions such as temperature, biological markers measured on transplanted individuals to assess water quality are difficult to interpret. The purpose of the present study is to propose a methodology for adapting a laboratory test of chronic sublethal toxicity based on the molting cycle of Gammarus fossarum to in situ assays. To this end, we 1) adapted the molt cycle temperature-dependent model developed in Part 1 (Chaumot et al. 2020, this issue) to the fluctuating temperatures measured in the field; 2) assessed the predictive power of our approach as a "reference value" from gammarids caged in 9 nonimpacted sites at different seasons; and 3) tested the relevance of our tool to interpret in situ reproductive bioassays from 5 upstream/downstream studies and a large-scale deployment in 12 sites. Our approach based on modeling the progress of gammarid molting cycle as a function of temperature appeared to be a relevant and robust tool for interpreting in situ observations in different environmental contexts in time and space. By avoiding using a "reference" or upstream situation as a baseline from which water quality could be assessed, this approach provides a real added value to water quality diagnosis in biomonitoring programs.

AB Many metals (aluminum, cadmium, cobalt, copper, nickel, lead, zinc) are widely studied environmental contaminants because of their ubiquity, potential toxicity to aquatic life, and tendency for toxicity to vary widely as a function of water chemistry. The interactions between metal and water chemistry influence metal "bioavailability," an index of the rate and extent to which the metal reaches the site of toxic action. The implications of metal bioavailability for ecological risk assessment are large, with as much as a 100-fold variability across a range of water chemistries in surface waters. Beginning as early as the 1930s, considerable research effort was expended toward documenting and understanding metal bioavailability as a function of total and dissolved metal, water hardness, natural organic matter, pH, and other water characteristics. The understanding of these factors and improvements in both analytical and computational chemistry led to the development of modeling approaches intended to describe and predict the relationship between water chemistry and metal toxicity, including the free ion activity model, the gill surface interaction model, the biotic ligand model, and additional derivatives and regression models that arose from similar knowledge. The arc of these scientific advances can also be traced through the evolution of the US Environmental Protection Agency's ambient water quality criteria over the last 50 yr, from guidance in the "Green Book" (1968) to metal-specific criteria produced in the last decade. Through time, water quality criteria in many jurisdictions have incorporated increasingly sophisticated means of addressing metal bioavailability. The present review discusses the history of scientific understanding of metal bioavailability and the development and application of models to incorporate this knowledge into regulatory practice.

AB To assess potential impacts on receiving systems, associated with storm water contaminants, laboratory 10-d amphipod (Eohaustorius estuarius) survival toxicity tests were performed using intact sediment cores collected from Paleta Creek (San Diego Bay, CA, USA) on 5 occasions between 2015 and 2017. The approach included deposition-associated sediment particles collected from sediment traps placed at each of 4 locations during the 2015 to 2016 wet seasons. The bioassays demonstrated wet season toxicity, especially closest to the creek mouth, and greater mortality associated with particles deposited in the wet season compared with dry season samples. Grain size analysis of sediment trap material indicated coarser sediment at the mouth of the creek and finer sediment in the outer depositional areas. Contaminant concentrations of metals (Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and organic compounds (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], and pesticides) were quantified to assess possible causes of toxicity. Contaminant concentrations were determined in the top 5 cm of sediment and porewater (using passive samplers). Whereas metals, PAHs, and PCBs were rarely detected at sufficient concentrations to elicit a response, pyrethroid pesticides were highly correlated with amphipod toxicity. Summing individual pyrethroid constituents using a toxic unit approach suggested that toxicity to E. estuarius could be associated with pyrethroids. This unique test design allowed delineation of spatial and temporal differences in toxicity, suggesting that storm water discharge from Paleta Creek may be the source of seasonal toxicity.

AB The aquatic ecological environment is being threatened from overuse of pesticides, and the aquatic toxicity toward rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) plays a significant role in environmental risk assessment of agrochemicals. In the present study, 2 norm index formulas were developed, from which several norm descriptors were derived. A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model was established for the prediction of acute toxicity (median lethal concentration) toward rainbow trout of various pesticides. Results indicated that the present QSAR model presented an R-2 of 0.8053. Meanwhile, internal validation (Q(LOO)(2) = 0.7606), external validation (R-training(2) = 0.8011, R-testing(2) = 0.8108), Y-randomization test, and applicability domain analysis further demonstrated the stability, reliability, and wide application domain of the present QSAR model. Accordingly, these norm descriptors might be applicable to the structures of pesticides for predicting the acute toxicity to aquatic organism. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-7. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB The aim of the present study was to characterize the effects of particles on metal aquatic toxicity in a tropical system. To this end we investigated the effects of natural suspended solids on copper (Cu) geochemistry and acute toxicity to the cardinal tetra (Paracheirodon axelrodi) in 2 Amazonian rivers with different total suspended solids (TSS) levels: the Rio Negro (low TSS similar to 8 mg L-1) and the Rio Solimoes (high TSS similar to 70 mg L-1). The effect of particles on Cu aqueous geochemistry was assessed by measuring total dissolved and free ionic Cu concentrations in filtered (<0.45 mu m) and unfiltered waters. Furthermore acute Cu toxicity to fish was assessed in both filtered and unfiltered waters by measuring physiological net fluxes of Na+ Cl- K+ and total ammonia (in both river waters) and 96-h fish mortality (in Rio Solimoes only). The particles in the Rio Negro were not abundant enough to play a significant role in our study. On the other hand the Rio Solimoes particles bound approximately 70% of total aqueous Cu in our tests. In agreement with bioavailability-based models this decrease in dissolved (and free ionic) Cu concentration decreased Cu lethality in the 96-h toxicity tests. In the physiological measurements the best evidence of particle protection was the total alleviation of Cu-induced Cl- losses. These flux tests also suggested that the particles themselves may negatively affect Na+ balance in the fish. Overall the present study supports the use of bioavailability concepts to account for the role of natural suspended solids on metal biological effects in the Amazon River basin.

AB Microcystin-LR is a toxin commonly produced by the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. It is present in harmful algal blooms and is a concern for both human and environmental health in Canadian freshwater systems. Previous studies have investigated the toxicity of microcystin-LR to other organisms such as fish; however, it is important to assess its toxicity to native freshwater mussels (family Unionidae), which are considered imperiled. The present study examined the toxicity of microcystin-LR to fatmucket mussels (Lampsilis siliquoidea) at 2 different life stages. Juvenile mussels were exposed to microcystin-LR in a 28-d chronic test, and glochidia underwent a 72-h acute toxicity test. There was no significant relationship between glochidia viability and microcystin-LR concentration. The median lethal concentration (LC50) value for juvenile mussels after 28 d of exposure was 2.1 mu g/L. To determine the environmental relevance of the observed toxicity, an environmental exposure distribution was created using Canadian and Canadian-US Great Lakes microcystin measurements. The 28-d LC50 value (2.1 mu g/L) was greater than those values that occurred in the environment 95% of the time; however, the LC10 (0.45 mu g/L) and LC25 (0.97 mu g/L) values were not greater than the measured microcystin environmental values. This finding indicates that microcystins may exert toxic effects on juvenile mussels at environmentally relevant concentrations. Further investigation should be considered in terms of prolonged exposure to persistent microcystin-LR, and toxicity to sensitive species at different life stages.

AB The activities of selected biomarkers including 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase (ECOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were measured in the red algae (Gracilaria corticata) obtained from the Oman Sea. Chemical analyses were used to assess the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the red algae. Total PAH concentrations in the red algae ranged from 3.61 to 8.14 ng g(-1) dry weight. Mean GST and ECOD activity also varied from 8.87 to 15.32 nmol/mg protein/min and from 0.31 to 1.02 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Significant correlations were found between the total PAH levels and the selected biomarkers (p < 0.01). The results showed that ECOD and GST enzymes reacted to PAHs in phase I and II detoxification mechanisms of red algae (G. corticata), which extend the use of these biomarkers for investigation of the biological effects of PAH pollution as well as determination of pollution bioavailability.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous contaminants in aqueous environments. They affect cardiovascular development and function in fishes. The 3-ring PAH phenanthrene has recently been shown to impair cardiac excitation-contraction coupling by inhibiting Ca2+ and K+ currents in marine warm-water scombrid fishes. To see if similar events take place in a boreal freshwater fish, we studied whether the PAHs phenanthrene and retene (an alkylated phenanthrene) modify the action potential (AP) via effects on Na+ (I-Na), Ca2+ (I-CaL), or K+ (I-Kr, I-K1) currents in the ventricular myocytes of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) heart. Electrophysiological characteristics of myocytes were measured using whole-cell patch clamp. Micromolar concentrations of phenanthrene and retene modified the shape of the ventricular AP, and retene profoundly shortened the AP at low micromolar concentrations. Both PAHs increased I-Na and reduced I-CaL and I-Kr, but retene was more potent. Neither of the PAHs had an effect on I-K1. Our results show that phenanthrene and retene affect cardiac function in rainbow trout by a mechanism that involves multiple cardiac ion channels, and the final outcome of these changes (shortening of AP) is opposite to that observed in scombrid fishes (prolongation of AP). The results also show that retene and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist have an additional mechanism of toxicity besides the previously known AhR-mediated, transcription-dependent one.

AB An extension of the transformation/dissolution protocol (T/DP) was developed and evaluated as a tool to measure the removal of metals from the water column for chronic aquatic hazard classification. The T/DP extension (T/DP-E) consists of 2 parts: T/DP-E part 1, to measure metal removal from the water column via binding of metals to a substrate and subsequent settling, and T/DP-E part 2, to assess the potential for remobilization of metals following resuspension. The T/DP-E methodology (672-h [28-d] removal period, 1-h resuspension event, and 96-h resettling period) was tested using Cu, Co, and Sr solutions in the presence of a substrate. The metal removal rates varied from rapid removal for Cu to slower rates of removal for Co and Sr. The resuspension event did not trigger any increase in dissolved Cu, Co, or Sr. Additional 96-h experiments were conducted using dissolved Ni, Pb, Zn, and Ag and supported the conclusion that the T/DP-E is sufficiently robust to distinguish removal rates between metals with a wide range of reactivities. The proposed method provides a means to quantify the rate of metal removal from the water column and evaluate remobilization potential in a standardized and reliable way.

AB Plasma cholinesterase activity is a biomarker sensitive to the effect of organophosphate and carbamate pesticides, and its enzymatic levels have been previously unknown for most of the wild birds analyzed in the present study. Our objectives were to establish plasma acetylcholinesterase levels in songbirds of 2 undisturbed sites in the central Monte Desert (Argentina). We also examined the influence on cholinesterase activity of age, sex, body condition, feeding and migratory habits, and species. One hundred and sixty-five wild birds belonging to 26 species were studied. The values obtained for acetylcholinesterase activity provide a good estimate of the normal values in free-living individuals of the species Zonotrichia capensis, Molothrus bonariensis, Passer domesticus, Diuca diuca, Poospiza ornata, Saltator aurantiirostris, Gryseotyrannus aurantioatrocristatus, and Columbina picui, with interspecies differences. The median enzymatic levels +/- standard error of the mean ranged from 546.31 +/- 17.97 mu mol min(-1) L-1 in P. domesticus to 3439.90 +/- 173.92 mu mol min(-1) L-1 in Tyrannus melancholicus. No significant differences were detected between different sexes or ages. Birds that migrate (which are also insectivores) showed higher levels of cholinesterase than residents (mainly granivores). It is recommended that in cases of bird poisoning, plasma cholinesterase activity can be used as a diagnostic tool only if pre-exposure levels obtained in the same species are available, and ideally evaluated in individuals from the same biogeographical region.

AB Although the egg of aquatic insects is one of the main life stages that can be exposed to contaminants in water, little is known about the detailed impacts of contaminants on eggs of aquatic insects. The present study aimed to clarify the vulnerable embryonic stages of the caddisfly Cheumatopsyche brevilineata exposed to 2 insecticides, etofenprox and diflubenzuron, which are severely harmful to aquatic insects, and to assess the effects of exposure duration on toxicity of etofenprox to the embryonic stage. Eggs obtained from laboratory culture of the insect were exposed to etofenprox for different periods (2, 4, 6, or 8 d) and at different embryonic stages. In experiments with diflubenzuron, eggs were exposed for 2 d at different embryonic stages. These insecticides did not kill the embryos during exposure, but they inhibited hatching post exposure. Diflubenzuron also induced morphological abnormalities of hatchlings and reduced their survival. The overall median lethal concentration (LC50(overall)) values varied significantly from 0.0560 to 5.19 mu g/L for etofenprox among exposure durations and among embryonic stages, and from 0.442 to 2.89 mu g/L for diflubenzuron between embryonic stages. The toxicity of etofenprox to the embryo was more dependent on the embryonic stage at the time of exposure than on the exposure duration. The vulnerable embryonic stage differed between the insecticides. Etofenprox more strongly inhibited hatching of embryos at later stages, whereas sensitivity to diflubenzuron was higher in the following order: stages E3 to E7 > stages E1, E2, and E8. The different responses of C. brevilineata embryos may be attributable to differences in insecticide mode of action and in functional development of insecticide target sites during embryogenesis.

AB Agricultural and urban contaminants are an environmental concern because runoff may contaminate aquatic ecosystems, resulting in stress for exposed fish. The objective of the present controlled, field-based study was to assess the impacts of high-intensity agriculture and urban land use on multiple life stages of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), using the Maumee River (Toledo, OH, USA) as a case study. Laboratory cultured adult and larval fathead minnows were exposed for 21 d, and embryos were exposed until hatching to site-specific water along the lower reach of the Maumee River. Adult minnows were analyzed for reproduction and alterations to hematologic characteristics (vitellogenin, glucose, estradiol, 11-ketotestosterone). Water and fish tissue samples were analyzed for a suite of multiresidue pesticides, hormones, and pharmaceuticals. Contaminants were detected in every water and tissue sample, with 6 pesticides and 8 pharmaceuticals detected in at least 82% of water samples and at least half of tissue samples. Effects differed by exposed life stage and year of exposure. Fecundity was the most sensitive endpoint measured and was altered by water from multiple sites in both years. Physiological parameters associated with fecundity, such as plasma vitellogenin and steroid hormone concentrations, were seldom impacted. Larval fathead minnows appeared to be unaffected. Embryonic morphological development was delayed in embryos exposed to site waters collected in 2016 but not in 2017. A distinction between agricultural and urban influences in the Maumee River was not realized due to the great overlap in contaminant presence and biological effects. Differences in precipitation patterns between study years likely contributed to the observed biological differences and highlight the need for environmental exposure studies to assess the environmental risk of contaminants.

AB The gaseous fraction of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) in ambient air appears to be responsible for a significant portion of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated activity, but the majority of compounds contributing to this activity remain unidentified. The present study investigated the use of polyethylene passive samplers to isolate gaseous HOCs from ambient air for use in in vitro bioassays and to improve our understanding of the toxicological relevance of the gaseous fraction of ambient air in urban and residential environments. Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organic flame retardants were measured in polyethylene passive sampler extracts. Extracts were also analyzed using an in vitro bioassay to measure AhR-mediated activity. Bioassay-derived benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) equivalents (BaP-Eq(bio)), a measure of potency of HOC mixtures, were greatest in the downtown Cleveland area and lowest at rural/residential sites further from the city center. The BaP-Eq(bio) was weakly correlated with concentrations of 2-ring alkyl/substituted PAHs and one organophosphate flame retardant, ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate. Potency predicted based on literature-derived induction equivalency factors (IEFs) explained only 2 to 23% of the AhR-mediated potency observed in bioassay experiments. Our results suggests that health risks of gaseous ambient air pollution predicted using data from targeted chemical analysis may underestimate risks of exposure, most likely due to augmentation of potency by unmonitored chemicals in the mixture, and the lack of relevant IEFs for many targeted analytes.

AB The presence of reproductive endocrine-disrupting compounds (REDCs) in the environment poses a potential threat to fish and wildlife, because exposures are capable of altering sexual development, reproductive success, and behavior. Fish-based screening assays are often utilized to screen for the presence of REDCs in surface waters and to assess single chemicals for potential endocrine-disrupting activity. In an effort to improve such screening assays, the goal of the present study was to determine whether the gonadosomatic index (GSI) of female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), as assessed via external characteristics, influences their response to REDC exposure. Specifically, we sought to determine whether low-GSI females differed from high-GSI females in their responses to the model anti-estrogen fadrozole and the model androgen 17 beta-trenbolone, and whether there was a preferable classification in the context of REDC screening. Low-GSI females were more sensitive to fadrozole at the lower concentration of fadrozole (5 mu g/L) and to the higher concentration of trenbolone (50 ng/L), whereas high-GSI females were more sensitive at the lower concentration of trenbolone (5 ng/L). The differential response of low- and high-GSI females to REDCs indicates that GSI influences exposure outcome, and should subsequently be taken into consideration in the implementation of screening assays, as failure to utilize fish of the appropriate reproductive status may skew the test results.

AB It is recognized that the amount of natural dilution available can make a significant difference in the exposure and risk assessment of chemicals that emanate from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, data availability is a common limiting factor in exposure assessments for emerging markets. In the present study, we used a novel approach to derive dilution factors for the receiving waters within 5km of wastewater discharge points in Mexico by combining locally measured river volumes, ecoregion categorization, data on WWTP capacity, and global river network models. Distributions of wastewater effluent into receiving stream dilution factors were developed for the entire country and organized by ecoregion type to explore spatial differences. The distribution of dilution factors in Mexico ranged from >1000 in tropical and temperate ecoregions to 1 in desert ecoregions. To demonstrate its utility, dilution factors were used to develop a probabilistic model to explore the potential ecological risks of the high-volume surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), commonly used in down-the-drain cleaning products. The predicted LAS river exposure values were below the predicted no-effect concentration in all regions. The methodology developed for Mexico can be used to derive refined exposure assessments in other countries with emerging markets throughout the world, resulting in more realistic risk assessments.

AB Many studies show that neonicotinoid insecticides cause toxicity to aquatic invertebrates. Some studies report that insecticide toxicity may differ in combination with other agrochemicals under realistic field conditions. To explore such altered toxicity further, we aimed to determine the single and combined effects of environmentally relevant levels of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid and nutrients on different endpoints of 4 aquatic invertebrate species. Animals were exposed to these agrochemicals using a caged experiment within experimental ditches. We observed thiacloprid-induced toxicity for 2 crustaceans, Daphnia magna and Asellus aquaticus, and for 1 out of 2 tested insect species, Cloeon dipterum. We observed no toxic effects for Chironomus riparius at the time-weighted average test concentration of 0.51g thiacloprid/L. For D. magna, the observed toxicity, expressed as the lowest-observed-effect concentration (LOEC), on growth and reproduction was present at thiacloprid concentrations that were 2456-fold lower than laboratory-derived LOEC values. This shows that these species, when exposed under natural conditions, may exhibit neonicotinoid-induced toxic stress. Contrary to the low nutrient treatment, such toxicity was often not observed under nutrient-enriched conditions. This was likely attributable to the increased primary production that allowed for compensatory feeding. These findings warrant the inclusion of different feeding regimes in laboratory experiments to retrieve the best estimates of neonicotinoid-induced toxicity in the natural environment.

AB The embryotoxicity of extracts of American eels (Anguilla rostrata) was measured to determine whether maternally derived contaminants contribute to the declining recruitment of eels to Lake Ontario. Sexually maturing, large yellow and silver eels were sampled in 2007 and 2008 from 5 locations in eastern Canada, including Lake Ontario; positive controls included eels from the Hudson River, United States, and Canal Dessel-Schoten, Belgium (European eel, Anguilla anguilla). Japanese medaka eggs were injected immediately after fertilization with 1 or 10 nL of eel extract and, after 12 d, scored for signs of toxicity. Eel extracts did not cause dioxin-like embryotoxicity, reflecting the low concentrations of total dioxin equivalents measured chemically in these same extracts. Embryo mortality and reduced hatching success at high doses of eel extracts may reflect the bioaccumulation of legacy or emerging chemicals of concern. The results were consistent with long-term trends of declining concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in tissues of eels and other fish species from Lake Ontario, trends of declining embryotoxicity of eel tissue extracts, and recent increases of recruitment of juvenile eels to Lake Ontario. If dioxin-like compounds contributed in the past to the decline of recruitment and abundance of American eels in Lake Ontario, these data suggest that recruitment should recover, following the same trends as the recovery of lake trout reproduction in Lake Ontario.

AB High-throughput cell assays that detect and integrate the response of multiple chemicals acting via a common mode of action have the potential to enhance current environmental monitoring practices. Establishing the linkage between in vitro and in vivo responses is key to demonstrating that in vitro cell assays can be predictive of ecologically relevant outcomes. The present study investigated the potency of 17-estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), nonylphenol (NP), and treated wastewater effluent using the readily available GeneBLAzer((R)) estrogen receptor transactivation assay and 2 life stages of the inland silverside (Menidia beryllina). In vitro estrogenic potencies were ranked as follows: E2>E1>>NP. All 3 model estrogens induced vitellogenin and choriogenin expression in a dose-dependent manner in larvae and juveniles. However, apical effects were only found for E2 and E1 exposures of juveniles, which resulted in female-skewed sex ratios. Wastewater effluent samples exhibiting low in vitro estrogenicity (below the 10% effective concentration [EC10]), did not cause significant changes in M. beryllina. Significant induction of estrogen-responsive genes was observed at concentrations 6 to 26 times higher than in vitro responses. Gonadal feminization occurred at concentrations at least 19 to 26 times higher than the in vitro responses. These findings indicated that in vitro cell assays were more sensitive than the fish assays, making it possible to develop in vitro effect thresholds protective of aquatic organisms.

AB In 2013 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) test guideline (236) for fish embryo acute toxicity (FET) was adopted. It determines the acute toxicity of chemicals to embryonic fish. Previous studies show a good correlation of FET with the standard acute fish toxicity (AFT) test; however, the potential of the FET test to predict AFT, which is required by the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation (EC 1907/2006) and the Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation (EC 1272/2008), has not yet been fully clarified. In 2015 the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) requested that a consultant perform a scientific analysis of the applicability of FET to predict AFT. The purpose was to compare the toxicity of substances to fish embryos and to adult fish, and to investigate whether certain factors (e.g., physicochemical properties, modes of action, or chemical structures) could be used to define the applicability boundaries of the FET test. Given the limited data availability, the analysis focused on organic substances. The present critical review summarizes the main findings and discusses regulatory application of the FET test under REACH. Given some limitations (e.g., neurotoxic mode of action) and/or remaining uncertainties (e.g., deviation of some narcotic substances), it has been found that the FET test alone is currently not sufficient to meet the essential information on AFT as required by the REACH regulation. However, the test may be used within weight-of-evidence approaches together with other independent, relevant, and reliable sources of information. The present review also discusses further research needs that may overcome the remaining uncertainties and help to increase acceptance of FET as a replacement for AFT in the future. For example, an increase in the availability of data generated according to OECD test guideline 236 may provide evidence of a higher predictive power of the test.

AB In the present study 42 polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) were investigated for their estrogenic potential using the VM7Luc4E2 transactivation assay. Relative potencies were determined for mass-balance analysis. In addition, compounds were tested in combination with the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist vertical bar C vertical bar 182,780 (vertical bar C vertical bar) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonist/CYP1A1 inhibitor a-naphthoflavone. Luciferase induction and CYP1A1-dependent ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity were measured to assess whether the estrogenic activity was elicited by the compound itself and/or by its metabolites. Relative potencies ranged between 10(-7) and 10(-4). The ability of ICI to decrease luciferase activity stimulated by all compounds indicated that the induction responses were ER-dependent. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonist/CYP1A1 inhibitor a-naphthoflavone decreased luciferase induction and EROD activity by several compounds, including the methylated chrysenes, suggesting that metabolites of these chemicals contributed to ER activation. Several PACs, such as acridine and its derivatives, appear to directly activate the ER. Furthermore, extracts of soils from industrial areas were examined using this bioassay, and estrogenic activity was detected in all soil samples. Mass-balance analysis using a combination of relative potencies and chemical analysis of the samples suggested that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and alkylated PAHs, such as 1-and 3-methylchrysene, are important contributors to the overall estrogenic activity. However, these results revealed that a considerable proportion of the estrogenic activity in the soil remained unexplained, indicating the presence of other significant estrogenic compounds.

AB Mercury (Hg) is a highly toxic metal that has detrimental effects on wildlife. We surveyed Hg concentrations in 10 species of bats collected at wind farms in the central United States and found contamination in all species. Mercury concentration in fur was highly variable both within and between species (range: 1.08-10.52 mu g/g). Despite the distance between sites (up to 1200 km), only 2 of the 5 species sampled at multiple locations had fur Hg concentrations that differed between sites. Mercury concentrations observed in the present study all fell within the previously reported ranges for bats collected from the northeastern United States and Canada, although many of the bats we sampled had lower maximum Hg concentrations. Juvenile bats had lower concentrations of Hg in fur compared with adult bats, and we found no significant effect of sex on Hg concentrations in fur. For a subset of 2 species, we also measured Hg concentration in muscle tissue; concentrations were much higher in fur than in muscle, and Hg concentrations in the 2 tissue types were weakly correlated. Abundant wind farms and ongoing postconstruction fatality surveys offer an underutilized opportunity to obtain tissue samples that can be used to assess Hg contamination in bats. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is reviewing the protectiveness of the national ambient water quality criteria (WQC) for aluminum (Al) and compiling a toxicity data set to update the WQC. Freshwater mussels are one of the most imperiled groups of animals in the world, but little is known about their sensitivity to Al. The objective of the present study was to evaluate acute 96-h and chronic 28-d toxicity of Al to a unionid mussel (Lampsilis siliquoidea) and a commonly tested amphipod (Hyalella azteca) at a pH of 6 and water hardness of 100 mg/L as CaCO3. The acute 50% effect concentration (EC50) for survival of both species was >6200 mu g total Al/L. The EC50 was greater than all acute values in the USEPA acute Al data set for freshwater species at a pH range of 5.0 to <6.5 and hardness normalized to 100 mg/L, indicating that the mussel and amphipod were insensitive to Al in acute exposures. The chronic 20% effect concentration (EC20) based on dry weight was 163 mg total Al/L for the mussel and 409 mu g total Al/L for the amphipod. Addition of the EC20s to the USEPA chronic Al data set for pH 5.0 to <6.5 would rank the mussel (L. siliquoidea) as the fourth most sensitive species and the amphipod (H. azteca) as the fifth most sensitive species, indicating the 2 species were sensitive to Al in chronic exposures. The USEPA-proposed acute and chronic WQC for Al would adequately protect the mussel and amphipod tested; however, inclusion of the chronic data from the present study and recalculation of the chronic criterion would likely lower the proposed chronic criterion.

AB Studies of endocrine-disrupting contaminants have focused on early-life exposures, but later exposures could impact fitness. We exposed adult frogs (Acris blanchardi) at reproduction to ecologically relevant atrazine concentrations (0, 1, or 10 mu g/L) in outdoor arenas. We measured likelihood of breeding and number of resulting tadpoles. Atrazine impacted neither the probability of breeding nor the number of tadpoles produced, suggesting anuran reproductive success may not be impacted by short-term exposure to low concentrations.

AB Inflation of the posterior and/or anterior swim bladder is a process previously demonstrated to be regulated by thyroid hormones. We investigated whether inhibition of deiodinases, which convert thyroxine (T4) to the more biologically active form, 3,5,3-triiodothyronine (T3), would impact swim bladder inflation. Two experiments were conducted using a model deiodinase inhibitor, iopanoic acid (IOP). First, fathead minnow embryos were exposed to 0.6, 1.9, or 6.0mg/L or control water until 6 d postfertilization (dpf), at which time posterior swim bladder inflation was assessed. To examine anterior swim bladder inflation, a second study was conducted with 6-dpf larvae exposed to the same IOP concentrations until 21 dpf. Fish from both studies were sampled for T4/T3 measurements and gene transcription analyses. Incidence and length of inflated posterior swim bladders were significantly reduced in the 6.0mg/L treatment at 6 dpf. Incidence of inflation and length of anterior swim bladder were significantly reduced in all IOP treatments at 14 dpf, but inflation recovered by 18 dpf. Throughout the larval study, whole-body T4 concentrations increased and T3 concentrations decreased in all IOP treatments. Consistent with hypothesized compensatory responses, deiodinase-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was up-regulated in the larval study, and thyroperoxidase mRNA was down-regulated in all IOP treatments in both studies. These results support the hypothesized adverse outcome pathways linking inhibition of deiodinase activity to impaired swim bladder inflation. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:2942-2952.

AB Thiamethoxam is a neonicotinoid insecticide used widely in agriculture to control a broad spectrum of chewing and sucking insect pests. Recent detection of thiamethoxam in surface waters has raised interest in characterizing the potential impacts of this insecticide to aquatic organisms. We report the results of toxicity testing (acute and chronic) conducted under good laboratory practices for more than 30 freshwater species (insects, molluscs, crustaceans, algae, macrophytes, and fish) and 4 marine species (an alga, a mollusc, a crustacean, and a fish). As would be anticipated for a neonicotinoid, aquatic primary producers and fish were the least sensitive organisms tested, with acute median lethal and effect concentrations (LC50/EC50) observed to be >= 80 mg/L in all cases, which far exceeds surface water exposure concentrations. Tested molluscs, worms, and rotifers were similarly insensitive (EC50 >= 100 mg/L), except for Lumbriculus sp., with an EC50 of 7.7 mg/L. In general, insects were the most sensitive group in the study, with most acute EC50 values < 1 mg/L. However, the crustaceans Asellus aquaticus and Ostracoda exhibited a sensitivity similar to that of insects (acute EC50 < 1 mg/L), and the midge larvae Chaoborus sp. were relatively insensitive compared with other insects (EC50 > 5.5 mg/L). The most sensitive chronic response was for Chironomus riparius, with a 30-d no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC; emergence) of 0.01 mg/L. Observed toxicity to the tested marine organisms was comparable to that of freshwater species. We used the reported data to construct species sensitivity distributions for thiamethoxam, to calculate 5% hazard concentrations (HC5s) for acute data (freshwater invertebrates), and compared these with measured concentrations from relevant North American surface waters. Overall, based on acute toxicity endpoints, the potential acute risk to freshwater organisms was found to be minimal (likelihood of exceeding HC5s < 1%). (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB Pseudoreplication is a widely discussed topic in the scientific community. Its principal critique concerns the lack of independence in flawed experimental designs and the use of inferential statistics to test the hypothesis of such experiments. Thirty years after its appearance, it remains misunderstood by many researchers, including ecotoxicologists. In the present study, we try to clarify some of its concepts by filling in what seems to be a gap in the terminology of manipulative experiments. We propose the term "experimental medium" to refer strictly to the relevant spatial scale of the experiment to preserve the specificity of the experimental and observational units and to display pseudoreplication as a kind of misinterpretation and/or misanalysis of inferential statistics. A classification of the types of experimental designs in ecotoxicology is offered, and the problems in using inferential statistics in suboptimal designs are discussed. We hope to shed some light on such a classic topic for ecotoxicologists. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB It is virtually impossible to reliably assess water quality with target chemical analyses only. Therefore, a complementary effect-based risk assessment by bioanalyses on mixtures of bioavailable micropollutants is proposed: the Smart Integrated Monitoring (SIMONI) strategy. The goal of this strategy is to obtain more reliable information on the water quality to select optimum measures for improvement. The SIMONI strategy is 2-tiered. Tier 1 is a bioanalytical hazard identification of sites. A tier 2 ecological risk assessment is carried out only at a limited number of sites where increased hazards are detected in tier 1. Tier 2 will be customized, based on tier 1 evaluation and additional knowledge of the aquatic system. The present study focuses on the tier 1 bioanalytical hazard identification to distinguish "hot spots" of chemical pollution. First, a selection was made of relevant and cost-effective bioanalytical endpoints to cover a wide spectrum of micropollutant modes of action. Specific endpoints may indicate which classes of chemicals might cause adverse effects. Second, effect-based trigger values (EBT) were derived for these bioassays to indicate potential ecological risks. Comparison of EBT with bioassay responses should discriminate sites exhibiting different chemical hazards. Third, a model was designed to estimate the overall risks for aquatic ecosystems. The associated follow-up for risk management is a "toxicity traffic light" system: green, low hazard (no action required); orange, potential risk (further research needed); and red, high risk (mitigation measures). Thanks to cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and relevance, the SIMONI strategy has the potential to become the first bioanalytical tool to be applied in regular water quality monitoring programs.

AB Crude oils are composed of an assortment of hydrocarbons, some of which are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are of particular interest due to their narcotic and potential phototoxic effects. Several studies have examined the phototoxicity of individual PAHs and fresh and weathered crude oils, and several models have been developed to predict PAH toxicity. Fingerprint analyses of oils have shown that PAHs in crude oils are predominantly alkylated. However, current models for estimating PAH phototoxicity assume toxic equivalence between unsubstituted (i.e., parent) and alkyl-substituted compounds. This approach may be incorrect if substantial differences in toxic potency exist between unsubstituted and substituted PAHs. The objective of the present study was to examine the narcotic and photo-enhanced toxicity of commercially available unsubstituted and alkylated PAHs to mysid shrimp (Americamysis bahia). Data were used to validate predictive models of phototoxicity based on the highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gap approach and to develop relative effect potencies. Results demonstrated that photo-enhanced toxicity increased with increasing methylation and that phototoxic PAH potencies vary significantly among unsubstituted compounds. Overall, predictive models based on the HOMO-LUMO gap were relatively accurate in predicting phototoxicity for unsubstituted PAHs but are limited to qualitative assessments. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Urban sewage is a concerning issue worldwide, threatening both wildlife and human health. The present study investigated protein oxidation in mangrove oysters (Crassostrea brasiliana) exposed to seawater from Balneario Camboriu, an important tourist destination in Brazil that is affected by urban sewage. Oysters were exposed for 24 h to seawater collected close to the Camboriu River (CAM1) or 1 km away (CAM2). Seawater from an aquaculture laboratory was used as a reference. Local sewage input was marked by higher levels of coliforms, nitrogen, and phosphorus in seawater, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), linear alkylbenzenes (LABs), and fecal steroid in sediments at CAM1. Exposure of oysters to CAM1 causedmarked bioaccumulation of LABs and decreased PAH and PCB concentrations after exposure to both CAM1 and CAM2. Protein thiol oxidation in gills, digestive gland, and hemolymph was evaluated. Lower levels of reduced protein thiols were detected in hemolymph from CAM1, and actin, segon, and domininwere identified as targets of protein thiol oxidation. Dominin susceptibility to oxidationwas confirmed in vitro by exposure to peroxides and hypochlorous acid, and 2 cysteine residues were identified as potential sites of oxidation. Overall, these data indicate that urban sewage contamination in local waters has a toxic potential and that protein thiol oxidation in hemolymph could be a useful biomarker of oxidative stress in bivalves exposed to contaminants.

AB The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 overlapped with the spawning of many pelagic fish species in the Gulf of Mexico, including mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) released during the spill have been shown to cause photo-induced toxicity under ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In the present study, mahi-mahi embryos were exposed to high-energy water accommodated fractions of source and naturally weathered oils for up to 48 h. The timing of co-exposure with UV radiation varied between an early development exposure for 8 h or a late development exposure for 8 h. The UV co-exposure had a photo-induced toxic effect on hatching success for all oil types and exposure scenarios. A more sensitive developmental window to photo-induced toxicity was observed when UV exposure occurred late in development. Source Oil B was over 6-fold more toxic, and Massachusetts source oil was 1.6-fold more toxic when the embryos were co-exposed toUVlight late in development. Furthermore, weathered oil from the surface co-exposure with UV late in development resulted in bradycardia in the mahi-mahi. The present study provides evidence that the developmental window when UV co-exposure occurs has a significant effect on the degree of photo-induced toxicity of oil and that UV co-exposure may exacerbate long-term cardiac effects in developing fish.

AB The principal response curve (PRC) method is a constrained ordination method developed specifically for the analysis of community data collected in mesocosm experiments, which provides easily understood summaries and graphical representations of community response to stress. It is a redundancy analysis method and is usually performed on log-transformed abundance data. The choice of a measure of dissimilarity between samples and the choice of the data transformation significantly affect the results of multivariate analysis. Dissimilarity measures that are more ecologically meaningful than the Euclidean distance can be incorporated into the PRC using distance-based redundancy analysis. The present study investigates the ordinations produced by a small selection of dissimilarity measures: the Euclidean distance using log-transformed and Hellinger-transformed data and the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity using raw and log-transformed data. It compares 2 data sets from experiments on the effect of the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac and the insecticide chlorpyrifos on macroinvertebrate communities. The choice of dissimilarity measure can determine the outcome of a risk assessment. For the diclofenac data set, the PRCs were different depending on the dissimilarity measure: the community no-effect concentration was lowest for the Bray-Curtis on log-transformed data and Hellinger dissimilarity measures. For chlorpyrifos, however, the PRCs were similar for all dissimilarity measures. Environ (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The effects of 2 currently used commercial pesticide formulations on Pacific sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), from fertilization to emergence, were evaluated in a gravel-bed flume incubator that simulated a natural streambed. Embryos were exposed to atrazine at 25 mg/L (low atrazine) or atrazine at 250 mg/L (high atrazine) active ingredient (a.i.), and chlorothalonil at 0.5 mu g/L (low chlorothalonil) or chlorothalonil at 5 mg/L a. i. (high chlorothalonil) and examined for effects on developmental success and timing, as well as physical and biochemical growth parameters. Survival to hatch was reduced in the high chlorothalonil group (55% compared with 83% in controls), accompanied by a 24% increase in finfold deformity incidence. Reduced alevin condition factor (2.9-5.4%) at emergence and elevated triglyceride levels were seen in chlorothalonil-exposed fish. Atrazine exposure caused premature hatch (average high atrazine time to 50% hatch [H50] = 100 d postfertilization [dpf]), and chlorothalonil exposure caused delayed hatch (high chlorothalonil H50 = 108 dpf; controls H50 = 102 dpf). All treatments caused premature emergence (average time to 50% emergence [E50]: control E50 = 181 dpf, low chlorothalonil E50 = 175 dpf, high chlorothalonil E50 = 174 dpf, high atrazine E50 = 175 dpf, low atrazine E50 = 174 dpf), highlighting the importance of using a gravel-bed incubator to examine this subtle, but critical endpoint. These alterations indicate that atrazine and chlorothalonil could affect survival of early life stages of sockeye salmon in the wild. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes (delta N-15, delta C-13) are commonly used to understand mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation and biomagnification in freshwater food webs. Though sulfur isotopes (delta S-34) can distinguish between energy sources from the water column (aqueous sulfate) and from sediments to freshwater organisms, little is known about whether delta S-34 can help interpret variable Hg concentrations in aquatic species or food webs. Seven acidic lakes in Kejimkujik National Park (Nova Scotia, Canada) were sampled for biota, water, and sediments in 2009 and 2010. Fishes, zooplankton, and macroinvertebrates were analyzed for delta S-34, delta N-15, delta C-13, and Hg (methyl Hg in invertebrates, total Hg in fishes); aqueous sulfate and profundal sediments were analyzed for delta S-34. Within lakes, mean delta S-34 values in sediments and sulfate differed between 0.53% and 1.98%, limiting their use as tracers of energy sources to the food webs. However, log-Hg and delta S-34 values were negatively related (slopes -0.14 to -0.35, R-2 0.20-0.39, p < 0.001-0.01) through each food web, and slopes were significantly different among lakes (analysis of covariance, lake x delta S-34 interaction term p = 0.04). Despite these relationships, multiple regression analyses within each taxon showed that biotic Hg concentrations were generally better predicted by delta N-15 and/or delta C-13. The results indicate that delta S-34 values are predictive of Hg concentrations in these food webs, although the mechanisms underlying these relationships warrant further study. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Monitoring the quality of freshwater is an important issue for public health. In the context of the European project mu Aqua, 150 samples were collected from several waters in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Turkey for 2 yr. These samples were analyzed using 2 multitoxin detection methods previously developed: a microsphere-based method coupled to flow-cytometry, and an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method. The presence of microcystins, nodularin, domoic acid, cylindrospermopsin, and several analogues of anatoxin-a (ATX-a) was monitored. No traces of cylindrospermopsin or domoic acid were found in any of the environmental samples. Microcystin-LR and microcystin-RR were detected in 2 samples from Turkey and Germany. In the case of ATX-a derivatives, 75% of samples contained mainly H-2-ATX-a and small amounts of H-2-homoanatoxin-a, whereas ATX-a and homoanatoxin-a were found in only 1 sample. These results confirm the presence and wide distribution of dihydro derivatives of ATX-a toxins in European freshwaters. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Prior studies (2006-2016) in birds of prey admitted to a wildlife clinic in Massachusetts, USA, revealed widespread exposure to second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) among red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis, RTHAs). Continued monitoring of species for which historic data are available can reveal trends in exposure that aid in evaluating the effectiveness of risk-mitigation measures. While the majority of exposure-monitoring studies utilize liver tissue collected postmortem, antemortem modalities, such as serum analysis, may be desirable for risk assessments in certain populations. However, the sensitivity of serum for detecting anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) is not well studied. Paired liver and serum samples from 43 RTHAs were evaluated from 2017 to 2019. In liver tissue, 100% of birds were positive for ARs, with the SGARs brodifacoum, bromadiolone, and difethialone identified most frequently; 91% of birds had liver residues of 2 to 4 ARs. These findings represent the highest exposure both to ARs overall and to multiple ARs in RTHAs compared to previous studies. All birds diagnosed with AR toxicosis (n = 14) were positive for ARs in serum; however, all subclinically exposed birds (n = 29) were negative in serum. These data show that exposure to SGARs remains widespread in RTHAs in this geographic area. In addition, although serum analysis is not sensitive for detecting sublethal exposures in RTHAs, it can potentially support a diagnosis of AR toxicosis in conjunction with other consistent signs.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-11.

AB Although the introduction of non-native fish species has been shown to alter trophic ecology in aquatic ecosystems, there has been limited research on how invasive species alter methylmercury (MeHg) biomagnification in lacustrine food webs. We sampled surface water and biota from 8 lakes in Quebec, Canada, spanning a range of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (2.9-8.4 mg/L); 4 lakes were inhabited by native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and the remaining lakes contained brook trout and a non-native fish, Allegheny pearl dace (Margariscus margarita). Periphyton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fish were analyzed for: 1) stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope ratios to delineate food webs, and 2) total Hg (THg) or MeHg. Compared with the brook trout from reference lakes, fish from invaded lakes had higher length-standardized THg concentrations as well as a narrower dietary range and elevated trophic level, inferred from unadjusted delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, respectively. The rate of Hg biomagnification was similar across invaded and reference lakes, implying little effect of the invasive fish on the trophic transfer of MeHg. Despite differences in food web structure due to pearl dace invasion, DOC was the strongest predictor of brook trout THg levels for all lakes, suggesting that underlying environmental factors exerted a stronger influence on brook trout THg concentrations than the presence of a non-native forage fish.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-12.

AB Effects-directed analysis (EDA) is an important tool for identifying unknown bioactive components in a complex mixture. Such an analysis of endocrine-active chemicals (EACs) from water sources has promising regulatory implications but also unique logistical challenges. We propose a conceptual EDA (framework) based on a critical review of EDA literature and concentrations of common EACs in waste and surface waters. Required water volumes for identification of EACs under this EDA framework were estimated based on bioassay performance (in vitro and in vivo bioassays), limits of quantification by mass spectrometry (MS), and EAC water concentrations. Sample volumes for EDA across the EACs showed high variation in the bioassay detectors, with genistein, bisphenol A, and androstenedione requiring very high sample volumes and ethinylestradiol and 17 beta-trenbolone requiring low sample volumes. Sample volume based on the MS detector was far less variable across the EACs. The EDA framework equation was rearranged to calculate detector "thresholds," and these thresholds were compared with the literature EAC water concentrations to evaluate the feasibility of the EDA framework. In the majority of instances, feasibility of the EDA was limited by the bioassay, not MS detection. Mixed model analysis showed that the volumes required for a successful EDA were affected by the potentially responsible EAC, detection methods, and the water source type, with detection method having the greatest effect on the EDA of estrogens and androgens. The EDA framework, equation, and model we present provide a valuable tool for designing a successful EDA.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-16. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Blooms of toxin-producing cyanobacteria have been more frequent and lasting because of the eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems, including those used for aquaculture. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of chronic exposure to a saxitoxin-producing strain of Raphidiopsis (Cylindrospermopsis) raciborskii on the performance of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fingerlings over a 60-d period. The fingerlings were cultivated under the following conditions: 1) water without cyanobacterium (WATER), 2) R. raciborskii in ASM-1 culture medium (CYANO), and 3) ASM-1 culture medium without cyanobacterium (ASM). Exposure to the CYANO treatment led to a significant increase in the mortality rate (p < 0.05) and a significant reduction in growth (p < 0.05) compared to fingerlings submitted to the ASM and WATER treatments, in which similar survival and growth were found (p > 0.05). Saxitoxin toxicity was dependent on the weight of the fingerling (p < 0.05), with maximum mortality caused by the ingestion of 13.66 mu g saxitoxin equivalent L-1 g(-1). The present results clearly show the harm caused by saxitoxins to the production of Nile tilapia fingerlings in the early growth phase. These findings underscore the importance of maintaining adequate water quality in aquaculture activities to minimize the risk of saxitoxin-producing cyanobacterial blooms and avoid economic losses among producers.

AB We describe a simple single-pot method for collection and preparation of natural water for microplastic analyses. The method prepares samples in the same vessel (mason jars) that they are collected in right up until the microplastics are transferred onto filters or spectroscopic windows for analyses. The method minimized contamination, degradation, and losses, while increasing recoveries and throughput when compared with conventional sieving. We applied it to surface grab samples collected from the Mississippi River and its major tributaries during and after historic flooding in 2019. Microplastics (>similar to 30 mu m) were quantified using Nile red fluorescence detection, and a small subset of samples were identified by micro-Fourier transform infrared imaging spectroscopy. Concentrations were lower during the flooding, likely due to dilution. Concentrations ranged from approximately 14 microplastics/L in the Tennessee River during flooding to approximately 83 microplastics/L in the Ohio River during low-flow (summer) conditions. Loads of microplastics tended to increase downriver and ranged from approximately 87 to approximately 129 trillion microplastics/d near New Orleans. Most of the microplastics (>60%) were in the lower size fraction (similar to 30-90 mu m) and consisted primarily of fragments (similar to 85%), followed by fibers (similar to 8%) and beads (similar to 7%), with polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyacrylate as the primary microplastic types. Overall, we demonstrate that the single-pot method is effective and versatile and, because it uses relatively inexpensive and easily assembled materials, can be adapted for microplastic surveys worldwide, especially those involving sample collection by volunteers from the community and schools.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Since 2009, the Canadian and Alberta governments have been developing monitoring plans for surface water quality and quantity of the lower Athabasca River and its tributaries (2010-2013). The objectives of the present study to the fish monitoring program were to 1) assess the current status of fish in a tributary of the lower Athabasca River, 2) identify existing differences between upstream reference and within the oil sands deposit exposure sites, and 3) identify trends/changes in fish performance indicators relative to historical studies. The present study examines the fish performance indicators in slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) in the Steepbank River, Alberta, in terms of growth, gonad size, condition, and hepatic 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity as an indicator of exposure to oil-sands-related compounds. The sampling program followed historical sampling methods (1999-2000) to provide comparable data over time with an additional upstream site (n = 2) added as development progressed. Consistent changes were documented in sculpin collected from downstream sections of the Steepbank River within the oil sands deposit (n = 2) in 2010 through 2013. Sculpin demonstrated increased liver size with corresponding induction of EROD activity consistent with historical data and reductions in energy investment relative to reproductive development and gonadal steroid production capacity. There was no consistent evidence of changes in fish performance indicators with increased surface mining development, particularly adjacent to the Steepbank River Mid site. Although physical development in the Steepbank watershed has increased over the last 15 yr, these results are consistent with historical data suggesting that the magnitude of the response in the aquatic environment adjacent to the development has not changed.

AB Tangshan city in Hebei Province is one of the most heavily polluted cities in China, with substantial industrial emissions. The development of effective air pollution emission reduction policies requires knowledge of the sources and health risks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-enriched fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We investigated the seasonal variation and source apportionment of 16 priority PAH-enriched PM2.5 samples in Tangshan during 2014 and 2015, and we assessed the health risks associated with inhalation exposure to PAHs. The PM2.5 samples were collected from April 2014 to February 2015. We analyzed the concentrations of PM2.5 and PAH-enriched PM2.5, and used principal component analysis and molecular diagnostic ratios to identify potential sources. We explored the relationship between distribution and meteorological conditions, and used an incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) model to quantitatively evaluate exposure from the inhalation risk of PAHs. The average mass concentration of PM2.5 was 196 mu g/m(3), with a range 34.0 to 586 mu g/m(3). The median n-ary sumation (16)PAH values in PM2.5 were 190 ng/m(3), with a range of 60.2 to 862 ng/m(3) over the sampling period. The order of n-ary sumation (16)PAHs concentration was winter > autumn > summer > spring. The results show that the primary sources of PAH-enriched PM2.5 are coal combustion, vehicle exhaust, and biomass burning. The annual mean of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) was 8.37 ng/m(3), more than 8-fold greater than the BaP annual standard (1 ng/m(3)) set by the Chinese State Environmental Protection Agency. The ILCR values for 3 groups (children, teenagers, and adults) over the 4 seasons were between 10(-6) and 10(-4), indicating a potential health risk from PAHs in Tangshan.

AB Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are psychoactive pharmaceuticals that have been detected intact in natural waters globally. Laboratory experiments have reported that several SSRIs inhibit fish foraging behavior, but data for the SSRI escitalopram are lacking. The objectives of the present study were to determine whether escitalopram affects feeding behavior in zebrafish and whether possible sex differences exist. We exposed female and male zebrafish (Danio rerio) to 0.00, 0.10, and 1.50 mu g/L of escitalopram in flow-through tanks for a 3-wk exposure period. We used a video tracking system with high temporal and spatial resolution to collect data on zebrafish swimming patterns in test tanks containing a food source. The results show a more pronounced effect of escitalopram in males compared with females. At the assumed most environmentally relevant concentration (0.10 mu g/L), male average feeding time/visit and maximum feeding duration were significantly reduced by 27 and 42%, respectively. In addition, male total feeding duration was also significantly reduced (by 73%) at the highest concentration (1.50 mu g/L). In females, only the maximum feeding duration was significantly reduced (by 41%) in the 0.10 mu g/L treatment group. Hence, we reject our initial hypothesis that female feeding behavior is more vulnerable to escitalopram. There was no effect of escitalopram on length or weight among the experimental groups. The present study demonstrates that escitalopram, like other SSRIs, can inhibit fish foraging behavior and therefore potentially disturb natural food chains. Finally, our study suggests that SSRIs can both be sex and behavior specific. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019:1-9. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Application factors are routinely applied in the extrapolation of laboratory aquatic toxicity data to ensure protection from exposure to chemicals in the natural environment. The magnitude of the application factor is both a scientific and a policy decision, but in any case, it should be rooted in scientific knowledge so as to not be arbitrary. Information-rich chemicals are often subjected to species sensitivity distribution (SSD) analysis to transparently describe certain aspects of assessment uncertainty and are normally subjected to much smaller application factors than screening information data sets. We describe a new set of tools useful to assess the quality of SSDs. Twenty-two data sets and 19 chemicals representing agrochemicals, biocides, surfactants, metals, and common wastewater contaminants were compiled to demonstrate how the tools can be used. "Add-one-in" and "leave-one-out" simulations were used to investigate SSD robustness and develop quantitative evidence for the use of application factors. Theoretical new toxicity data were identified for add-one-in simulations based on the expected probabilities necessary to lower the hazardous concentration to 5% of a species (HC5) by a factor of 2, 3, 5, or 10. Simulations demonstrate the basis for application factors in the range of 1 to 5 for well-studied chemicals with high-quality SSDs. Leave-one-out simulations identify the fact that the most influential values in the SSD come from the extremes of the sensitive and tolerant toxicity values. Mesocosm and field data consistently demonstrate that HC5s are conservative, further justifying the use of small application factors for high-quality SSDs. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1526-1541.

AB There are limited acute toxicity test methods for native North American marine species that are considered zooplankton for their entire life cycle. Examples of standardized marine zooplankton methods include mussel, bivalve, and echinoderm development tests that use a relatively short-lived planktonic larval stage, chronic life-cycle toxicity tests using epibenthic copepods, and a 24-h Acartia tonsa copepod test method. The objectives of the present study were to: 1) develop and evaluate a novel, 48-h acute toxicity test method using the marine North American copepod Pseudodiaptomus pelagicus that is planktonic for its entire life cycle, and 2) determine the sensitivity of P. pelagicus relative to commonly tested marine toxicity test species. The average (+/- 1 standard deviation) median lethal concentrations (LC50s) for copper (Cu), phenanthrene, and un-ionized ammonia were 32 +/- 15 mu g/L, 161 +/- 51 mu g/L, and 1.08 +/- 0.30 mg NH3/L, respectively. These results placed P. pelagicus on the more sensitive end of Cu and phenanthrene species sensitivity distributions. The copepod was less sensitive to un-ionized ammonia than commonly tested marine species. This finding suggests that the acute P. pelagicus test method will allow a focus on assessing the impacts of persistent contaminants of concern with less confounding impact from naturally occurring ammonia released to the water from sources such as suspended sediments.

AB Graphene is a 2-dimensional nanomaterial with unique mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties. With increasing applications of graphene-family nanomaterials (GFNs) in electronics, biomedicine, and surface coatings, concern for their impacts on aquatic ecosystems is rising. Current information on the toxicity of GFNs, including graphene oxide, is scarce. Filter-feeding bivalves, such as eastern oysters, are good models for nanomaterial exposure studies. We present results from a 72-h static renewal oyster study using 1 and 10 mg/L graphene oxide, which, to our knowledge, is the first report on in vivo effects of graphene oxide exposures in marine bivalves. Water samples were analyzed for graphene oxide concentration and size assessments. Gill and digestive gland tissues were evaluated for lipid peroxidation and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity. In addition, gill sections were fixed for histopathological analyses. Elevated lipid peroxidation was noted in oysters exposed to 10 mg/L graphene oxide. No significant changes in GST activity were observed, but reduced total protein levels were found in digestive gland tissues of exposed oysters at both concentrations. Loss of mucous cells, hemocytic infiltration, and vacuolation were observed in gills of exposed oysters. The results indicate that short-term graphene oxide exposures can induce oxidative stress and epithelial inflammation and adversely affect overall oyster health. Further investigations regarding the fate and sublethal effects of graphene oxide are critical to understanding the risks associated with a rapidly growing graphene consumer market.

AB Discerning potential effects of insecticides on honey bee colonies in field studies conducted under realistic conditions can be challenging because of concurrent interactions with other environmental conditions. Honey bee colony models can control exposures and other environmental factors, as well as assess links among pollen and nectar residues in the landscape, their influx into the colony, and the resulting exposures and effects on bees at different developmental stages. We extended the colony model BEEHAVE to represent exposure to the insecticide clothianidin via residues in pollen from treated cornfields set in real agricultural landscapes in the US Midwest. We assessed their potential risks to honey bee colonies over a 1-yr cycle. Clothianidin effects on colony strength were only observed if unrealistically high residue levels in the pollen were simulated. The landscape composition significantly impacted the collection of pollen (residue exposure) from the cornfields, resulting in higher colony-level effects in landscapes with lower proportions of semi-natural land. The application of the extended BEEHAVE model with a pollen exposure-effects module provides a case study for the application of a mechanistic honey bee colony model in pesticide risk assessment integrating the impact of a range of landscape compositions.

AB Control charting is a simple technique to identify change and is well suited for use in water quality programs. Control charts accounting for covariation associated with discharge and in some cases time were used to explore example and representative variables routinely measured in the Athabasca River near the oil sands area for indications of change. The explored variables include 5 major ions (chloride, sodium, sulfate, calcium, magnesium), 5 total metals (aluminum, iron, thallium, molybdenum, vanadium), and total suspended solids at two sites straddling the developments north of Fort McMurray. Regression equations developed from reference data (1988-2009) were used to predict observations and calculate residuals from later test data (2010-2016). Evidence of change was sought in the deviation of residual errors from the test period compared with the patterns expected and defined from probability distributions of the reference residuals using the odds ratio. In most cases, the patterns in test residuals were not statistically different from those expected from the reference period at either site, especially when data were examined annually. However, differences were found at both locations, more were found at the downstream site, and more differences emerged as data accumulated and were analyzed over time. In sum, the analyses at the downstream site suggest higher concentrations than predicted in most major ions, but the source of the changes is uncertain. In contrast, the concentrations of most metals at during the test period were lower than expected, which may be related to deposition patterns of materials or weathering of minerals during construction activities of the 2000s which influence the reference data used. The analyses also suggest alternative approaches may be necessary to understand change in some variables. Despite this, the results support the use of control charts to detect changes in water chemistry parameters and the value of the tool in surveillance phases of long-term and adaptive monitoring programs.

AB New technology has enabled recovery of inaccessible natural gas shale deposits; however, the potential impacts to human health from the migration of brines into drinking water or surface spills are unknown. To provide information that can inform these potential impacts, chemical characterization and in vitro toxicologic testing were conducted using pre- and postinjection waters from conventional and unconventional oil and gas wells. Wastewater concentrations may be diluted or reduced by fate and transport processes when released into the environment by unknown amounts, and laboratory studies only imply potential effects. In acute cytotoxicity and wound healing assays, there was dose-dependent toxicity in human and rat cells with growth promotion at low concentrations. Lethality was measured in time studies up to 10 d postinjection. Produced water samples from both well types were equally toxic to human cells and were corrosive at high concentrations. Measurement of protein and gene expression identified metabolic pathways responding to both well types as NADPH quinone oxidoreductase oxidative stress-responsive enzyme and tight junction protein genes. A KCl sample of matched ionic strength showed a different toxicity profile from produced waters, indicating that salts alone were not the cause of toxicity. Organic chemicals and branched alkanes were present in hydraulic fracture wells, and mainly branched alkanes were present in conventional wells. One organic substance was still present after 240 d. The known properties of these chemicals include potential toxicity to multiple human organs, sensitization, irritation, developmental effects, and tumor promotion, depending on the concentrations and synergistic effects of chemicals during exposure.

AB The present study evaluated polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) for quantification of conventional munitions constituents, including trinitrotoluene (TNT), aminodinitrotoluenes, diaminonitrotoluenes, dinitrotoluene, and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) in a field setting. The POCIS were deployed at varying distances from the commonly used explosive formulation composition B (39.5% TNT, 59.5% RDX, 1% wax) in an embayment of Santa Rosa Sound (Pensacola, FL, USA). Time-weighted averaged water concentrations from a 13-d deployment ranged from 9 to 103ng/L for TNT and RDX, respectively, approximately 0.3 to 2m from the source. Concentrations decreased with increasing distance from the source to below quantitation limits (5-7ng/L) at stations greater than 2m away. Moderate biofouling of POCIS membranes after 13 d led to a subsequent effort to quantify potential effects of biofouling on the sampling rate for munitions constituents. After biofouling was allowed to occur for periods of 0, 7, 14, or 28 d at the field site, POCIS were transferred to aquaria spiked with munitions constituents. No significant differences in uptake of TNT or RDX were observed across a gradient of biofouling presence, although the mass of fouling organisms on the membranes was statistically greater for the 28-d field exposure. The present study verified the high sensitivity and integrative nature of POCIS for relevant munitions constituents potentially present in aquatic environments, indicating that application at underwater military munitions sites may be useful for ecological risk assessment.

A bias factor method has been previously proposed to address this concern for peak concentrations, where a bias factor is a multiplicative quantity to upwardly adjust estimates so that the true value is exceeded 95% of the time. In other words, bias factors are statistically protective adjustments. We evaluate this method using a research data set of 69 near-daily sampled site-years from the Atrazine Ecological Monitoring Program, dividing the data set into 23 reference and 46 validation site-years. Bias factors calculated from the reference data set are used to evaluate the method using the validation set for 1) point estimation, 2) interval estimation, and 3) decision-making. Sampling designs are every 7, 14, 28, and 90d; and target quantities of assessment interest are the 90th and 95th percentiles and maximum m-day rolling averages (m=1, 7, 21, 60, 90). We find that bias factors are poor point estimators in comparison with alternative methods. For interval estimation, average coverage is less than nominal, with coverage at individual site-years sometimes very low. Positive correlation of bias factors and target quantities, where present, adversely affects method performance. For decision rules or screening, the method typically shows very low false-negative rates but at the cost of extremely high false-positive rates. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:1864-1876.

AB The occurrence and distribution of 10 organophosphate ester (OP) flame retardants/plasticizers were studied in indoor dust collected in 2 districts of Wuhan City. Total concentrations of the 10 OPs (Sigma OPs) varied from 86.5 to 6389 ng/g in 26 dust samples in Caidian District and from 300 to 10 186 ng/g in 27 samples in Jiang'an District. In most dust samples tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate was dominant over the other OPs, with concentrations of 9.14 to 2722 ng/g (mean 388 ng/g) in Caidian District and 57.3 to 3718 ng/g (mean 616 ng/g) in Jiang'an District. The calculated hazard indices, based on estimated exposure dose via dust ingestion to the reference dose, were much lower than 1. The results suggested that the inhabitants in the 2 regions were at low risk of exposure through dust ingestion. (C) 2017 SETAC

Based on our findings, the 96-h median lethal concentrations (96-h LC50) for un-ionized ammonia-N, nitrite-N, and nitrate-N to E. sosorum are 2.0 +/- 0.32, 31.7 +/- 4.02, and 968.5 +/- 150.6mg/L, respectively. These results establish a benchmark for the tolerance of plethodontid salamanders to these toxicants and indicate that current water quality criteria are adequate for their protection.

AB The use of engineered silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is widespread, with expected release to the terrestrial environment through the application of biosolids onto agricultural lands. The toxicity of AgNPs and silver nitrate (AgNO3; as ionic Ag+) to plant (Elymus lanceolatus and Trifolium pratense) and soil invertebrate (Eisenia andrei and Folsomia candida) species was assessed using Ag-amended biosolids applied to a natural sandy loam soil. Bioavailable Ag+ in soil samples was estimated using an ion-exchange technique applied to KNO3 soil extracts, whereas exposure to dispersible AgNPs was verified by single-particle inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis. Greater toxicity to plant growth and earthworm reproduction was observed in AgNP exposures relative to those of AgNO3, whereas no difference in toxicity was observed for F. candida reproduction. Transformation products in the AgNP-biosolids exposures resulted in larger pools of extractable Ag+ than those from AgNO3-biosolids exposures, at similar total Ag soil concentrations. The results of the present study reveal intrinsic differences in the behavior and bioavailability of the 2 different forms of Ag within the biosolids-soils pathway. The present study demonstrates how analytical methods that target biologically relevant fractions can be used to advance the understanding of AgNP behavior and toxicity in terrestrial environments.

AB Risk assessment in the European Union implements Zn bioavailability models to derive predicted-no-effect concentrations for Zn. These models are validated within certain boundaries (i.e., pH <= 8 and Ca concentrations >= 5 mg/L), but a substantial fraction of the European surface waters falls outside these boundaries. Therefore, we evaluated whether the chronic Zn biotic ligand model (BLM) for Daphnia magna and the chronic bioavailability model for Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata could be extrapolated to pH > 8 and Ca concentrations < 5 mg/L. Results from D. magna experiments suggested that the BLM is not able to reflect the pH effect over a broad pH range (5.5-8.5). In addition, because of Ca deficiency of D. magna in the soft water tests, we cannot conclude whether the BLM is applicable below its Ca boundary. Results for P. subcapitata experiments showed that the bioavailability model can accurately predict Zn toxicity for Ca concentrations down to 0.8 mg/L and pH values up to 8.5. Because the chronic Zn BLM for D. magna could not be extrapolated beyond its validity boundaries for pH, a generalized bioavailability model (gBAM) was developed. Of 4 gBAMs developed, we recommend the use of gBAM-D, which combines a log-linear relation between the 21-d median effective concentrations (expressed as free Zn2+ ion activity) and pH, with more conventional BLM-type competition constants for Na, Ca, and Mg. This model is a first step in further improving the accuracy of chronic toxicity predictions of Zn as a function of water chemistry, which can decrease the uncertainty in implementing the bioavailability-based predicted-no-effect concentration in the risk assessment of high-pH and low-Ca concentration regions in Europe.

AB The risk of a major marine fuel spill in Antarctic waters is increasing, yet there are currently no standard or suitable response methods under extreme Antarctic conditions. Fuel dispersants may present a possible solution; however, little data exist on the toxicity of dispersants or fuels to Antarctic species, thereby preventing informed management decisions. Larval development toxicity tests using 3 life history stages of the Antarctic sea urchin (Sterechinus neumayeri) were completed to assess the toxicity of physically dispersed, chemically dispersed, and dispersant-only water-accommodated fractions (WAFs) of an intermediate fuel oil (IFO 180, BP) and the chemical dispersant Slickgone NS (Dasic International). Despite much lower total petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations, physically dispersed fuels contained higher proportions of low-to-intermediate weight carbon compounds and were generally at least an order of magnitude more toxic than chemically dispersed fuels. Based on concentrations that caused 50% abnormality (EC50) values, the embryonic unhatched blastula life stage was the least affected by fuels and dispersants, whereas the larval 4-armed pluteus stage was the most sensitive. The present study is the first to investigate the possible implications of the use of fuel dispersants for fuel spill response in Antarctica. The results indicate that the use of a fuel dispersant did not increase the hydrocarbon toxicity of IFO 180 to the early life stages of Antarctic sea urchins, relative to physical dispersal.

AB Caddisflies have been included in ecotoxicological studies because of their sensitivity and ecological relevance. The present study aimed to assess the sublethal effects of an anthranilic diamide insecticide, chlorantraniliprole (CAP), to Sericostoma vittatum. Used worldwide, CAP is a persistent compound that has been found in surface waters at concentrations from 0.1 mu g/L to 9.7 mu g/L. It targets the ryanodine receptors, and the present ecotoxicological assessment focused on biomarkers related to neurotransmission, biotransformation, oxidative stress damage, and endpoints related to energy processing (feeding, energy reserves, and cellular metabolism). Six days of exposure trials revealed that feeding activity was significantly decreased in S. vittatum larvae exposed to 0.9 mu g/L CAP. Concomitantly, a reduction in cellular metabolism and a significant decrease in protein content were also observed in caddisfly larvae exposed to CAP, suggesting metabolic depression. The results show that sublethal concentrations of CAP can cause detrimental sublethal effects on S. vittatum total glutathione content at concentrations as low as 0.2 mg/L. Bioenergetics can be used to assess physiological effects of contaminants, and the present results show that exposure to low, environmentally relevant, concentrations of CAP alter energy acquisition and metabolism in nontarget aquatic insects with potential population level effects.

AB Backswimmers (Hemiptera: Heteroptera: Notonectidae) are insect predators in a wide variety of freshwater habitats. These insects are well known through their role as mosquito biocontrol agents, their ability to prey on immature fishes and frogs, and because they are often the first to colonize aquatic habitats. As a consequence, these predators may face intended or unintended insecticide exposures that may lead to death or to impairment of essential behaviors (e.g., swimming and position in the water column). The toxicity of deltamethrin (a type II pyrethroid insecticide stressor) and the swimming activity of the backswimmers Buenoa tarsalis and Martarega bentoi were evaluated. Concentration-mortality and survival bioassays were conducted with the insecticide, which were compared with controls without deltamethrin. Deltamethrin was 26-fold more toxic to B.tarsalis (median lethal concentration [LC50] = 4.0 ng a. i./L) than to M. bentoi (LC50 = 102.5 ng a. i./L). The pattern of occupation of B. tarsalis, but not of M. bentoi, in the water column was also disrupted, and B. tarsalis was forced to stay near the water surface longer with exposure to deltamethrin. Thus, based on the findings, B. tarsalis was less resilient to deltamethrin exposure compared with M. bentoi, and the efficacy of swimming-dependent processes might be negatively affected (e.g., prey catching, partner encounter, and antipredator behaviors) for B. tarsalis under deltamethrin exposure.

AB Large volumes of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) are produced by the oil sands surface mining industry during alkaline hot-water extraction of bitumen. It is well documented that the acid extractable organics (AEOs) in OSPW, a highly complex mixture of acidic and polar neutral substances, are acutely toxic; but few studies have examined the genotoxicity or mutagenicity of this mixture. In the present study, the in vitro SOS Chromotest and the Ames test (TA98 and TA100 strains) were used to evaluate genotoxicity and mutagenicity for whole OSPW AEOs in the presence and absence of biotransformation by rat S9 liver enzymes. Two subfractions were also examined in the same assays: neutral extractable fraction (F1-NE), and the subsequent acid extractable fraction (F2-AE). In the SOS assay, whole AEO was cytotoxic when concentrated 2 x (i.e., twice as concentrated as the environmental sample) and showed increasing genotoxic response above 6x. Co-exposure with S9 had a protective effect on the cell SOS-inducing factor and survival but did not eliminate genotoxicity above 6 x concentrations. Most of the cytotoxicity was attributable to F2-AE, but both F1-NE and F2-AE had similar genotoxic dose-responses above 6 x. In the Ames test without S9, whole AEO was mutagenic in both strains above 10x concentrations. Co-incubation with S9 had little effect on the TA100 strain but with TA98 resulted in bioactivation at midlevel doses (1.5-6.3x) and protection at higher doses (10-25x). The 2 subfractions were mutagenic in both strains but with different dose-responses. Further research in vivo or in more relevant cells is warranted to investigate the carcinogenic risks of OSPW.

AB The Deepwater Horizon oil spill released millions of barrels of crude oil into the northern Gulf of Mexico, much of which remains associated with sediments and can have continuing impacts on biota. Juvenile southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) were exposed for 28d in the laboratory under controlled conditions to reference and Deepwater Horizon oil-contaminated sediments collected from coastal Louisiana to assess the impacts on an ecologically and commercially important benthic fish. The measured polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in the sediments ranged from 0.25mg/kg to 3940mg/kg suite of 50 PAH analytes (tPAH50). Mortality increased with both concentration and duration of exposure. Exposed flounder length and weight was lower compared to controls after 28d of exposure to the sediments with the highest PAH concentration, but condition factor was significantly higher in these fish compared with all other treatments. Histopathological analyses showed increased occurrence of gill abnormalities, including telangiectasis, epithelial proliferation, and fused lamellae in flounder exposed to sediments with the highest tPAH50 concentrations. In addition, hepatic vascular congestion and macrovesicular vacuolation were observed in flounder exposed to the more contaminated sediments. These data suggest that chronic exposure to field collected oil-contaminated sediments results in a variety of sublethal impacts to a benthic fish, with implications for long-term recovery from oil spills.

AB Uptake and membrane transport of cadmium (Cd) in roots of the hyperaccumulator Sedum plumbizincicola X.H. Guo et S.B. Zhou ex L.H. Wu was characterized by assessing the impact of various inhibitors and ion channel blockers on Cd accumulation as well as the real-time net Cd2+ flux at the roots with application of the scanning ion-selective electrode technique. The uncouplers 2,4-dinitrophenol and P-type adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor Na3VO4 significantly limited Cd2+ uptake and transport kinetics in the root of S. plumbizincicola. These findings indicate that Cd is actively taken up into the roots. The Cd content in plant was significantly decreased with pretreatments of the Ca2+ channel blocker La3+ or Gd3+ and the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium, as well as in the presence of higher concentration of Ca2+ and K+. These findings indicated that uptake of Cd2+ into the root of S. plumbizincicola proceeds through ion channels that are permeable to both Ca2+ and K+ as confirmed by the direct evidence of real-time net Cd2+ fluxes at the root surface in the treatments with ion channel inhibitors, as well as in the presence of elevated concentrations of Ca2+ and K+. In addition, the results suggested a role for phytochelatin and protein synthesis in mediating Cd2+ uptake by S. plumbizincicola. These findings increase the understanding of Cd2+ uptake and membrane transport pathways in roots of the Zn/Cd hyperaccumulator S. plumbizincicola. (C) 2016 SETAC

DE Hyalella azteca; Sediment toxicity; Recovery; Interlaboratory validation
AB Environment and Climate Change Canada has developed a 42-d sediment toxicity test that includes a reproduction endpoint with the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca. The new methodology conducts the entire exposure in sediment, in contrast to existing standardized methods whereby adults are transferred to a water-only exposure before release of their first brood at day 28. This midtest transfer to clean water was because of the results of a juvenile H. azteca recovery trial conducted in the 1990s concluding that reproductive endpoints could be biased because of low recovery of young amphipods from sediment. Using a new procedure and reduced volume of sediment, an interlaboratory recovery trial was conducted using 2-d to 5-d old H. azteca added to control sediment. A total of 29 technicians from 8 laboratories participated in the present study. The average recovery for all laboratories and all technicians was 76% (coefficient of variation [CV]=30%). Based on an initial target recovery of at least 80%, 19 of 29 (66%) technicians met this criterion, with an average recovery for this group of 88% (CV=8.3%). Factors that reduced recovery success included: not using a light table, technicians with minimal sediment testing experience, and the use of imported young amphipods with limited acclimation. Excluding those results, the overall average recovery, which included 17 participating technicians, increased from 76% to 88% and lowered the CV from 30% to 8.6%. Based on these results, Environment and Climate Change Canada will recommend 85% average recovery of young in control sediment and require 80% as a technician performance criterion in its new test design for the reproduction methodology.

AB To evaluate the risks of metal mixture effects to natural stream communities under ecologically relevant conditions, the authors conducted 30-d tests with benthic macroinvertebrates exposed to cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) in experimental streams. The simultaneous exposures were with Cd and Zn singly and with Cd+Zn mixtures at environmentally relevant ratios. The tests produced concentration response patterns that for individual taxa were interpreted in the same manner as classic single-species toxicity tests and for community metrics such as taxa richness and mayfly (Ephemeroptera) abundance were interpreted in the same manner as with stream survey data. Effect concentrations from the experimental stream exposures were usually 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than those from classic single-species tests. Relative to a response addition model, which assumes that the joint toxicity of the mixtures can be predicted from the product of their responses to individual toxicants, the Cd+Zn mixtures generally showed slightly less than additive toxicity. The authors applied a modeling approach called Tox to explore the mixture toxicity results and to relate the experimental stream results to field data. The approach predicts the accumulation of toxicants (hydrogen, Cd, and Zn) on organisms using a 2-pK(a) bidentate model that defines interactions between dissolved cations and biological receptors (biotic ligands) and relates that accumulation through a logistic equation to biological response. The Tox modeling was able to predict Cd+Zn mixture responses fromthe single-metal exposures as well as responses from field data. The similarity of response patterns between the 30-d experimental stream tests and field data supports the environmental relevance of testing aquatic insects in experimental streams.

Adding oribatid mites to the assemblage of test species for soil is highly desirable given the enormous diversity and ecological significance of these microarthropods. The authors aimed at revealing how toxicity, lethal body concentration, and bioaccumulation of cadmium (Cd) changed over a period of 7 wk when mites were exposed to Cd-spiked natural soils. The estimated median lethal concentration (LC50) values showed a gradual decrease with time, but a steady state was not reached within 7 wk. Estimates for lethal body concentration varied from 44g Cd/g to 91g Cd/g dry body weight, with a tendency to increase with time. The estimated 50% effective concentration (EC50) for effects on reproduction after 7-wk exposure was 345g Cd/g dry soil. Accumulation of Cd in mites was extremely variable but overall showed a nonsaturating increase. A simple 1-compartment toxicokinetic model did not describe the data well. The analysis suggests that O. nitens has a storage-detoxification strategy that is not at equilibrium under chronic exposure. Considering the tiny body size of the animal, it is remarkable that long exposure times are necessary to reveal chronic toxicity. The use of oribatids provides a clear added value to soil risk assessment but trades off with exposure length. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:408-413. (c) 2016 The Authors.

AB Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used worldwide, most likely leading to their release into the environment and a subsequent increase of environmental concentrations. Studies of their deleterious effects on organisms is crucial to understand their environmental impacts. The freshwater snail Physa acuta was chosen to evaluate the potential deleterious effects of AgNPs and their counterpart AgNO3, through water-only exposures. The toxicity of AgNPs is greatly influenced by medium composition. Thus, 2 media were tested: artificial pond water (APW) and modified APW (adapted by removing calcium chloride). Acute tests (96h) were performed with juvenile and adult snails in both media to assess lethality, and egg mass chronic tests were conducted with APW medium only to assess embryo viability and mortality, carried out until 90% hatching success was reached in the control. Acute toxicity increased with decreasing shell length for both silver forms (ion and nanoparticle); that is, juveniles were more sensitive than adults. Different test media led to dissimilar median lethal concentrations, with chloride playing an important role in toxicity, most likely by complexation with silver ions, which would reduce the bioavailability, uptake, and toxicity of silver. Chronic tests showed that hatching success was more sensitive to silver in the ionic form than in the particulate form. Different forms of silver, exposure media, and life cycle stages led to different patterns of toxicity, highlighting an impairment in the snails' life cycle. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:243-253.

AB Heavy metals can represent a threat to the health of aquatic ecosystems. Unlike organic chemicals, heavy metals cannot be eliminated by natural processes such as their degradation into less toxic compounds, and this creates unique challenges for their remediation from soil, water, and air. Phytoremediation, defined as the use of plants for the removal of environmental contaminants, has many benefits compared to other pollution-reducing methods. Phytoremediation is simple, efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly because it can be carried out at the polluted site, which simplifies logistics and minimizes exposure to humans and wildlife. Macrophytes represent a unique tool to remediate diverse environmental media because they can accumulate heavy metals from contaminated sediment via roots, from water via submerged leaves, and from air via emergent shoots. In this review, a synopsis is presented about how plants, especially macrophytes, respond to heavy metal stress; and we propose potential roles that phytohormones can play in the alleviation of metal toxicity in the aquatic environment. We focus on the uptake, translocation, and accumulation mechanisms of heavy metals in organs of macrophytes and give examples of how phytohormones interact with plant defense systems under heavy metal exposure. We advocate for a more in-depth understanding of these processes to inform more effective metal remediation techniques from metal-polluted water bodies. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-16.

AB Quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis burgensis) are a highly invasive aquatic species to North America, capable of filtering large volumes of water and causing severe ecological and economic impacts. Their range has been expanding since they first invaded the Great Lakes in the 1980s. To predict their spread, it is crucial to understand environmental parameters, which facilitate their range expansion. Two factors likely to influence their distribution include calcium and temperature, because the former is vital for shell development and the latter for metabolic activity. When these factors are optimal for mussels' fitness, the filtration rate has the potential to be maximized if other environmental conditions are also favorable, thus enabling mussels to exploit their growth potential. Deviations from optimal conditions likely result in filtration-rate decline. We identify calcium concentrations and temperatures that maximize the mussel filtration rate for 2 phytoplankton species: Ankistrodesmus facaltus, a common food source for quagga mussels, and a less palatable Microcystis icthyoblabe. In laboratory experiments, filtration rates were measured through cell counts after 24 h of filtration when exposed to a range of temperatures between 2 and 30 degrees C, and calcium concentrations between 0 and 180 mg/L. Response surface methodology was used to identify a maximum filtration rate, which occurred at 22 mL/mg/h at 137 mg/L of calcium carbonate and 26 degrees C when fed Ankistrodesmus. To establish a quagga mussel population in a new water source, optimum conditions are required; thus, this information can be used to rank the relative susceptibility of water bodies to invasion by quagga mussels.

AB The Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) egg bioassay was used to directly compare the toxicity of 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126), 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 77), and 2 environmentally relevant polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixtures over specified dose ranges relative to vehicle and uninjected controls. Measures included lethality and deformities. Results showed clear dose-response relationships for PCB 126 and the 2 PCB mixtures by logistic analysis of covariance using a varying threshold model because there was a low but significant slope for mortality of vehicle controls over incubation. No dose-dependent increase in mortality was observed with PCB 77 treatment. Mortality increased above baseline for PCB 126 and the 2 mixtures after embryonic day 7 (ED07) to a stable slope from ED10. Median lethal doses and thresholds for response differed for PCB 126 and the 2 PCB mixtures, with the mixtures having lower initial toxicity and all showing progressively greater toxicity over the course of development. Further, the lethality of the PCB mixtures appeared to involve both aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and non-AhR mechanisms. Incidence of deformities was unrelated to treatments. In summary, complex mixtures of PCBs were lethal in a dose-related manner, with sublethal effects from exposure to PCB 77. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-14. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Recent research indicates that microplastic (<5 mm) ingestion may impact the immune function of marine and aquatic organisms at the tissue and cellular levels; however, their susceptibility to disease following exposure has not been directly investigated. The objective of the present study was to directly evaluate the impact of microplastic ingestion on the susceptibility of the grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio to bacterial infection with Vibrio campbellii. Grass shrimp were exposed to one of several particle treatments (natural sediment, polyethylene spheres, polypropylene fragments, tire fragments, and polyester fibers) or particle-free water for 96 h at a nominal concentration of 50 000 particles/L prior to a bacterial challenge with V. campbellii. No significant mortality was observed among any of the particle types during the 96-h particle exposure. The survival of grass shrimp following V. campbellii challenge did not vary significantly among shrimp exposed to particle-free water, sediment, polyethylene spheres, polypropylene fragments, tire fragments, and polyester fibers. Grass shrimp cleared the majority of ingested particles and all the ventilated particles within 48 h. The present study shows that microplastic ingestion did not alter the susceptibility of grass shrimp to bacterial infection, and also provides depuration rates for a variety of microplastic shapes and polymer types that were previously lacking. This information increases our understanding of the size- and shape-dependent effects of microplastic ingestion. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2233-2242. (c) 2019 SETAC.

AB The Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulted in the release of large amounts of crude oil into waters of the Gulf of Mexico (USA). A significant portion of the oil reached coastal waters and shorelines where aquatic organisms reside. Four years after the spill, oil remains in small quantities along the coast. Given the high volume of oil coupled with the high ultraviolet light intensities of the Gulf of Mexico, continued polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon phototoxicity may be occurring in the Gulf region. The objective of the present study was to determine the potential for phototoxicity at 5 field sites (oiled, remediated, and unoiled) in Barataria Bay (LA, USA) to caged mysid shrimp and sheepshead minnows and to evaluate the phototoxic potential of field-collected oil water accommodated fractions (WAFs). Water chemistries were similar between field-collected oil WAFs and ambient waters, excluding the most oiled field site. Field bioassays indicated no phototoxic risk of heavily weathered crude oil under the highly turbid conditions present during the study. Laboratory WAFs of field-collected oil resulted in phototoxicity to mysid shrimp, suggesting a potential for phototoxicity of heavily weathered crude oil remaining in the Gulf of Mexico.

AB Carbonaceous nanomaterials, such as fullerenes (C60, C70) and the derivative phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), have promising application in solar energy technologies. Although the acute ecotoxicity of C60 has been reported widely in the literature, ecotoxicity assays for different fullerene forms and broader ecosystem impact studies remain scarce. To address these knowledge gaps, acute, chronic, and life stage exposure studies with freshwater zooplankton, Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex, were performed for each material. Experimental results indicated that C60 and PCBM are not acutely toxic at estimated environmentally relevant concentrations; however, C70 had significant acute effects. All forms of fullerene caused a gradual elevation in heart rate over time and visual darkening of the Daphnia spp. carapace. The impact of fullerenes on susceptibility to predation was then assessed experimentally by presenting D. pulex to the visual predator Lepomis macrochirus (bluegill). Predation risk was significantly increased in fullerene-exposed D. pulex. The present study underscores the need to broaden the scope of traditional ecotoxicity for emerging materials: studies are required that evaluate portfolios of related nanomaterials and that capture chronic and cascading ecosystem-level effects.

AB The present study examined the effects of soil physical and chemical properties on the toxicity of lead (Pb) to earthworms (Eisenia fetida) and collembolans (Folsomia candida), and on bioaccumulation of Pb by earthworms, in soils amended with Pb salts. Toxicity tests were conducted in 7 soils varying in soil properties (pH 4.7-7.4, effective cation exchange capacity [eCEC] 4-42 cmol(c)/kg, organic carbon 10-50 g C/kg) that were leached and pH corrected after spiking with PbCl2. The median effect concentrations (EC50s) based on total soil Pb concentrations ranged from 35 to 5080 mg Pb/kg for earthworms and 389 to >7190 mg/kg for Collembola. Significant positive correlations were observed between log (EC50) for earthworm reproduction and log (eCEC, total C, exchangeable Ca and Mg, or clay content), but no significant correlations were observed between Pb toxicity to Collembola and soil properties. Expressing Pb dose as either the free ion (Pb2+) activity in porewater or as the measured dissolved porewater concentration of Pb did not explain differences in toxicity among soils. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for Pb in earthworms ranged up to >10-fold across 6 soil treatments, with a median of 0.16, and the BAF was significantly correlated with eCEC (p = 0.038, r = -0.84), but not with any other soil properties. Soil properties related to eCEC (total C, exchangeable Ca and Mg, clay content) had a significant effect on Pb toxicity and bioaccumulation in earthworms, but no relationship was found for Collembola. As a major soil property affecting the bioavailability of Pb, CEC should be incorporated into any soil hazard assessment of Pb as a modifying factor of toxicity and bioaccumulation for earthworms.

AB The Tenax technique was used as an alternative exposure metric to assess the bioavailability of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from contaminated marine sediments. The sediments used were collected from 2 Superfund sites, New Bedford Harbor (MA, USA) and Gould Island (RI, USA). No sieving was conducted for either sediment after arrival, and sediments were stored in stainless steel drums at 2.8 to 4.0 degrees C in the dark until use. Exhaustive chemical extractions, single-point 24-h Tenax extractions, and 14-d bioaccumulation tests using the amphipod Leptocheirus plumulosus were conducted for both sediments. The sum of 119 PCB congeners from total exhaustive chemical extraction in the New Bedford Harbor and Gould Island sediments were 1084 and 188.2 mu g/g organic carbon, respectively. The PCB concentrations from the bioaccumulation tests and Tenax extractions showed that both exposure metrics followed a similar trend in amount and distribution of PCB congeners. The results from both exposure metrics were fit into a log-log linear regression, and then compared with a previously developed log-log linear model for freshwater organisms. The results showed that although the marine data fell within the prediction intervals of the freshwater linear model, the marine regression followed a lower trajectory due to the differences in both the slopes and intercepts between the marine and freshwater regressions. The present study showed a strong relationship between Tenax and marine invertebrate PCB concentrations. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1188-1197. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Non-aqueous-phase liquids (NAPLs), composed primarily of organic solvents and other immiscible liquids, can be found in the subsurface at many industrial sites. The chemical composition of NAPLs is often complex and, in many instances, difficult to fully characterize using conventional analytical techniques based on targeted compound analysis. Incomplete characterization of NAPLs leaves gaps in the understanding of the chemical profile at an impacted site. Previous work has shown that nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy may be able to assist in the improved characterization of complex NAPL samples. In general, NMR spectroscopy provides an unbiased approach for the analysis of organic compounds because different classes of compounds are all treated and analyzed using the same methods. In addition, NMR spectroscopy provides unique structural information that can be used to elucidate unknowns. The present study describes the use of NMR spectroscopy as a nontargeted tool to characterize the composition of NAPLs collected from an impacted site. It is shown that NMR spectroscopy can be a complementary tool to be used in site assessments to help provide improved understanding of NAPL chemistry, leading to the development of improved conceptual site models and improved strategies for remedial and managerial activities at impacted sites.

AB In the upper Hudson River, New York, USA, fish were exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from the 1940s to 1977, and PCBs still persist in this environment. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens), brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), and largemouth bass (M. salmoides) were collected annually from 2003 to 2009 from 1 control site upstream of the PCB discharge locations and from 2 sites downstream from where PCBs were released. Fish PCB concentrations were estimated, and 3 population metrics were examined: 1) relative abundance, 2) weight-to-length ratio, and 3) growth. Normalized lipid-based PCB concentrations at the 2 PCB exposure pools averaged approximately 100 to 600 mu g/g. Estimated relative abundances with electrofishing were higher for largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and brown bullhead at PCB exposure sites compared to the control site; but yellow perch were more abundant at the control site. Weight to length ratios varied among sites and species, but no consistent pattern was evident in relation to PCBs at the population level or for individual fish. Growth rates for yellow perch and brown bullhead were similar among sites. Largemouth bass growth was slightly higher at the control site compared to the 2 PCB sites, but smallmouth bass growth was much higher at the PCB sites compared to the control site. We could not detect any relation or influence of PCBs on the 3 population metrics that we examined. the present results corroborated those of previous investigations concerning the effects of PCBs on fishes. We recommend stronger consideration of the biological impacts of PCBs at the population level when conducting risk assessments. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:329-339. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB The continuously growing number of products containing nanoparticles (NPs) makes their presence in the environment inevitable, and given the well-known toxicity of dissolved metals, concerns regarding the toxicity of metal-based NPs have been raised. Whether metal-based NPs present similar or different toxicological effects compared with metal salts is an emerging field. In the present study, rainbow trout were intraperitoneally injected with CuSO4 or copper NPs (CuNPs) to investigate tissue distribution and depuration characteristics. Fish injected with Cu showed an initial accumulation of Cu in the liver, kidney, gills, intestine, and carcass. The Cu concentration in the liver of CuNP-injected fish increased over time. It appears as though CuNPs accumulated in the liver at a greater rate than they were excreted. In livers of fish injected with CuSO4, the Cu concentration appeared to increase and reach an equilibrium, suggesting that copper was accumulated and excreted at the same rate. The possibility that CuNPs can accumulate at a higher rate than it is excreted in the liver warrants further investigation. The present study demonstrates the possibility of dietary uptake of CuNPs because elevated Cu concentrations were observed in carcass, gills, kidney, and intestine of fish gavaged with CuNPs. In conclusion, the results suggest that dietary CuNPs are taken up by the gut and preferentially accumulate in the liver. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:80-89. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Anthropogenic chemical exposure can result in overall reductions in reproductive success. Using the round stingray (Urobatis halleri) as an elasmobranch model with internal gestation, we measured female fecundity and embryo growth from postovulation to near parturition to test the hypothesis that environmental polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination would impair reproductive success. Two sites were sampled from southern California, USA: the mainland site was exposed to legacy PCB contamination (with low exposure to other anthropogenic contaminants), and the offshore reference site at Catalina Island was a separate population with low anthropogenic influence. Contaminant-exposed embryos weighed less at each stage of development than reference embryos, while accumulating proportionately more liver mass over development. Furthermore, environmental contamination negatively affected male embryos more than female embryos. The present study is the first study to demonstrate a negative effect of contaminant exposure on elasmobranch embryo growth, with probable fitness costs later in life.

AB The diffusivity of 145 compounds in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) material was determined in the laboratory using a film stacking technique. The results were pooled with available literature data, providing a final data set of 198 compounds with diffusivity (D-PDMS) spanning over approximately 5 log units. The principal variables controlling the diffusivity of penetrants were investigated by comparing D-PDMS within and between different homologous series. The dipole moment, molecular size, and flexibility of penetrants appear to be the most prevalent factors controlling a compound's diffusivity. A nonlinear quantitative structure-property relationship is proposed using as predicting variables the molecular volume, the number of rotatable bonds, the topological polar surface area, and the number of O and N atoms. The final relationship has a correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.81 and a mean absolute error of 0.26 m(2) s(-1) (log unit), approaching the average error for the experimentally determined values (0.12 m(2) s(-1)). The model, based on a heuristic approach, is ready for use by analytical chemists with no specific background in theoretical chemistry (notably for passive sampler development). (C) 2018 SETAC

AB Assessment of uranium (U)-contaminated sediment is often hindered by the inability to accurately account for the physicochemical properties of sediment that modify U bioavailability. The present goal was to determine whether sediment-associated U bioavailability could be predicted over a wide range of conditions and sediment properties using simple regressions and a geochemical speciation model, the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (WHAM7). Data from a Ucontaminated field sediment bioaccumulation test, along with previously published bioaccumulation studies with U-spiked field and formulated sediments, were used to examine the models. Observed U concentrations in Chironomus dilutus larvae exposed to U-spiked and U-contaminated sediments correlated well (r(2) > 0.74, p < 0.001) with the WHAM-calculated concentration of U bound to humic acid, indicating that humic acid may be a suitable surrogate for U binding sites (biotic ligands) in C. dilutus larvae. Subsequently, the concentration of U in C. dilutus was predicted with WHAM7 by numerically optimizing the equivalent mass of humic acid per gram of organism. The predicted concentrations of U in C. dilutus larvae exposed to U-spiked and U-contaminated field sediment compared well with the observed values, where one of the regression models provided a slightly better fit (mean absolute error = 18.1 mg U/kg dry wt) than WHAM7 (mean absolute error = 34.2 mg U/kg dry wt). The regression model provides a predictive capacity with a minimal number of variables, whereas WHAM7 provides additional complementary insight into the chemical variables influencing the speciation, sorption, and bioavailability of U in sediment. The present results indicate that physicochemical properties of sediment can be used to account for variability in U bioavailability as measured through bioaccumulation in chironomids exposed to U-contaminated sediments.

AB Currently toxicity data for iron (Fe) in seawater are limited; furthermore, these data are of poor quality as a result of the importance of Fe solubility in test solutions being overlooked. The present study characterized the solubility and lability of Fe(III) in seawater and then examined the effects of Fe(III) on the fertilization success and larval survival of the tropical marine scleractinian corals Acropora spathulata and Platygyra daedalea. We present the first assessment of the effects of Fe on the early life stages of scleractinian corals. Concentrations of both soluble and labile forms of Fe were very low, with dissolved Fe concentrations <= 0.195 mg/L in bioassay test solutions and chemical determinations revealing labile Fe concentrations <= 1.21 mg/L. For fertilization experiments, the median effect concentration (EC50) value for total Fe was 25 mg/L for the most sensitive species, P. daedalea, whereas the EC50 values for A. spathulata ranged between 40 and 66 mg/L. The median lethal concentration value for P. daedalea larval survival was 47 mg/L Fe after 72-h exposure. We provide Fe toxicity data for tropical marine keystone species that could be used to help generate more reliable guideline values for Fe in marine waters. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Beef cattle in the United States are routinely administered ractopamine, a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, to enhance growth. The present study is the first to quantify ractopamine in feedyard-emitted particulate matter and playa wetlands near feedyards. Ractopamine was present in 92% of particulate matter samples, 16% of playa sediment samples, and 3% of playa water samples, at maximum concentrations of 4.7 mu g/g, 5.2 ng/g (dry wt), and 271 ng/L, respectively. These data suggest that aerial transmission and deposition of particulate matter is a transport mechanism for ractopamine between feedyards and aquatic systems in the region. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Systemic neonicotinoid insecticides used in urban arboriculture could pose a risk to bees and other pollinators foraging on treated plants. We measured uptake and dissipation of soil-applied imidacloprid and dinotefuran in nectar and leaves of 2 woody plant species, a broadleaf evergreen tree (Ilexxattenuata) and a deciduous shrub (Clethra alnifolia), to assess concentrations to which pollinators and pests might be exposed in landscape settings. Three application timings, autumn (postbloom), spring (prebloom), and summer (early postbloom), were evaluated to see if taking advantage of differences in the neonicotinoids' systemic mobility and persistence might enable pest control while minimizing transference into nectar. Nectar and tissue samples were collected from in-ground plants and analyzed for residues by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) in 2 successive years. Concentrations found in nectar following autumn or spring applications ranged from 166 to 515ng/g for imidacloprid and from 70 to 1235ng/gg for dinotefuran, depending on plant and timing. These residues exceed concentrations shown to adversely affect individual- and colony-level traits of bees. Summer application mitigated concentrations of imidacloprid (8-31ng/g), but not dinotefuran (235-1191ng/g), in nectar. Our data suggest that dinotefuran may be more persistent than is generally believed. Implications for integrated pest and pollinator management in urban landscapes are discussed.

AB Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) are widely used in many industries. The increasing release of CuO NPs from both intentional and unintentional sources into the environment may pose risks to rice plants, thereby reducing the quality or quantity of this staple grain in the human diet. Not only has arsenic (As) contamination decreased rice yield, but As accumulation in rice has also been a great human health concern for a few decades. New technologies have succeeded in removing As from water by nanomaterials. By all accounts, few studies have addressed CuO NP phytotoxicity to rice, and the interactions of CuO NPs with As are poorly described. The present study 1) reviews studies about the environmental behavior and phytotoxicity of CuO NPs and As and research about the interaction of CuO NPs with As in the environment, 2) discusses critically the potential mechanisms of CuO NP and As toxicity in plants and their interaction, and 3) proposes future research directions for solving the As problem in rice.

AB Freshwater ecosystems face very strong anthropogenic pressures, among which overexploitation, habitat degradation, flow modification, species invasion, and water pollution lead to growing threats on biodiversity. Urbanization through wastewater treatment, industry through the release of inorganic and organic chemicals, and agriculture through the use of pesticides and herbicides are the main factors involved in water pollution. In France, more precisely in the Pyrenees-Orientales department, the poor quality of the watercourses is attributable overall to the use of glyphosate-based herbicides in agricultural activities. Because these chemicals can impact individuals, populations, and biodiversity, we investigated, under experimental conditions, the physiological response of animals facing abiotic contaminants. We selected as a model, juveniles of the freshwater turtle Trachemys scripta elegans. We measured the gene expression and activity of the catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes as well as the levels of lipid peroxidation, which are all oxidative stress biomarkers, in turtles challenged with high concentrations of glyphosate-based herbicides, on the one hand, and with degraded waters collected from a local watercourse, on the other. We also measured the acetylcholinesterase activity across the same animals. We showed through variations in gene expression and enzyme activity that a glyphosate commercial formulation induced a stress in turtles. A similar outcome was obtained when turtles faced degraded waters. The results indicated that the poor quality of regional waters could be a real threat for animal health. Because turtles are globally less sensitive to contaminants than amphibians, which are lacking in the degraded waters of the Pyrenees-Orientales department, they could constitute an excellent model to follow the evolution of water quality through the study of oxidative stress biomarkers.

AB Daphnia in the natural environment experience fluctuations in algal food supply, with periods when algal populations bloom and seasons when Daphnia have very little algal food. Standardized chronic toxicity tests, used for ecological risk assessment, dictate that Daphnia must be fed up to 400 times more food than they would experience in the natural environment (outside of algal blooms) for a toxicity test to be valid. This disconnect can lead to underestimating the toxicity of a contaminant. We followed the growth, reproduction, and survival of Daphnia exposed to 75 and 200 mu g/L silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) at 4 food rations for up to 99d and found that AgNP exposure at low, environmentally relevant food rations increased the toxicity of AgNPs. Exposure to AgNP at low food rations decreased the survival and/or reproduction of individuals, with potential consequences for Daphnia populations (based on calculated specific population growth rates). We also found tentative evidence that a sublethal concentration of AgNPs (75 mu g/L) caused Daphnia to alter energy allocation away from reproduction and toward survival and growth. The present findings emphasize the need to consider resource availability, and not just exposure, in the environment when estimating the effect of a toxicant. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3008-3018.

AB Amphibians are susceptible to exposure from contaminants via multiple pathways. Pyraclostrobin fungicides have been shown to be toxic to terrestrial amphibians at environmentally relevant concentrations; however, these studies did not account for factors that may influence exposure and effects, such as fungicide formulation, age of the individual, exposure route, and physiological state of the individual. We examined Headline (R) and Headline AMP (R) fungicide toxicity to adult Anaxyrus cognatus and Anaxyrus woodhousii by direct overspray, as well as acute toxicity of Headline AMP to juvenile A. cognatus through direct overspray, previously exposed soils, and diet. We also assessed effects of hydration state on fungicide toxicity in juvenile A. cognatus and sublethal effects of fungicide exposure on prey-orientation ability of juvenile A. cognatus. Neither formulation of Headline caused mortality of adult A. cognatus and A. woodhousii at up to 5 times the maximum label rate in North American corn (1052 and 879 mL formulation/ha for Headline AMP and Headline fungicides, respectively, corresponding to 1.52 and 2.2 mu g pyraclostrobin/cm(2), respectively). Exposures of juvenile A. cognatus to Headline AMP via direct overspray and previously exposed soils (2 types) resulted in median lethal rate (LR50) values of 2.4, 3.34, and 3.61 mu g pyraclostrobin/cm(2), respectively. Dietary Headline AMP exposure was not toxic, prey-orientations were not influenced by exposure, and effects were similar between dehydrated and hydrated treatments (LR50 = 2.4 and 2.3 mg pyraclostrobin/cm2, respectively). These results, combined with exposure concentrations reported in previous studies, suggest that risk of acute mortality for amphibians in terrestrial environments is low and is dictated by body size and site-specific factors influencing exposure.

AB The validity of the application of mixture toxicity models, concentration addition and independent action, to a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) for calculation of a multisubstance potentially affected fraction was examined in laboratory experiments. Toxicity assays of herbicide mixtures using 5 species of periphytic algae were conducted. Two mixture experiments were designed: a mixture of 5 herbicides with similar modes of action and a mixture of 5 herbicides with dissimilar modes of action, corresponding to the assumptions of the concentration addition and independent action models, respectively. Experimentally obtained mixture effects on 5 algal species were converted to the fraction of affected (>50% effect on growth rate) species. The predictive ability of the concentration addition and independent action models with direct application to SSD depended on the mode of action of chemicals. That is, prediction was better for the concentration addition model than the independent action model for the mixture of herbicides with similar modes of action. In contrast, prediction was better for the independent action model than the concentration addition model for the mixture of herbicides with dissimilar modes of action. Thus, the concentration addition and independent action models could be applied to SSD in the same manner as for a single-species effect. The present study to validate the application of the concentration addition and independent action models to SSD supports the usefulness of the multisubstance potentially affected fraction as the index of ecological risk.

AB Toxicity testing with Antarctic species is required for risk assessment of fuel spills in Antarctic coastal waters. The lethal and sublethal (movement behavior) sensitivities of adults and juveniles of the Antarctic amphipod Paramoera walkeri to the water accommodated fractions (WAFs) of 3 fuels were estimated in extended-duration tests at -1 degrees C to 21 d. Response of P. walkeri for lethal hydrocarbon concentrations was slow, with 50% lethal concentrations (LC50s) first able to be estimated at 7 d for adults exposed to Special Antarctic Blend diesel (SAB), which had the highest hydrocarbon concentrations of the 3 fuel WAFs. Juveniles showed greater response to marine gas oil (MGO) and intermediate residual fuel oil (IFO 180) at longer exposure durations and were most sensitive at 21 d to IFO 180 (LC50 12 mu g/L). Adults were initially more sensitive than juveniles; at 21 d, however, juveniles were more than twice as sensitive as adults to SAB (LC50 =153 mu g/L and 377 mu g/L, respectively). Significant effects on movement behavior were evident at earlier time points and lower concentrations than was mortality in all 3 fuel WAFs, and juveniles were highly sensitive to sublethal effects of MGO. These first estimates of Antarctic amphipod sensitivity to diesel and fuel oils in seawater contribute to the development of ecologically relevant risk assessments for management of hydrocarbon contamination in the region.

AB To identify potential biomarkers of salt stress in a freshwater sentinel species, we examined transcriptional responses of the common mussel Elliptio complanata to controlled sodium chloride (NaCl) exposures. Ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-Seq) of mantle tissue identified 481 transcripts differentially expressed in adult mussels exposed to 2 ppt NaCl (1.2 ppt chloride) for 7 d, of which 290 had nonoverlapping intervals. Differentially expressed gene categories included ion and transmembrane transport, oxidoreductase activity, maintenance of protein folding, and amino acid metabolism. The rate-limiting enzyme for synthesis of taurine, an amino acid frequently linked to osmotic stress in aquatic species, was upregulated, as was the transmembrane ion pump sodium/potassium adenosine 5'-triphosphatase. These patterns confirm a primary transcriptional response to the experimental dose, albeit likely overlapping with nonspecific secondary stress responses. Substantial involvement of the heat shock protein 70 chaperone family and the water-transporting aquaporin family was not detected, however, in contrast to some studies in other bivalves. A subset of the most significantly regulated genes was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in an independent sample. Cluster analysis showed separation of mussels exposed to 2 ppt NaCl from control mussels in multivariate space, but mussels exposed to 1 ppt NaCl were largely indistinguishable from controls. Transcriptome-scale analysis of salt exposure under laboratory conditions efficiently identified candidate biomarkers for further functional analysis and field validation.

AB The field of environmental toxicology developed as a result of growing concerns about anthropogenic influences on the environment and how to ameliorate ecological impact. Many governmental bodies are beginning to emphasize prevention rather than mitigation when addressing novel products, leading to more of a focus on identifying potential toxicity prior to release. With the exponential advances in their development and sale, novel metamaterials and biotechnology are set to dramatically outpace the capabilities of current testing strategies. To address the need for a fast, cost-effective means of testing chemicals, high-throughput screening (HTS) is currently being used in toxicology and being adapted to ecotoxicology in projects such as ToxCast and Tox21. Despite the growth of research using HTS platforms, its role in ecotoxicology is still uncertain, particularly in how it should be applied in regulation. The aim of the present review is to discuss common test strategies used in designing HTS platforms, the current potential applications for ecotoxicological research, its role in regulatory policies, and its ability to address growing concerns such as engineered nanomaterials.

AB The present study evaluated the ability of 2 different bioretention storm water control measures (SCMs), planter boxes and swales, to decrease the toxicity of sheet copper (Cu) roofing runoff to Daphnia magna. The present study quantified changes in storm water chemistry as it passed through the bioretention systems and utilized the biotic ligand model (BLM) to assess whether the observed D. magna toxicity could be predicted by variations found in water chemistry. Laboratory toxicity tests were performed using select storm samples with D. magna cultured under low ionic strength conditions that were appropriate for the low ionic strength of the storm water samples being tested. The SCMs decreased toxicity of Cu roof runoff in both the BLM results and the storm water bioassays. Water exiting the SCMs was substantially higher than influent runoff in pH, ions, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon and substantially lower in total and dissolved Cu. Daphnids experienced complete mortality in untreated runoff from the Cu roof (the SCM influent); however, for planter and swale effluents, survival averaged 86% and 95%, respectively. The present study demonstrated that conventional bioretention practices, including planter boxes and swales, are capable of decreasing the risk of adverse effects from sheet Cu roof runoff to receiving systems, even before considering dilution of effluents in those receiving systems and associated further reductions in copper bioavailability.

In the present study, feeding-exposure experiments were used to determine whether pollen from transgenic rice harms A. mellifera worker bees. In 1 experiment, the survival and mean acinus diameter of hypopharyngeal glands of adult bees were similar when bees were fed on pollen from Bt rice lines or from a non-Bt rice line, but bee survival was significantly reduced when they received pollen that was mixed with potassium arsenate as a positive control. In a second experiment, bee survival and hypopharyngeal gland development were not reduced when adult bees were fed on non-Bt pollen and a sucrose solution supplemented with Cry2A at 400 mg/g, Cry1C at 50 mg/g, or bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 400 mg/g, but bee survival and hypopharyngeal gland development were reduced when the diet was supplemented with soybean trypsin inhibitor as a positive control. In both experiments, the uptake of Cry proteins by adult bees was confirmed. Overall, the results indicate that the planting of Bt rice lines expressing Cry2A or Cry1C protein poses a negligible risk to A. mellifera worker bees. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Characterization of the aquatic toxicity of oil is needed to support hazard assessment and inform spill response. Natural processes and mitigation strategies involving dispersant use can result in exposures to both dissolved and droplet oil that are not typically differentiated when oil exposures are characterized in toxicity tests. Thus, the impact of droplets on aquatic toxicity is largely uncharacterized. To improve the understanding of the role of droplets, acute toxicity tests with Daphnia magna and Americamysis bahia were performed with Endicott crude oil in low-energy mixing systems with and without Corexit 9500 dispersant. Exposures were also prepared by placing crude oil in silicone tubing and passively dosing test media to provide dissolved oil exposures without droplets. A framework is described for characterizing dissolved phase exposures using both mechanistic modeling and passive sampling measurements. The approach is then illustrated by application to data from the present study. Expression of toxicity in terms of toxic units calculated from modeled dissolved oil concentrations or passive sampling measurements showed similar dose responses between exposure systems and organisms, despite the gradient in droplet oil. These results indicate that droplets do not appreciably contribute to toxicity for the 2 species investigated and further support hazard evaluation of dispersed oil on the basis of dissolved exposure metrics.

AB Interest in stream mesocosms has recently revived for higher tier aquatic macrophyte risk assessment of plant protection products mainly because 1) the highest predicted environmental concentrations for the assessment of effects are frequently derived from stream scenarios, and 2) they allow an effect assessment using stream-typical pulse exposures. Therefore, the present stream mesocosm study used an herbicide pulse exposure and evaluated the responses of Elodea canadensis and Myriophyllum spicatum. Macrophytes were exposed for 24h to 1g/L, 3g/L, 10g/L, and 30g/L of the herbicide iofensulfuron-sodium with a subsequent recovery period of 42d. Biological endpoints were growth rates of the main, side, and total shoot length, the shoot number, the maximum root length, and the dry weight. The total shoot length was identified as the most sensitive endpoint; the growth rate of the total shoot length was inhibited by up to 66% and 45% in M. spicatum and E. canadensis, respectively. The lowest no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) were observed at day 7 and/or day 14 after herbicide treatment and were 1g/L for M. spicatum and 3g/L for E. canadensis. The no-observed-ecologically-adverse-effect concentrations (NOEAECs) were 10g/L and 30g/L for M. spicatum and E. canadensis, respectively. Such or similar mesocosm designs are useful to simulate typical stream exposures and estimate herbicide effects on aquatic macrophytes in stream systems. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Isolated hepatocytes and liver S9 fractions have been used to collect in vitro biotransformation data for fish as a means of improving modeled estimates of chemical bioaccumulation. To date, however, there have been few direct comparisons of these 2 methods. In the present study, cryopreserved trout hepatocytes were used to measure in vitro intrinsic clearance rates for 6 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These rates were extrapolated to estimates of in vivo intrinsic clearance and used as inputs to a well stirred liver model to predict hepatic clearance. Predicted rates of hepatic clearance were then evaluated by comparison with measured rates determined previously using isolated perfused livers. Hepatic clearance rates predicted using hepatocytes were in good agreement with measured values (<2.1-fold difference for 5 of 6 compounds) under 2 competing binding assumptions. These findings, which may be attributed in part to high rates of PAH metabolism, are similar to those obtained previously using data from liver S9 fractions. For 1 compound (benzo[a]pyrene), the in vivo intrinsic clearance rate calculated using S9 data was 10-fold higher than that determined using hepatocytes, possibly due to a diffusion limitation on cellular uptake. Generally, however, there was good agreement between calculated in vivo intrinsic clearance rates obtained using either in vitro test system. These results suggest that both systems can be used to improve bioaccumulation assessments for fish, particularly when vitro rates of activity are relatively high, although additional work is needed to determine if the chemical domain of applicability for each system differs.

AB There is a need to study the time course of toxic chemical effects on organisms because there might be a time lag between the onset of chemical exposure and the corresponding adverse effects. For aquatic organisms, crude oil and oil constituents originating from either natural seeps or human activities can be relevant case studies. In the present study the authors tested a generic toxicokinetic model to quantify the time-varying effects of various oil constituents on the survival of aquatic organisms. The model is based on key parameters applicable to an array of species and compounds with baseline toxicity reflected by a generic, internal toxicity threshold or critical body burden (CBB). They compared model estimates with experimental data on the effects of 8 aromatic oil constituents on the survival of aquatic species including crustaceans and fish. The average model uncertainty, expressed as the root mean square error, was 0.25 (minimum-maximum, 0.04-0.67) on a scale between 0 and 1. The estimated survival was generally lower than the measured survival right after the onset of oil constituent exposure. In contrast, the model underestimated the maximum mortality for crustaceans and fish observed in the laboratory. Thus, the model based on the CBB concept failed to adequately predict the lethal effects of the oil constituents on crustaceans and fish. Possible explanations for the deviations between model estimates and observations may include incorrect assumptions regarding a constant lethal body burden, the absence of biotransformation products, and the steady state of aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in organisms. Clearly, a more complex model approach than the generic model used in the present study is needed to predict toxicity dynamics of narcotic chemicals. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:128-136.

AB The temporal dynamics of pesticide concentrations in streams remains poorly characterized in southwestern Ontario, a region of the province where land use is dominated by agriculture. Understanding the magnitude and duration of pulsed exposures to pesticides in these small streams is critical when estimating the risk of pesticides to these aquatic ecosystems. The present study investigated the application of a high-frequency water sampling approach paired with the collection of flow data to characterize the pulsed exposure of pesticides to small streams in southwestern Ontario. Six sites along 2 different streams with different magnitudes of agricultural land use in their upstream catchments were sampled using half-day composite samples from July to October 2018 and from May to September 2019. A total of 1043 samples were collected over the 2 yr, of which 210 were analyzed. Samples for analysis were chosen based on flow, water level, and precipitation data. Liquid and gas chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure >500 pesticides in each water sample. A total of 35 different compounds were detected over the 6 sampling sites. For pesticides that were detected in >10% of water samples above the method quantification limit, a deterministic risk assessment using water quality guidelines and a probabilistic risk assessment using species sensitivity distributions were performed. The calculated hazard quotients showed that 2,4-D, atrazine, metolachlor, and metribuzin exceeded a level of concern of 1 at the highest concentrations detected. In all cases, hazard concentrations that would be protective of 95% of species from the species sensitivity distributions were greater than the 95th centile of the environmental exposure distributions, meaning that the risk from the pesticides was low.

AB In pesticide risk assessments, semifield studies, such as large-scale colony feeding studies (LSCFSs), are conducted to assess potential risks at the honey bee colony level. However, such studies are very cost and time intensive, and high overwintering losses of untreated control hives have been observed in some studies. Honey bee colony models such as BEEHAVE may provide tools to systematically assess multiple factors influencing colony outcomes, to inform study design, and to estimate pesticide impacts under varying environmental conditions. Before they can be used reliably, models should be validated to demonstrate they can appropriately reproduce patterns observed in the field. Despite the recognized need for validation, methodologies to be used in the context of applied ecological models are not agreed on. For the parameterization, calibration, and validation of BEEHAVE, we used control data from multiple LSCFSs. We conducted detailed visual and quantitative performance analyses as a demonstration of validation methodologies. The BEEHAVE outputs showed good agreement with apiary-specific validation data sets representing the first year of the studies. However, the simulations of colony dynamics in the spring periods following overwintering were identified as less reliable. The comprehensive validation effort applied provides important insights that can inform the usability of BEEHAVE in applications related to higher tier risk assessments. In addition, the validation methodology applied could be used in a wider context of ecological models.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-17.

AB Microplastics are emerging threat contaminants that have been shown to provide toxic pollutants, either from the environment or from their inherent toxic monomers and additives, a pathway into the aquatic food web. In the present study, the occurrence, abundance, and composition of microplastic load in the surface water of Lake Naivasha (Kenya) was determined. The surface water physicochemical parameters were measured in situ; microplastic samples were collected using plankton net trawls and treated with H2O2 to decompose organic matter. The microplastic particles recovered were classified both by visual observation and by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The average microplastic concentration range in surface water was 0.183 +/- 0.017 to 0.633 +/- 0.067 particles/m(2), with the mean concentration being 0.407 +/- 0.135 particles/m(2). Fragments, fibers, and films were identified and were mostly composed of polypropylene, polyethylene, and polyester. We also performed correlational analysis, which showed a strong positive association between microplastic quantity and turbidity, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus in the lake. The high variability in microplastic densities exhibited between the sampled locations was attributed to human activities, water and wastewater intake through rivers and tributaries, and the presence of local wind patterns responsible for the general water circulation. Our assessment adds to the growing documentation of microplastic presence in freshwater ecosystems, and provides a baseline for future monitoring and assessment in sediment and biota of Lake Naivasha and other Kenyan freshwater systems.

AB Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a broad class of environmentally persistent chemicals that include thousands of potentially toxic synthetic organic molecules. Some PFAS have been shown to cause adverse health effects including decreased total cholesterol, birth weight, and reproductive success in laboratory animals; however, a lack of chronic toxicity data exists for PFAS in avian ecological receptors. The present study reports on the chronic toxicity of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and a mixture of PFOS and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) to northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) via oral exposure from drinking water. Female weight gain was adversely affected at an average daily intake (ADI) of 3.10 x 10(-3) +/- 0.15 x 10(-3) mg PFOS:PFHxS (1.2:1) mixture x kg(-1) body weight x d(-1). Successful liberation from the shell once pipped was adversely affected at an ADI of 2.45 x 10(-3) +/- 0.01 x 10(-3) mg PFOS x kg(-1) body weight x d(-1). These values are comparatively much lower than the current dietary avian toxicity reference value (TRV) derived from birds that were exposed via feed, suggesting the need for updated avian TRVs. Relationships between test chemical (PFOS) and test substance (PFOS:PFHxS) showed that PFOS and PFHxS have possible interacting effects in avian receptors and likely differing mechanisms of toxicity depending on chemical co-occurrence and dose. Both the single-chemical and mixture exposures produced similar and possibly additive toxicity values. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-11. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB We report sublethal effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of chlorpyrifos at the individual (swimming alterations) and biochemical (esterase activities and antioxidant enzymes) levels in the Montevideo tree frog Boana pulchella larvae. The 50% lethal concentration at 96 h (LC50-96h) for chlorpyrifos in stage-29 B. pulchella tadpoles was 0.98 mg/L, which was close to the 65th percentile of published anuran species sensitivity. In B. pulchella, chlorpyrifos disrupted biochemical processes: tadpoles showed a significant inhibition of esterase activity and a significant induction of antioxidant enzymes, indicating a response to an environmental challenge causing oxidative stress. Using principal components analysis, we could associate chlorpyrifos reduction in esterase activity with swimming alterations at 0.5 mg/L of the toxicant. The biochemical biomarkers reported in the present study respond at levels 20 times lower than the LC50-96h and were associated with a biologically important response-swimming behavior. The link of responses across different levels of biological organization was demonstrated. The species is suitable as a model for ecotoxicological studies at different levels, including the individual and biochemical levels, and may be considered a good reference organism in environmental control programs.

Although the need to confirm dosing solution concentrations is widely accepted, there are no experimental data to inform best practices when PFAS solutions are prepared.

AB Maternal transfer of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) confronts developing embryos with a pollution legacy and poses conservation concerns due to its potential impacts unto subsequent generations. We conducted a systematic review focusing on: 1) processes of POP maternal transfer, 2) challenges and opportunities to synthesizing current knowledge on POP concentrations in eggs, and 3) a meta-analysis of patterns in current egg pollution data. Results suggest selective maternal transfer of individual compounds. These relate to biological factors such as the foraging and remigration behavior, and to the selective mobilization of POPs during vitellogenesis, such as increased diffusion limitation for lipophilic POPs and slower release and higher reabsorption of apolar POPs. A key gap relates to knowledge of further selective toxicokinetics during embryonic development, as research to date has mainly focused on initial uptake into eggs. Challenges in the synthesis of current data on egg contamination profiles relate to methodological differences, varying analytical approaches, restricted data access, and reporting transparency among studies. To increase opportunities in the use of current data, we propose best practice guidelines, and synthesize a database on POP concentrations within sea turtle eggs. The meta-analysis revealed a geographical and taxonomic bias on the West Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, with most studies conducted on green turtles. Concentrations of POPs show temporal patterns related to trends in usage, production, release, and persistence in the environment, often with regional patterns. The trophic level has the potential to influence POP patterns with higher concentrations in loggerheads compared to other species, but this is confounded by temporal and geographic trends. We argue for more mechanistically process-focused and methodologically comparable research. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-21. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Vicuna is a wild, endangered species of Andean camelid living in the hyperarid Andean plateau. In the central part of the plateau, the Lithium Triangle defines a zone with lithium-rich salt pans. Brine pools naturally form within the salt pans, and the adaptation strategy of vicuna consists of drinking from brine pools. Together with reporting the first chemical data on vicuna bones and teeth, we analyzed lithium, boron, and arsenic in water and brines, with the aim of assessing their relation to chronic exposure by water ingestion. We collected and analyzed bones of vicuna specimens lying in an Andean salt pan, together with brine and water samples. Brine and water samples are highly saline and contain large amounts of lithium, boron, and arsenic. Lithium (13.50-40 mg kg(-1)) and boron (40-46.80 mg kg(-1)), but not arsenic, were found in the vicuna bones and teeth. Based on our results and on previously reported data on human tissues in the Andes, we conducted statistical assessments of the relationships between lithium and boron in body tissues and water samples, and discuss their environmental significance in the context of the Lithium Triangle.

AB Studies of the South Saskatchewan River confirmed that N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) is ubiquitous at 10 to 20 ng/L, whereas in effluent-dominated Wascana Creek, levels of 100 to 450 ng/L were observed. Effects of DEET exposure were assessed in microbial communities using a wide variety of measures. Communities developed in rotating annular reactors with either 100 or 500 ng/L DEET, verified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses. Microscale analyses indicated that both DEET concentrations resulted in significant (p < 0.05) declines in photosynthetic biomass, whereas bacterial biomass was unaffected. There was no detectable effect of DEET on the levels of chlorophyll a. However, pigment analyses indicated substantial shifts in algal-cyanobacterial community structure, with reductions of green algae and some cyanobacterial groups at 500 ng/L DEET. Protozoan/micrometazoan grazers increased in communities exposed to 500 ng/L, but not 100 ng/L, DEET. Based on thymidine incorporation or utilization of carbon sources, DEET had no significant effects on metabolic activities. Fluorescent lectin-binding analyses showed significant (p < 0.05) changes in glycoconjugate composition at both DEET concentrations, consistent with altered community structure. Principal component cluster analyses of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis indicated that DEET exposure at either concentration significantly changed the bacterial community (p < 0.05). Analyses based on 16S ribosomal RNA of community composition confirmed changes with DEET exposure, increasing detectable beta-proteobacteria, whereas actinobacteria and acidimicrobia became undetectable. Further, cyanobacteria in the subclass Oscillatoriophycideae were similarly not detected. Thus, DEET can alter microbial community structure and function, supporting the need for further evaluation of its effects in aquatic habitats. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-12.

AB Plant competitive interactions influence the effect of herbicides, and the effect of competitive interactions on plant responses may be important to include in the ecological risk assessment of herbicides. In the present study the effect of competitive interactions and sublethal doses of 2 herbicides on plant species was investigated in competition experiments and fitted to empirical competition models. Two nontarget species commonly found in agroecosystems (Centaurea cyanus L. and Silene noctiflora L.) and 2 herbicides (glyphosate and metsulfuron methyl) were used in separate experiments. Plants were sprayed at the 6- to 8-leaf stage. Effects of herbicide treatments and plant density were modeled by generalization of a discrete hyperbolic competition model. The 10% effective dose (ED10) was calculated for C. cyanus. All experiments showed that as density increased, plants were negatively affected. Furthermore, in all cases, C. cyanus remained a better competitor than S. noctiflora. Nevertheless, the density of S. noctiflora (competitor) was an influential element in determining the ED10 of C. cyanus measured at the mature stage. With herbicide exposure, the competitive interactions were further altered; C. cyanus was less affected by glyphosate when S. noctiflora increased to high density. In contrast, at the young stage, conspecific density was important in determining the sensitivity of C. cyanus to metsulfuron methyl, whereas the density of the competitor S. noctiflora had a limited influence. Overall, the results demonstrate the importance of integrating the effect of herbicide and species interactions measured at the reproductive stage into the ecological risk assessments of pesticides.

AB Pollution by heavy metals in river water is becoming a major subject of global drinking water concern, and the Xiangjiang River is one of the most heavily polluted rivers in China. Water samples were collected from 17 sites spanning the entire Xiangjiang watershed from 2005 to 2016 to investigate spatial-temporal distributions and potential human health risks related to 8 metal pollutants (As, Cd, Hg, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, and Se). The results of spatial-temporal distribution analyses proved that most metals were below the guideline limits the majority of the time. However, the hazard index and carcinogenic risk analyses indicated that As and Cr were associated with a potential risk of cancer, although noncarcinogenic heavy metals in general and carcinogenic risk declined year by year. A nonparametric seasonal Mann-Kendall's test revealed that there were notable decreasing trends in As, Cd, Zn, Cu, Cr, and Pb for most sites, whereas Se and Hg significantly increased in some areas over the targeted 12 yr. The results of principal component analysis agreed with those of dual hierarchical cluster analysis in the identification of pollution sources, the results of which are as follows: 1) As, Cd, Pb, Hg, and Zn were mainly derived from anthropogenic activities and the smelting industry; 2) Cr and Cu mainly originated from agricultural or industrial activities; and 3) Se was predominantly from natural erosion. The present study will be conducive to optimizing the distribution of water monitoring stations and drafting remediation strategies pertaining to the protection of public health in metal-polluted areas.

AB Fluvalinate has been extensively used in the United States to combat honey bee colony loss due to Varroa destructor mites. Our objectives were to investigate the extent of fluvalinate contamination in commercially available wax and to define exposure pathways to larval and adult honey bees. All the commercial wax tested contained elevated fluvalinate concentrations, indicating a need for regulation of the sources of wax being rendered for resale. Based on the negative logarithm of the partition coefficient between wax and pollen (-0.54), it is evident that fluvalinate has the potential to actively transfer from the contaminated wax into hive matrices. This was confirmed by adding fluvalinate-dosed wax, fluvalinate-impregnated strips, or a combination of the 2 to hives. Larvae and adult bees were checked for fluvalinate exposure using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Larvae had detectable concentrations of fluvalinate in all treatments. Bioaccumulation in adult bees was significantly affected by the interaction between treatment type and application time. In other words, residues from hives that only had fluvalinate-dosed wax were comparable to residues in hives that were actively being treated, suggesting that transfer of fluvalinate from wax into adult bees was an important exposure route. In conclusion, exposure of fluvalinate from contaminated wax and treatment strips to honey bees needs to be considered when the risk for colony loss in hives is being evaluated.

AB Because dietary consumption of fish is often a major vector of human exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), much effort is directed toward a quantitative understanding of fish bioaccumulation using mechanistic models. However, many such models fail to explicitly consider how uptake and loss rate constants relate to fish physiology. We calculated the bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of hypothetical POPs, with octanol-water partition coefficients ranging from 10(4.5) to 10(8.5), in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) with a food-web bioaccumulation model that uses bioenergetics to ensure that physiological parameters applied to a species are internally consistent. We modeled fish in 6 Canadian lakes (Great Slave Lake, Lake Ontario, Source Lake, Happy Isle Lake, Lake Opeongo, and Lake Memphremagog) to identify the factors that cause the BAFs of differently sized lake trout to vary between and within lakes. When comparing differently sized lake trout within a lake, larger fish tend to have the highest BAF because they allocate less energy toward growth than smaller fish and have higher activity levels. When comparing fish from different lakes, the model finds that diet composition and prey energy density become important in determining the BAF, in addition to activity and the amount of total energy allocated to growth.

Many of the effects of TCDD-like chemicals are induced through interaction with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. The present study indicates that mink dosed with beta-naphthoflavone, which is an aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand but not a TCDD-like chemical, also develop the lesion.

AB Extensive industrial areas in headwater stream watersheds can severely impact the physical condition of streams and introduce contaminants. We compared 3 streams that received stormwater runoff and industrial effluents from industrial complexes to 2 reference streams. Reference streams provide a benchmark of comparison of geomorphic form and stability in coastal plain, sandy-bottomed streams as well as concentrations of trace elements in sediment and biota in the absence of industrial disturbance. We used crayfish (Cambarus latimanus, Procambarus raneyi, Procambarus acutus) and crane fly larvae (Tipula) as biomonitors of 15 trace elements entering aquatic food webs. Streams with industrial areas were more scoured, deeply incised, and less stable. Sediment organic matter content broadly correlated to trace element accumulation, but fine sediments and organic matter were scoured from the bottoms of disturbed streams. Trace element concentrations were higher in depositional zones than runs within all streams. Despite contaminant sources in the headwaters, trace element concentrations were generally not elevated in sediments of the eroded streams. However, element concentrations were frequently elevated in biota from these streams with taxonomic differences in accumulation amplified. In eroded, sand-bottomed coastal plain streams with unstable sediments, single snapshots of sediment trace element concentrations did not characterize well bioavailable trace elements. Biota that integrated exposures over time and space within their home ranges better detected bioavailable contaminants than sediment. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:115-131. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Although the effects of nano-sized titania (nTiO(2)) on hatching events (change in hatching time and total hatching) in zebrafish have been reported, additional consequences of nTiO(2) exposure (i.e., the effects of nTiO(2)-induced changes in hatching events and morphometric parameters on embryo-larvae development and survivability) have not been reported. To address this knowledge gap, embryos 4 h postfertilization were exposed to nTiO(2) (0, 0.01, 10, and 1000 mu g/mL) for 220 h. Hatching rate (58, 82, and 106 h postexposure [hpe]), survival rate (8 times from 34 to 202 hpe), and 21 morphometric characteristics (8 times from 34 to 202 hpe) were recorded. Total hatching (rate at 106 hpe) was significantly and positively correlated to survival rate, but there was no direct association between nTiO(2)-induced change in hatching time (hatching rate at 58 and 82 hpe) and survival rate. At 58, 82, and 106 hpe, morphometric characteristics were significantly correlated to hatching rate, suggesting that the nTiO(2)-induced change in hatching time can affect larval development. The morphometric characteristics that were associated with change in hatching time were also significantly correlated to survival rate, suggesting an indirect significant influence of the nTiO(2)-induced change in hatching time on survivability. These results show a significant influence of nTiO(2)-induced change in hatching events on zebrafish embryo-larvae development and survivability. They also show that morphometric maldevelopments can predict later-in-life consequences (survivability) of an embryonic exposure to nTiO(2). This suggests that zebrafish can be sensitive biological predictors of nTiO(2) acute toxicity. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:3063-3076. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB The fathead minnow fish embryo toxicity (FET) test has been proposed as a more humane alternative to current toxicity testing methods as younger organisms are thought to experience less distress during toxicant exposure. However, the FET test protocol does not include endpoints that allow for the prediction of sublethal adverse outcomes, limiting its utility relative to other test types. Researchers have proposed the development of sublethal endpoints for the FET test to increase its utility. The present study 1) developed methods for previously unmeasured sublethal metrics in fathead minnows (i.e., spontaneous contraction frequency and heart rate) and 2) investigated the responsiveness of several sublethal endpoints related to growth (wet wt, length, and growth-related gene expression), neurodevelopment (spontaneous contraction frequency, eye size, and neurodevelopmental gene expression), and cardiovascular function and development (pericardial area, heart rate, and cardiovascular system-related gene expression) as additional FET test metrics using the model toxicant 3,4-dichloroaniline. Of the growth, neurological, and cardiovascular endpoints measured, length, eye size, and pericardial area were found to be more responsive than the other endpoints evaluated. Future studies linking alterations in these endpoints to longer-term adverse impacts are needed to fully evaluate the predictive power of these metrics in chemical and whole-effluent toxicity testing.

AB Development of an acute oral toxicity test with a terrestrial-phase amphibian was considered necessary to remove the uncertainty within the field of agrochemical risk assessments. The bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) was selected for use as it is a representative of the family Ranidae and historically this species has been used as an amphibian test model species. Prior to definitive study, oral gavage methods were developed with fenthion and tetraethyl pyrophosphate. Dimethoate and malathion were subsequently tested with both male and female juvenile bullfrogs in comprehensive acute oral median lethal dose (LD50) studies. Juvenile bullfrogs were administered a single dose of the test article via oral gavage of a single gelatin capsule of dimethoate technical (dimethoate) or neat liquid Fyfanon (R) Technical (synonym malathion), returned to their respective aquaria, and monitored for survival for 14 d. The primary endpoint was mortality, whereas behavioral responses, food consumption, body weight, and snout-vent length (SVL) were used to evaluate indications of sublethal toxicity (secondary endpoints). Acute oral LD50 values (95% fiducial interval) for dimethoate were 1459 (1176-1810, males) and 1528 (1275-1831, females), and for malathion they were 1829 (1480-2259, males) and 1672 (1280-2183, females) mg active substance/kg body weight, respectively. Based on the results of these studies, the methodology for the acute oral gavage administration of test items to terrestrial-phase amphibians was demonstrated as being a practical method of providing data for risk assessments.

AB The use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in consumer products such as textiles leads to their discharge into wastewater and consequently to a transfer of the AgNPs to soil ecosystems via biosolids used as fertilizer. In urban wastewater systems (e.g., sewer, wastewater treatment plant [WWTP], anaerobic digesters) AgNPs are efficiently converted into sparingly soluble silver sulfides (Ag2S), mitigating the toxicity of the AgNPs. However, long-term studies on the bioavailability and effects of sulfidized AgNPs on soil microorganisms are lacking. Thus we investigated the bioavailability and long-term effects of AgNPs (spiked in a laboratory WWTP) on soil microorganisms. Before mixing the biosolids into soil, the sludges were either anaerobically digested or directly dewatered. The effects on the ammonium oxidation process were investigated over 140 d. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) suggested an almost complete sulfidation of the AgNPs analyzed in all biosolid samples and in soil, with Ag2S predominantly detected in long-term incubation experiments. However, despite the sulfidation of the AgNPs, soil ammonium oxidation was significantly inhibited, and the degree of inhibition was independent of the sludge treatment. The results revealed that AgNPs sulfidized under environmentally relevant conditions were still bioavailable to soil microorganisms. Consequently, Ag2S may exhibit toxic effects over the long term rather than the short term. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3305-3313. (c) 2017 The Authors.

AB The scientific consensus model USEtox((R)) has been developed since 2003 under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme-Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry Life Cycle Initiative as a harmonized approach for characterizing human and freshwater toxicity in life cycle assessment and other comparative assessment frameworks. Using physicochemical substance properties, USEtox quantifies potential human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity impacts by combining environmental fate, exposure, and toxicity effects information, considering multimedia fate and multipathway exposure processes. The main source to obtain substance properties for USEtox 1.01 and 2.0 is the Estimation Program Interface (EPI Suite) from the US Environmental Protection Agency. However, since the development of the original USEtox substance databases, new chemical regulations have been enforced in Europe, such as the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and the Plant Protection Products regulations. These regulations require that a chemical risk assessment for humans and the environment is performed before a chemical is placed on the European market. Consequently, additional physicochemical property data and new toxicological endpoints are now available for thousands of chemical substances. The aim of the present study was to explore the extent to which the new available data can be used as input for USEtoxespecially for application in environmental footprint studiesand to discuss how this would influence the quantification of fate and exposure factors. Initial results show that the choice of data source and the parameters selected can greatly influence fate and exposure factors, leading to potentially different rankings and relative contributions of substances to overall human toxicity and ecotoxicity impacts. Moreover, it is crucial to discuss the relevance of the exposure factor for freshwater ecotoxicity impacts, particularly for persistent highly adsorbing and bioaccumulating substances.

AB The incidence of microplastics in marine environments has been increasing over the past several decades. The objective of the present study was to characterize the size- and shape-dependent effects of microplastic particles (spheres, fibers, and fragments) on the adult daggerblade grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio). Grass shrimp were exposed to 11 sizes of plastic: spheres (30, 35, 59, 75, 83, 116, and 165m), fragments (34 and 93m), and fibers (34 and 93m) at a concentration of 2000particles/400mL (=50000 particles/L) for 3h. Following exposure, grass shrimp were monitored for survival, ingested and ventilated microplastics, and residence time. Mortality ranged from 0% to 55%. Spheres and fragments <50m were not acutely toxic. Mortality rates in experiments with spheres and fragments >50m ranged from 5% to 40%. Mortality was significantly higher in the exposure to 93-m fibers than other sizes tested (p<0.001). The shape of the particle had a significant influence on the number of particles ingested by the shrimp (p<0.001). The residence time of particles in the gut ranged from 27 to 75h, with an average of 43.0 +/- 13.8h. Within the gills, the residence time ranged from 27 to 45h, with an average of 36.9 +/- 5.4h. The results suggest that microplastic particles of various sizes and shapes can be ingested and ventilated by adult daggerblade grass shrimp, resulting in acute toxicity.

AB In Argentina, glyphosate use has increased exponentially in recent years as a result of the widespread adoption of no-till management combined with genetically modified glyphosate-resistant crops. This massive use of glyphosate has created concern about its potential environmental impact. Sorption-desorption of glyphosate was studied in 3 Argentinean soils with contrasting characteristics. Glyphosate sorption isotherms were modeled using the Freundlich equation to estimate the sorption coefficient (K-f). Glyphosate sorption was high, and the K-f varied from 115.6 to 1612 mg(1-1/n)L(1/n)/kg. Cerro Azul soil had the highest glyphosate sorption capacity as a result of a combination of factors such as higher clay content, cation exchange capacity, total iron, and aluminum oxides, and lower available phosphorus and pH. Desorption isotherms were also modeled using the Freundlich equation. In general, desorption was very low (< 12%). The low values of hysteresis coefficient confirm that glyphosate strongly sorbs to the soils and that it is almost an irreversible process. Anguil soil had a significantly higher desorption coefficient (K-fd) than the other soils, associated with its lower clay content and higher pH and phosphorus. Glyphosate high sorption and low desorption to the studied soils may prevent groundwater contamination. However, it may also affect its bioavailability, increasing its persistence and favoring its accumulation in the environment. The results of the present study contribute to the knowledge and characterization of glyphosate retention in different soils. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Sediments are believed to be a major sink for silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the aquatic environment, but there is a lack of knowledge about the environmental effects and behavior of AgNPs in sediments. The release of highly toxic Ag+ through dissolution of AgNPs is one mechanism leading to toxic effects in sediments. We applied an ultrasound-assisted sequential extraction method to evaluate the dissolution of AgNPs and to study the partitioning of dissolved Ag in sediments. Silver was spiked into artificial and 2 natural sediments (Lake Hoytiainen sediment and Lake Kuorinka sediment) as silver nitrate (AgNO3), uncoated AgNPs, or polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated AgNPs (PVP-AgNPs). In addition, the total body burdens of Ag in the sediment-dwelling oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus were assessed over a 28-d exposure period. The dissolution rate was found to be similar between the uncoated AgNP and PVP-AgNP groups. In all sediments, dissolved Ag was mainly bound to the residual fraction of the sediment, followed by iron and manganese oxides or natural organic matter. In Lake Kuorinka sediment, dissolved Ag that originated from PVP-AgNPs was relatively more bioaccessible, also resulting in higher total body burden in L. variegatus than that from uncoated AgNPs or AgNO3. In artificial sediment and Lake Hoytiainen sediment, AgNO3 was significantly more bioaccessible than AgNPs. Our results highlight the importance of sediment properties and AgNP surface chemistry when evaluating the environmental exposure of AgNPs. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are among the most widely detected pharmaceuticals in surface water worldwide. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac is used to treat many types of pain and inflammation. Diclofenac's potential to cause adverse effects in exposed wildlife is a growing concern. To evaluate the effects of waterborne diclofenac on the immune response in Rhamdia quelen (South American catfish), fish were exposed to 3 concentrations of diclofenac (0.2, 2.0, and 20.0 mu g/L) for 14 d. Some of the exposed fish were also given an intraperitoneal injection on day 14 of 1 mg/kg of carrageenan to evaluate cell migration to the peritoneum. Total blood leukocyte count and carrageenan-induced leukocyte migration to the peritoneal cavity, particularly of polymorphonuclear cells, were significantly affected for all diclofenac exposure groups. Nitric oxide production was significantly reduced in the diclofenac-treated fish. Plasma and kidney proteins were analyzed by means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in a shotgun proteomic approach. In both plasma and kidney of diclofenac-exposed R. quelen, the expression of 20 proteins related to the inflammatory process, nitric oxide production, leukocyte migration, and the complement cascade was significantly altered. In addition, class I major histocompatibility complex was significantly decreased in plasma of diclofenac-treated fish. Thus, waterborne exposure to diclofenac could lead to suppression of the innate immune system in R. quelen. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Environmental toxicologists and chemists have been crucial to evaluating the chemical fate and toxicological effects of environmental contaminants, including chlorinated pesticides, before and after Rachel Carson's publication of Silent Spring in 1962. Like chlorinated pesticides previously, global climate change is widely considered to be one of the most important environmental challenges of our time. Over the past 30 yr, climate scientists and modelers have shown that greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 cause radiative forcing (climate forcing) and lead to increased global temperatures. Despite significant climate change research efforts worldwide, the climate science community has overlooked potential problems associated with chemical contaminants, in particular how climate change could magnify the ecological consequences of their use and disposal. It is conceivable that the impacts of legacy or new chemical contaminants on wildlife and humans may be exacerbated when climate changes, especially if global temperatures rise as predicted. This lack of attention to chemical contaminants represents an opportunity for environmental toxicologists and chemists to become part of the global research program, and our objective is to highlight the importance of and ways for that to occur.

AB Although chemical risk assessment is still mainly conducted on a substance-by-substance basis, organisms in the environment are typically exposed to mixtures of substances. Risk assessment procedures should therefore be adapted to fit these situations. Four mixture risk assessment methodologies were compared for risk estimations of mixtures of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and nickel (Ni). The results showed that use of the log-normal species sensitivity distribution (SSD) instead of the best-fit distribution and sampling species sensitivities independently for each metal instead of using interspecies correlations in metal sensitivity had little impact on risk estimates. Across 4 different monitoring datasets, between 0% and 52% of the target water samples were estimated to be at risk, but only between 0% and 15% of the target water samples were at risk because of the mixture of metals and not any single metal individually. When a natural baseline database was examined, it was estimated that 10% of the target water samples were at risk because of single metals or their mixtures; when the most conservative method was used (concentration addition [CA] applied directly to the SSD, i.e., CA(SSD)). However, the issue of metal mixture risk at geochemical baseline concentrations became relatively small (2% of target water samples) when a theoretically more correct method was used (CA applied to individual dose response curves, i.e., CA(DRC)). Finally, across the 4 monitoring datasets, the following order of conservatism for the 4 methods was shown (from most to least conservative, with ranges of median margin of safety[MoS] relative to CA(SSD)): CA(SSD)> CA(DRC) (MoS-1.17-1.25)> IA(DRC) (independent action (IA) applied to individual dose-response curves; MoS=1.38-1.60)> IA(SSD) (MoS=1.48-1.72). Therefore, it is suggested that these 4 methods can be used in a general tiered scheme for the risk assessment of metal mixtures in a regulatory context. In this scheme, the CA(SSD) method could serve as a first (conservative) tier to identify situations with likely no potential risk at all, regardless of the method used (the sum toxic unit expressed relative to the 5% hazardous concentration [SumTU(HC5)]< 1) and the IA(SSD) method to identify situations of potential risk, also regardless of the method used (the multisubstance potentially affected fraction of species using the IA(SSD) method [msPAF(IA,SSD)]> 0.05). The CA(DRC) and IA(DRC) methods could be used for site-specific assessment for situations that fall in between (SumT(UHC5)> 1 and msPAF(IA,SSD)< 0.05). Environ Toxicol Chem 2017; 36: 2123-2138.

AB Urban pest control insecticides-specifically fipronil and its 4 major degradates (fipronil sulfone, sulfide, desulfinyl, and amide), as well as imidacloprid-were monitored during drought conditions in 8 San Francisco Bay (San Francisco, CA, USA) wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In influent and effluent, ubiquitous detections were obtained in units of ng/L for fipronil (1388 ng/L), fipronil sulfone (1-28 ng/L), fipronil sulfide (1-5 ng/L), and imidacloprid (58-306 ng/L). Partitioning was also investigated; in influent, 100% of imidacloprid and 62 +/- 9% of total fiproles (fipronil and degradates) were present in the dissolved state, with the balance being bound to filter-removable particulates. Targeted insecticides persisted during wastewater treatment, regardless of treatment technology utilized (imidacloprid: 93 +/- 17%; total fiproles: 65 +/- 11% remaining), with partitioning into sludge (3.7-151.1 mg/kg dry wt as fipronil) accounting for minor losses of total fiproles entering WWTPs. The load of total fiproles was fairly consistent across the facilities but fiprole speciation varied. This first regional study on fiprole and imidacloprid occurrences in raw and treated California sewage revealed ubiquity and marked persistence to conventional treatment of both phenylpyrazole and neonicotinoid compounds. Flea and tick control agents for pets are identified as potential sources of pesticides in sewage meriting further investigation and inclusion in chemical-specific risk assessments. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB It is difficult to assess the toxicity of a single stressor and establish a strong stressor-causality link when multiple stressors coexist. Toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) methodology uses a series of chemical and physical manipulations to fractionate compounds within a matrix and systematically identify potential toxicants. The current US Environmental Protection Agency application of TIE can provide valuable information but often lacks ecological realism and is subject to laboratory-related artifacts. An in situ TIE device (iTIED) was designed to assess the sources of toxicity in aquatic ecosystems. For this laboratory validation, each unit was equipped with a sorbent resin chamber, an organism exposure chamber, a water collection container, and a peristaltic pump. Chemical analyses of water processed by each iTIED unit were compared with both lethal and sublethal molecular responses of the organisms. The compound removal effectiveness of different sorbent resins was also compared. In addition to successfully fractionating diverse chemical mixtures, the iTIED demonstrated a potential for early detection of molecular biomarkers, which could identify chronic toxicity that may go unnoticed in traditional TIE assays. Utilizing this novel in situ system will reduce the uncertainty associated with laboratory-based simulations and aid management efforts in targeting compounds that pose the greatest threat.

AB The role of milk in the transfer of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) to offspring is not well known in wildlife. Eight PFASs were quantified in plasma and milk in mother-pup pairs of hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) during the nursing period, and the role of milk in the transfer process was analyzed. Hooded seal was chosen because of its short lactation period (3-4d), during which the pup feeds only on milk. Placental or lactation transfer would thus be the only source of PFAS in the pup. Of the 8 PFASs analyzed (Sigma(8)PFAS), 7 were found in all samples; therefore, milk is a source to PFASs in pups. Perfluorooctane sulfonate was the dominant PFAS in all samples. Mean Sigma(8)PFAS concentrations were 6.0 ng/g protein (36 ng/g wet wt) in maternal plasma, 0.77 ng/g protein (3.2 ng/g wet wt) in milk, and 12 ng/g protein (66 ng/g wet wt) in pup plasma. Measured concentrations in plasma were within ranges previously reported from other seal species, below known toxicity thresholds for experimental rodents. Individual PFASs differed in transfer efficiency from mother to pup, depending on carbon chain lengths, with the lowest relative transfer for the intermediate-chained PFASs (C9-C10). The results show maternal transfer of PFASs via both milk and the placenta, of which placental transfer is the dominant pathway. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Posidonia oceanica mat is considered a long-term bioindicator of contamination. Storage and sequestration of trace elements and organic carbon (C-org) were assessed in dead P. oceanica mat and bare sediments from a highly polluted coastal marine area (Augusta Bay, central Mediterranean). Sediment elemental composition and sources of organic matter have been altered since the 1950s. Dead P. oceanica mat displayed a greater ability to bury and store trace elements and C-org than nearby bare sediments, acting as a long-term contaminant sink over the past 120yr. Trace elements, probably associated with the mineral fraction, were stabilized and trapped despite die-off of the overlying P. oceanica meadow. Mat deposits registered historic contamination phases well, confirming their role as natural archives for recording trace element trends in marine coastal environments. This sediment typology is enriched with seagrass-derived refractory organic matter, which acts mainly as a diluent of trace elements. Bare sediments showed evidence of inwash of contaminated sediments via reworking; more rapid and irregular sediment accumulation; and, because of the high proportions of labile organic matter, a greater capacity to store trace elements. Through different processes, both sediment typologies represent a repository for chemicals and may pose a risk to the marine ecosystem as a secondary source of contaminants in the case of sediment dredging or erosion.

AB Antarctic marine environments are at risk from petroleum fuel spills as shipping activities in the Southern Ocean increase. Knowledge of the sensitivity of Antarctic species to fuels under environmentally realistic exposure conditions is lacking. We determined the toxicity of 3 fuels, Special Antarctic Blend diesel (SAB), marine gas oil (MGO), and intermediate fuel oil (IFO 180) to a common Antarctic sea urchin, Sterechinus neumayeri. Sensitivity was estimated for early developmental stages from fertilization to the early 4-arm pluteus in toxicity tests of up to 24 d duration. The effects of the water accommodated fractions (WAFs) of fuels were investigated under different exposure scenarios to determine the relative sensitivity of stages and of different exposure regimes. Sensitivity to fuel WAFs increased through development. Both MGO and IFO 180 were more toxic than SAB, with median effect concentration values for the most sensitive pluteus stage of 3.5, 6.5, and 252 mu g/L total hydrocarbon content, respectively. Exposure to a single pulse during fertilization and early embryonic development showed toxicity patterns similar to those observed from continuous exposure. The results show that exposure to fuel WAFs during critical early life stages affects the subsequent viability of larvae, with consequent implications for reproductive success. The sensitivity estimates for S. neumayeri that we generated can be utilized in risk assessments for the management of Antarctic marine ecosystems. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-13. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Because zinc oxide (ZnO) nanomaterials are used in antifouling and antibacterial solutions, understanding their toxic effects on different aquatic organisms is essential. In the present study, we evaluated the toxicity of ZnO nanoparticles of 10 to 30 nm (ZnONPI) and 80 to 200 nm (ZnONPII), ZnO nanorods (width 80 nm, height 1.7 mu m) attached to the support substrate (glass, ZnONRG) and not attached (ZnONRS), as well as Zn2+ ions at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 100 mg/L. Toxicity was evaluated using the microalga Dunaliella salina, the brine shrimp Artemia salina, and the marine bacterium Bacillus cereus. The highest toxicity was observed for ZnONPs (median lethal concentration [LC50] similar to 15 mg/L) and Zn2+ ions (LC50 similar to 13 mg/L), whereas the lowest toxicity found for ZnO nanorods (ZnONRG LC50 similar to 60 mg/L; ZnONRS LC50 similar to 42 mg/L). The presence of the support substrate in case of ZnO nanorods reduced the associated toxicity to aquatic organisms. Smaller ZnONPs resulted in the highest Zn2+ ion dissolution among tested nanostructures. Different aquatic organisms responded differently to ZnO nanomaterials, with D. salina and B. cereus being more sensitive than A. salina. Toxicity of nanostructures increased with an increase of the dose and the time of exposure. Supported ZnO nanorods can be used as a low-toxicity alternative for future antimicrobial and antifouling applications. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-12. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Aquatic insects are poorly represented in water quality criteria, and previous studies have suggested a lack of sensitivity in acute toxicity tests despite observational studies demonstrating the contrary. Our objectives were to determine the toxicity of nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) to the mayfly Neocloeon triangulifer in fed acute (96-h) and chronic exposures to estimate aqueous effect concentrations while acknowledging the importance of dietary exposure for these insects. For the chronic tests, we conducted preliminary full-life cycle (25-30 d) and subchronic (14 d) exposures to compare the relative sensitivity of the 2 test durations under similar conditions (i.e., feeding rates). Observing similar sensitivity, we settled on 14 d as the definitive test duration. Furthermore, we conducted experiments to determine how much food could be added to a given volume of water while minimally impacting dissolved metal recovery; a ratio of food dry mass to water volume (<0.005) achieved this. In the 14-d tests, we obtained a median lethal concentration and most sensitive chronic endpoint of 147 and 23 mu g/L dissolved Ni (acute to chronic ratio [ACR] = 6.4), respectively, and 81 (mean value) and 10 mu g/L dissolved Zn (ACR = 8.1), respectively. The acute values are orders of magnitude lower than previously published values for mayflies, probably most importantly due to the presence of dietary exposure but also potentially with some influence of organism age and test temperature.

AB Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is an increasingly important environmental pollutant that is pervasive in the environment. A number of studies have focused on the toxicological effects of PFOS on model fish species (zebrafish and medaka), but little is known about the impact of PFOS on commercially important marine fish. Thus, the present study examined transcriptome responses to PFOS exposure in the liver of juvenile Cynoglossus semilaevis, an important farmed flatfish in China. Then, in response to PFOS challenges, 1695 and 5244 genes were identified as significantly increased and depressed, respectively. Significant expression changes were observed in immune-related genes (cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, T-helper [Th]17 cell differentiation, and the chemokine nuclear factor-kappa B and T-cell receptor signaling pathways), indicating that immunotoxicity is a key aspect of the effects of PFOS on C. semilaevis. Exposure to PFOS also altered the gene expression levels of hormones (inhibin, insulin, somatostatin, and glucagon), which could lead to severe metabolic and endocrine dysfunction. As expected from previous studies, several phase I and phase II detoxification enzymes were significantly up-regulated, which could facilitate the biotransformation and detoxification of PFOS in C. semilaevis. The present study provides new insights into the molecular toxicology of PFOS in a commercially important fish species. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-9. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Persistent organic pollutants reach aquatic ecosystems during application and can bioconcentrate/biomagnify because of their lipophilic nature. Toxicological studies focus almost exclusively on the active ingredients of pesticides, instead of commercial formulations, whose toxicity can differ as a result of nonspecified ingredients. The intensive use of endosulfan as a wide-ranging insecticide over the last few decades makes it one of the most frequently detected contaminants in the aquatic environment, even after it has been restricted worldwide. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the bioaccumulation and organ distribution of waterborne endosulfan in the freshwater fish Cichlasoma dimerus, comparing the active ingredient and a commercial formulation. Males were exposed to 0.7 mu g/L endosulfan for 2 wk, which was quantified (gas chromatography with an electron capture detector) in the liver, testes, gills, brain, and muscle. The results suggest rapid metabolism of alpha-endosulfan and beta-endosulfan isomers to endosulfan sulfate (endosulfan-S) in tissues. Isomer levels were highest in gills, indicative of recent uptake. Levels of endosulfan-S were highest in liver and testes for the active ingredient and testes and brain for the commercial formulation. For the active ingredient, endosulfan-S levels showed a positive correlation with organ-lipid percentage. No correlation was evident for the commercial formulation, indicating that the presence of adjuvants alters endosulfan distribution because gills and liver showed a higher uptake and mobilization of beta-endosulfan. These differences in organ distribution may alter tissue-specific toxicity; therefore, additives cannot be considered inactive even if nontoxic. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-8. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Widespread use of pesticides has resulted in the accumulation of pesticide residues in the environment due to their persistence and stability. To reduce potential exposures, we have developed broad-acting clay-based sorbents that can be included in the diet as enterosorbents to reduce the bioavailability and toxicity of chemicals. In the present study, parent and acid-processed calcium montmorillonite clays (CM and APM, respectively) were used to determine their potential as sorbents of the organochlorine insecticide dieldrin. We used adsorption isotherms, thermodynamics, and dosimetry studies to determine the capacities and affinities of the clays, the enthalpies of the binding reactions, and potential doses of sorbent that could protect against high exposures. Adsorption isotherms for APM fit a Langmuir model with high enthalpy (suggesting chemisorption) and high capacity (Q(max) value = 0.45 mol kg(-1)), indicating tight binding of dieldrin. Cultures of Hydra vulgaris were used to determine the ability of sorbents to protect a living organism from dieldrin toxicity. The inclusion of acid-processed clays resulted in the highest reduction of dieldrin toxicity (70%) in the hydra. Further work indicated that both CM and APM can significantly reduce the bioavailability of dieldrin from soil (p <= 0.01). These results suggest that APM (and similar clays) can be effective sorbents of dieldrin and may be included in the diet and/or soil to protect against environmental exposures.

AB Coal-related elements are toxic and persistent pollutants that have spread globally since the industrial revolution, mainly from point-source emissions. A sediment core was collected from Deep Lake in northeastern Washington State (USA) by the Washington State Department of Ecology, with the aim of assessing recent changes in atmospheric deposition in the US Pacific Northwest. The core was divided into depth intervals and dated by lead-210. A sample from each cross section was digested and analyzed for toxic metals and metalloids using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Data show recent increases in the concentrations of arsenic, barium, selenium, and mercury. Comparison with 1993 US Geological Survey ice core data from the Upper Fremont Glacier in Wyoming (USA), Asian coal consumption data, and weather patterns suggests that pollutant inputs to Deep Lake sediments are the result of coal-burning activities in the Asia-Pacific region. Most notably, mercury deposition in Deep Lake has increased from approximately 20 ppb in 1996 to 9470 ppb in 2014 (an similar to 400-fold increase), and since 1993 when the ice core was analyzed.

AB The main petroleum product transported through pipelines in Canada is diluted bitumen (dilbit), a semiliquid form of heavy crude oil mixed with natural gas condensates to facilitate transport. The weathering, fate, behavior, and environmental effects of dilbit are crucial to consider when responding to a spill; however, few environmental studies on dilbit have been completed. We report on 11-d-long experimental spills of dilbit (Cold Lake Winter Blend) in outdoor microcosms meant to simulate a low-energy aquatic system containing natural lake water and sediments treated with low (1:8000 oil:water) and high (1:800 oil:water) volumes of dilbit. In the first 24 h of the experiment, volatile hydrocarbons quickly evaporated from the dilbit, resulting in increased dilbit density and viscosity. These changes in dilbit's physical and chemical properties ultimately led to its submergence after 8 d. We also detected rapid accumulation of polycyclic aromatic compounds in the water column of the treated microcosms following the spills. The present study provides new information on the environmental fate and behavior of dilbit in a freshwater environment that will be critical to environmental risk assessments of proposed pipeline projects. In particular, the study demonstrates the propensity for dilbit to sink under ambient environmental conditions in freshwaters typical of many boreal lakes. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2621-2628.

AB Groundwater-surface water interactions in the hyporheic transition zone can influence contaminant exposure to benthic macroinvertebrates. In streams, hyporheic flows are subject to varying redox conditions, which influence biogeochemical cycling and metal speciation. Despite these relationships, little is known about how these interactions influence the ecological risk of contaminants. The present study investigated the effects of hyporheic flows and zinc (Zn)-contaminated sediments on the amphipod Hyalella azteca. Hyporheic flows were manipulated in laboratory streams during 10-d experiments. Zinc toxicity was evaluated in freshly spiked and aged sediments. Hyporheic flows altered sediment and porewater geochemistry, oxidizing the sediments and causing changes to redox-sensitive endpoints. Amphipod survival was lowest in the Zn sediment exposures with hyporheic flows. In freshly spiked sediments, porewater Zn drove mortality, whereas in aged sediments simultaneously extracted metals (SEM) in excess of acid volatile sulfides (AVS) normalized by the fraction of organic carbon (fOC) [(SEM-AVS)/fOC] influenced amphipod responses. The results highlight the important role of hyporheic flows in determining Zn bioavailability to benthic organisms, information that can be important in ecological risk assessments.

AB Biochar has frequently been used for the treatment of heavy metal pollution in water and soil; its effect on contaminated sediments requires further research. To improve the ability of biochar to immobilize heavy metals in sediment, we prepared a functionalized biochar/attapulgite composite by pyrolysis of the clay attapulgite and zinc chloride-pretreated rice straw biomass. Compared with the original biochar, the biochar/attapulgite composite had a large increase in specific surface area, pore volume, oxygen-containing functional groups, and cation exchange capacity. Biochar effectively improved the dispersibility of attapulgite as a matrix. The results showed that the biochar/attapulgite composite effectively reduced the bioavailable fraction of arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) in river sediment, which was a great improvement compared with the raw biochar. After the sediment was treated with different biochar/attapulgite composites, the concentrations of As and Cd in the overlying water and the porewater, and the content of acid-extractable and toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP)-extractable As and Cd in the solid phase of the sediment decreased significantly. Both zinc chloride activation and attapulgite improved As and Cd immobilization in sediment when we used the biochar/attapulgite composite. The results suggest that biochar/attapulgite composite can be used as an efficient in situ sorbent amendment to improve the heavy metal immobilization ability of the sediment.

AB We propose a framework on sample size for species sensitivity distribution (SSD) analyses, with perspectives on Bayesian, frequentist, and even nonparametric approaches to estimation. The intent of a statistical sample size analysis is to ensure that the implementation of a statistical model will satisfy a minimum performance standard when relevant conditions are met. It requires that a statistical model be fully specified and that the means of measuring its performance as a function of sample size be detailed. Defining the model conditions under which sample size is calculated is often the most difficult, and important, aspect of sample size analysis because if the model is not representative, then the sample size analysis will provide incorrect guidance. Definitive guidance on sample size requires general agreement on representative models and their performance from stakeholders in important domains such as chemical safety assessments involving government regulators and industry; the present study provides an initial framework that could be used to this end in the future. In addition, our analysis provides immediate value for understanding how well current SSD analyses perform under a few basic models, sample sizes, and quantitative performance criteria. The results confirm that many analyses are adequately sized to estimate hazardous concentration percentile values (typically the 5th percentile for chemical hazard assessments). However, on the low end of sizes seen in common practice, hazardous concentration estimates can be more than 1 order of magnitude greater than the model-defined value.

AB The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) test guideline 236 (fish embryo acute toxicity test; 2013) relies on 4 endpoints to describe exposure-related effects (coagulation, lack of somite formation, tail-bud detachment from the yolk sac, and the presence of a heartbeat). Danio rerio (zebrafish) embryos were used to investigate these endpoints along with a number of additional sublethal effects (cardiac dysfunction, pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, tail curvature, hatch success, pericardial edema area, craniofacial malformation, swim bladder development, fin development, and heart rate) following 5-d exposures to 7 petroleum substances. The substances investigated included 2 crude oils, 3 gas oils, a diluted bitumen, and a petrochemical containing a mixture of branched alcohols. Biomimetic extraction-solid-phase microextraction (BE-SPME) was used to quantify freely dissolved concentrations of test substances as the exposure metric. The results indicated that the most prevalent effects observed were pericardial and yolk sac edema, tail curvature, and lack of embryo viability. A BE-SPME threshold was determined to characterize sublethal morphological alterations that preceded embryo mortality. Our results aid in the understanding of aquatic hazards of petroleum substances to developing zebrafish beyond traditional OECD test guideline 236 endpoints and show the applicability of BE-SPME as a simple analytical tool that can be used to predict sublethal embryo toxicity.

AB Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have left a legacy of environmental contamination. Even though they were banned from production and active use in the 1970s, they persist in the environment and still have the potential to impact aquatic life. Our objective was to identify data from controlled laboratory studies of PCB-related adverse effects in fish and to conduct a meta-analysis on mortality, growth, and reproductive (MGR) threshold responses. For each endpoint type, we compiled data on the lowest-observed-adverse effect concentration (LOAEC) and the degree of effect at the LOAEC as a percentage of control. The LOAECs were expressed as tissue concentrations, so the term lowest-observed-adverse-effect residue concentration (LOAER) was used to represent PCB exposures. The lower limit of applicability was set at 0.1 mu g/g total PCB tissue concentration, below which adverse MGR effects in fish were not supported by the data. Sensitivity distributions identifying the probability of adverse effects in fish populations or communities predicted that 25% of fish species would be impacted between 0.1 and 7.5 mu g/g. Concentration-response threshold regressions were developed from the MGR datasets. For example, a 1 mu g/g total PCB tissue concentration would predict effects of 17% mortality, 15% growth, and 39% reproductive. The analysis determined the degree of adverse response, with uncertainty estimates, expected across a broad range of PCB tissue exposure concentrations in fish. Data generated from MGR endpoints were combined to determine an approach for overall effect thresholds for PCB-related injury in fish. The MGR datasets included only laboratory data; however, responses were compared with field-observed effects. The present review provides a comprehensive assessment of PCB-induced injury in fish utilizing a data-inclusive approach. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:712-736.

AB Double-crested cormorants are piscivorous birds that breed in variably contaminated colonies across the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America. Collection and preparation of environmentally relevant extracts from eggs that contain variable concentrations of organohalogen contaminants represents a minimally invasive approach to characterize potential effects of exposure using in vitro bioassays. In the present study, a rapid, efficient lipid freeze-filtration extraction method was used to prepare extracts from double-crested cormorant eggs collected from 5 breeding colonies that had variable organohalogen contaminant burdens. Extracts, solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide, were administered to chicken embryonic hepatocytes (CEHs) to determine effects on cell viability, 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, and messenger RNA expression using a chicken ToxChip polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array. The EROD median effect concentration (EC50) values were lower for extracts with greater organohalogen contaminant burdens and thus permitted an initial ranking of colonies based on the efficacy of eliciting an aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated response. The ToxChip PCR array data provided a more exhaustive, pathway-based evaluation of extract effects; variability in the transcriptomic profiles was associated with organohalogen contaminant burdens. For example, extracts from Mud Island (Detroit River, MI, USA) had among the highest organohalogen contaminant burdens and elicited a greater biochemical (EROD EC50 = 0.005) and transcriptomic response (22/43 genes altered on the array) in CEHs compared with the least contaminated site, which was Mandarte Island (BC, Canada; EROD EC50 = 0.172; 8/43 genes altered). Avian eggs represent a useful biomonitoring tool for determining complex mixture effects, and the combination of a rapid extraction method, an in vitro bioassay, and targeted endpoint evaluation (biochemical and transcriptomic) shows great promise as an environmental effects monitoring approach.

AB The bioavailability and bioaccumulation of sedimentary hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) is of concern at contaminated sites. Passive samplers have emerged as a promising tool to measure the bioavailability of sedimentary HOCs and possibly to estimate their bioaccumulation. We thus analyzed HOCs including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs) in sediment, porewater, and river water using low-density polyethylene passive samplers and in 11 different finfish species and blue crab from the lower Passaic River. In addition, perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAAs) were measured in grab water samples, sediment, and fish. Best predictors of bioaccumulation in biota were either porewater concentrations (for PCBs and OCPs) or sediment organic carbon (PBDEs and PFAAs), including black carbon (OCPs, PCBs, and some PCDD/F congeners)-normalized concentrations. Measured lipid-based concentrations of the majority of HOCs exceeded the chemicals' activities in porewater by at least 2-fold, suggesting dietary uptake. Trophic magnification factors were >1 for moderately hydrophobic analytes (log octanol-water partitioning coefficient [K-OW] = 6.5-8.2) with low metabolic transformation rates (<0.01 d(-1)), including longer alkyl chain PFAAs. For analytes with lower (4.5-6.5) and higher (>8.2) K(OW)s, metabolic transformation was more important in reducing trophic magnification. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:872-882. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB 4-nonylphenol is a persistent organic pollutant with endocrine-disrupting properties. A nonpolar product of microbial degradation derived from the surfactant nonylphenol polyethoxylate, 4-nonylphenol is capable of long-range transport attached to particulates. Bioactive concentrations of 4-nonylphenol have been found in the surface water, soils, snow, and particulate matter of the Eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains (USA) hundreds of miles from their origins. As a result of particulate deposition, seasonal and glacial snow pack concentrations measured 20 to 100 times higher than in surface waters. Batch desorption assays were run on particulate matter dosed with 4-nonylphenol. Desorption was measured in 63 to 500 mu m particles under 2 different temperature conditions with varying fractions of organic carbon in turbulent or undisturbed states. Lower temperatures (4 degrees C) decreased the mean percentage of 4-nonylphenol released from particulates in disturbed and undisturbed conditions, whereas the mean percentage of 4-nonylphenol released at 20 degrees C was reduced by agitation. The effect of agitation at 4 degrees C was not practically or statistically significant. Particulates with a higher percentage of organic carbon (75%) released very little of the bound 4-nonylphenol (0.53%) compared with particulates containing 4 to 5% of organic carbon that released up to 13%. Larger particles released the least amount of 4-nonylphenol, whereas smaller particles released the most amount. Water and sediment samples taken from below the Palisades Glacier in the Sierra Nevada Mountains showed the greatest 4-nonylphenol concentrations directly below the glacier, implying that glacial particulates will release adsorbed 4-nonylphenol.

AB Pharmaceuticals are essential for human well-being, but their increasing and continuous use pollutes the environment. Although behavioral ecotoxicology is increasingly advocated to assess the effects of pharmaceutical pollution on wildlife and ecosystems, a consensus on the actual environmental risks is lacking for most compounds. The main limitation is the lack of standardized reproducible tests that are based on sensitive behavioral endpoints and that accommodate a high ecological relevance. In the present study, we assessed the impact of a 3-wk exposure to the antidepressant fluoxetine on multiple behavioral traits in the promising new model organism Nothobranchius furzeri (turquoise killifish). Overall, our study shows that fluoxetine can impact feeding behavior, habitat choice in a novel environment, and antipredator response of N. furzeri individuals; effects on spontaneous activity and exploration tendency were less pronounced. However, effects became only apparent when individuals were exposed to fluoxetine concentrations that were 10 times higher than typical concentrations in natural aquatic environments. Ecotoxicologists are challenged to maximize both the reliability and ecological validity of risk assessments of pollutants. Our study contributes to the development of a time- and cost-efficient, standardized ecotoxicological test based on sensitive, ecologically relevant behavioral endpoints in N. furzeri.

AB It is well known that copper (Cu) is toxic to marine organisms. We measured and compared the acute toxicity of several forms of Cu (including nanoCu) amended into a marine sediment with mysids and amphipods. For all the forms of Cu tested, toxicity, measured as the median lethal concentration, ranged from 708 to > 2400mg Cu/kg (dry sediment) for mysids and 258 to 1070mg Cu/kg (dry sediment) for amphipods.

   PARTICULATE MATTER
AB Trenbolone acetate is widely used in some parts of the world for its desirable anabolic effects on livestock. Several metabolites of the acetate, including 17-trenbolone, have been detected at low nanograms per liter concentrations in surface waters associated with animal feedlots. The 17-trenbolone isomer can affect androgen receptor signaling pathways in various vertebrate species at comparatively low concentrations/doses. The present article provides a comprehensive review and synthesis of the existing literature concerning exposure to and biological effects of 17-trenbolone, with an emphasis on potential risks to aquatic animals. In vitro studies indicate that, although 17-trenbolone can activate several nuclear hormone receptors, its highest affinity is for the androgen receptor in all vertebrate taxa examined, including fish. Exposure of fish to nanograms per liter water concentrations of 17-trenbolone can cause changes in endocrine function in the short term, and adverse apical effects in longer exposures during development and reproduction. Impacts on endocrine function typically are indicative of inappropriate androgen receptor signaling, such as changes in sex steroid metabolism, impacts on gonadal stage, and masculinization of females. Exposure of fish to 17-trenbolone during sexual differentiation in early development can greatly skew sex ratios, whereas adult exposures can adversely impact fertility and fecundity. To fully assess ecosystem-level risks, additional research is warranted to address uncertainties as to the degree/breadth of environmental exposures and potential population-level effects of 17-trenbolone in sensitive species.

AB Risk assessment of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) is critically affected by the concern that toxicity goes beyond that of the metallic ion. The present study addressed this concern for soils with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using the Ag-sensitive nitrification assay. Three agricultural soils (A, B, and C) were spiked with equivalent doses of either AgNP (diameter=13nm) or AgNO3. Soil solution was isolated and monitored over 97 d with due attention to accurate Ag fractionation at low (approximate to 10gL(-1)) Ag concentrations. Truly dissolved (<1kDa) Ag in the AgNO3-amended soils decreased with reaction half-lives of 4 to 22 d depending on the soil, denoting important Ag-aging reactions. In contrast, truly dissolved Ag in AgNP-amended soils first increased by dissolution and subsequently decreased by aging, the concentration never exceeding that in the AgNO3-amended soils. The half-lives of AgNP transformation-dissolution were approximately 4 d (soils A and B) and 36 d (soilC). The Ag toxic thresholds (10% effect concentrations, milligrams of Ag per kilogram of soil) of nitrification, evaluated at 21 or 35 d after spiking, were similar between the 2 Ag forms (soils A and B) but were factors of 3 to 8 lower for AgNO3 than for AgNP (soilC), largely corroborating dissolution differences. This fate and bioassay showed that AgNPs are not more toxic than AgNO3 at equivalent total soil Ag concentrations and that differences in Ag dissolution at least partially explain toxicity differences between the forms and among soils.

AB Humans are altering environments by destroying habitats, introducing species, and releasing pollution. One emergent pollutant is the salinization of freshwater habitats from road-deicing salts. Government agencies have set thresholds to protect freshwater ecosystems, yet these values are exceeded in many systems. The present study investigated the tolerance of Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea), a common invasive bivalve, to the common road salt (sodium chloride [NaCl]) and 2 alternatives (magnesium chloride [MgCl2] and calcium chloride [CaCl2]). Experiments conducted at 4 and 8 d revealed that Asian clams are very salt tolerant. The median lethal concentration after 4 d of exposure (LC50(4-d)) estimate was 2162mg Cl-/L for MgCl2, 3554mg Cl-/L for CaCl2, and more than 22581mg Cl-/L for NaCl, which were all significantly different from each other (p0.05). The LC50(8-d) values were significantly different (p0.05) from each other and from the LC50(4-d) values, and were estimated to be 1769mg Cl-/L for MgCl2, 2235 Cl-/L for CaCl2, and 10069mg Cl-/L for NaCl. Mortality was determined using 2 methods: either no response after exposure or no response after being in freshwater following exposure. For the majority of the LC50s, these methods were not significantly different (p>0.05). The high salt tolerance of Asian clams is a concern because of their transportation in ballast water between aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, salt-tolerant organisms may outcompete sensitive organisms in salinized ecosystems, which may alter ecosystem services. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:1839-1845. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Biomolecules involved in handling cytosolic metals in the liver of the yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were characterized in juvenile fish collected from 4 lakes constituting metal contamination gradients. Using size-exclusion liquid chromatography coupled to an inductively coupled mass spectrometer, we determined metal distributions among ligands of different molecular weights in the cytosol, before and after a heat denaturation step designed to isolate metallothionein-like peptides and proteins. Silver, Cd, and Cu found in the heat-stable protein supernatants were indeed largely present as metallothionein-like peptide complexes; but Co, Ni, and Tl, also present in the heat-stable protein supernatants, did not coelute with metallothionein-like peptides and proteins. This difference in metal partitioning is consistent with the known preference of "soft" metals such as Ag, Cd, and Cu(I) for thiolated ligands and the contrasting tendency of Co and Ni to bind to ligands with oxygen and nitrogen as donor atoms. Metal handling in the whole cytosol also reflected these differences in metal-binding behavior. For Cd and Cu, the importance of the molecular weight pool that includes metallothionein-like peptides and proteins increased relative to the other pools as the total cytosolic metal concentration ([M](cytosol)) increased, consistent with a concentration-dependent detoxification response. In contrast, for Ni and Tl the increase in [M](cytosol) was accompanied by a marked increase in the high-molecular weight (670-33 kDa) pool, suggesting that hepatic Ni and Tl are not effectively detoxified. Overall, the results suggest that metal detoxification is less effective for Ni, Tl, and Co than for Ag, Cd, and Cu. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Provisional molecular weights and chemical formulas were assigned to 4 significant previously unidentified contaminants present during active fish kills in the Red River region of Oklahoma. The provisional identifications of these contaminants were determined using high-resolution liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS), LC-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (LC-FTICRMS), and LC-ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-ITMS). Environmental water samples were extracted using a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method, and sediment samples were extracted using a modified sonication liquid extraction method. During screening of the samples, 2 major unknown chromatographic peaks were detected at m/z 624.3 and m/z 639.3. The peak at m/z 639.3 was firmly identified, through the use of an authentic standard, as a porphyrin, specifically chlorin-e6-trimethyl ester, with m/z 639.31735 (M+H)(+) and molecular formula C37H43N4O6. The other major peak, at m/z 624.3 (M+H)(+), was identified as an amide-containing porphyrin. It was discovered that the amide compound was an artifact created during the SPE process by reaction of ammonium hydroxide at 1 of 3 potential reaction sites on chlorin-e6-trimethyl ester. Other unique nontargeted chemicals were also detected and the importance of their identification is discussed. Published 2017 Wiley Periodicals Inc. on behalf of SETAC.

To better use toxicity data including biochemical or molecular responses and mechanistic data, we further developed a species sensitivity-weighted distribution (SSWD) method for bisphenol A and 4-nonylphenol. Their aquatic predicted-no-effect concentrations (PNECs) were derived using the log-normal statistical extrapolation method. We calculated aquatic PNECs of bisphenol A and 4-nonylphenol with values of 4.01 and 0.721 mu g/L, respectively. The ecological risk of each chemical in different aquatic environments near Tianjin, China, a coastal municipality along the Bohai Sea, was characterized by hazard quotient and probabilistic risk quotient assessment techniques. Hazard quotients of 7.02 and 5.99 at 2 municipal sewage sites using all of the endpoints were observed for 4-nonylphenol, which indicated high ecological risks posed by 4-nonylphenol to aquatic organisms, especially endocrine-disrupting effects. Moreover, a high ecological risk of 4-nonylphenol was indicated based on the probabilistic risk quotient method. The present results show that combining the SSWD method and the AOP concept could better protect aquatic organisms from adverse effects such as endocrine disruption and could decrease uncertainty in ecological risk assessment.

AB The toxicity effects of zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and cadmium (Cd), both as single metals and in combination, were examined in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Metal effects on lethality were analyzed in a time-dependent manner using different concentrations in K-medium. To investigate the effects on locomotion and chemosensation, lethal concentration at 20% (LC20) values were used. The results showed that Cu toxicity was higher compared with Cd and Zn, resulting in higher mortality rates and a more reduced locomotion. Lethality increased over time for all metals. When Cd was added to Cu, and vice versa, significant increases in toxicity were noted. Different interaction effects were observed for the mixtures ZnCd, ZnCu, CuCd, and ZnCuCd. Zinc seemed to have a neutral toxic effect on Cd, while in combination with Cu, a similar additive effect was seen as for the CuCd combination. Binary and tertiary metal mixtures caused a strong decrease in locomotion, except for the ZnCd combination, where Zn seemed to have a neutral effect. After LC20(24h) exposure, reduced crawling speed (except for Zn) and reduced thrashing behavior (except for Zn and the ZnCd mixture) were observed. Almost no significant effects were observed on chemosensation. Because the same trend of mixture effects was noted in locomotion and in lethality tests, locomotion can probably be considered a sensitive endpoint for metal toxicities. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Mercury (Hg) stable isotope analysis is an emerging technique that has contributed to a better understanding of many aspects of the biogeochemical cycling of Hg in the environment. However, no study has yet evaluated its usefulness in elucidating the sources of methylmercury (MeHg) in songbird species, a common organism for biomonitoring of Hg in forested ecosystems. In the present pilot study, we examined stable mercury isotope ratios in blood of 4 species of songbirds and the invertebrates they are likely foraging on in multiple habitats in a small watershed of mixed forest and wetlands in Acadia National Park in Maine (USA). We found distinct isotopic signatures of MeHg in invertebrates (both mass-dependent fractionation [as delta Hg-202] and mass-independent fractionation [as Delta Hg-199]) among 3 interconnected aquatic habitats. It appears that the Hg isotopic compositions in bird blood cannot be fully accounted for by the isotopic compositions of MeHg in lower trophic levels in each of the habitats examined. Furthermore, the bird blood isotope results cannot be simply explained by an isotopic offset as a result of metabolic fractionation of delta Hg-202 (e.g., internal demethylation). Our results suggest that many of the birds sampled obtain MeHg from sources outside the habitat they were captured in. Our findings also indicate that mass-independent fractionation is a more reliable and conservative tracer than mass-dependent fractionation for identifying sources of MeHg in bird blood. The results demonstrate the feasibility of Hg isotope studies of songbirds but suggest that larger numbers of samples and an expanded geographic area of study may be required for conclusive interpretation.

AB Many bird species are exposed to methylmercury (MeHg) at levels shown to cause sublethal effects. Although MeHg sensitivity and assimilation can vary among species and developmental stages, the underlying reasons (such as MeHg toxicokinetics) are poorly understood. We investigated Hg distribution at the tissue and cellular levels in birds by examining Hg speciation in blood, brain, and liver and Hg subcellular distribution in liver. We used MeHg egg injection of white leghorn chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), sampled at 3 early developmental stages, and embryonic ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) exposed to maternally deposited MeHg. The percentage of MeHg (relative to total Hg [THg]) in blood, brain, and liver ranged from 94 to 121%, indicating little MeHg demethylation. A liver subcellular partitioning procedure was used to determine how THg was distributed between potentially sensitive and detoxified compartments. The distributions of THg among subcellular fractions were similar among chicken time points, and between embryonic chicken and ring-billed gulls. A greater proportion of THg was associated with metal-sensitive fractions than detoxified fractions. Within the sensitive compartment, THg was found predominately in heat-denatured proteins (approximate to 42-46%), followed by mitochondria (approximate to 15-18%). A low rate of MeHg demethylation and high proportion of THg in metal-sensitive subcellular fractions further indicates that embryonic and hatchling time points are Hg-sensitive developmental stages, although further work is needed across a range of additional species and life stages.

AB Small ponds exist across a permanence gradient, and pond permanence is hypothesized to be a primary determinant of insect community structure and insect-mediated methylmercury (MeHg) flux from ponds to the surrounding terrestrial landscape. The present study describes the first experiment examining the recovery of insect-mediated MeHg flux following a drying disturbance that converted permanent ponds with insectivorous fish to semipermanent ponds without fish. Floating emergence traps were used to collect emergent insects for 10 wk in the spring and summer from 5 ponds with fish (permanent) and 5 ponds that were drained to remove fish, dried, and refilled with water (semipermanent). During the 73-d period after semipermanent ponds were refilled, total MeHg flux from semipermanent ponds was not significantly different than total MeHg flux from permanent ponds, indicating that insect-mediated MeHg flux had rapidly recovered in semipermanent ponds following the drying disturbance. Methylmercury fluxes from dragonflies (Odonata: Anisoptera) and phantom midges (Diptera: Chaoboridae) were significantly greater from newly refilled semipermanent ponds than permanent ponds, but the MeHg fluxes from the other 8 emergent insect taxa did not differ between treatments. The present study demonstrates the impact of drying disturbance and the effect of community structure on the cross-system transport of contaminants from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems.

AB To explore the cause of species-specific differences and structure-activity relationships in the debromination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in fish, a series of in vitro measurements of hepatic metabolism of PBDE were made using crucian carp (Carassius carassius) and catfish (Silurus asotus) and the activity of deiodinase in liver microsomes was measured. Debromination was observed in the crucian carp but not in the catfish. No difference was found in total deiodinase activity despite the activity of type 1 deiodinase in crucian carp being twice that of catfish. It is difficult to determine whether the differences in deiodinase activity were responsible for the species-specific differences observed. In crucian carp, penta-brominated diphenyl ether congeners exhibited the highest debromination rates, and the transformation rate decreased with an increasing number of substituted bromines. Adjacent bromine substitution in the phenyl ring was a necessary, but insufficient, condition for debromination in crucian carp. Doubly flanked bromine was always preferentially removed, while single-flanked bromine, meta-substituted bromine, was debrominated the most, followed by para- and then ortho-bromine. No debromination was observed for single-flanked bromine when there was a symmetrical structure with (2, 4, 6) bromine substitutions in 1 phenyl ring, indicating that this structure can improve resistance to debromination metabolism.

AB High concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in streams can be a significant stressor to aquatic organisms. To understand the likely sources and toxicity of PAHs in Milwaukee-area streams, streambed sediment samples from 40 sites and parking lot dust samples from 6 sites were analyzed for 38 parent PAHs and 25 alkylated PAHs. Diagnostic ratios, profile correlations, principal components analysis, source-receptor modeling, and mass fractions analysis were used to identify potential PAH sources to streambed sediment samples, and land-use analysis was used to relate streambed sediment PAH concentrations to different urban-related land uses. On the basis of this multiple lines-of-evidence approach, coal-tar pavement sealant was indicated as the primary source of PAHs in a majority of streambed sediment samples, contributing an estimated 77% of total PAHs to samples, on average. Comparison with the probable effect concentrations and (or) the equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmark indicates that 78% of stream sediment samples are likely to cause adverse effects to benthic organisms.

AB Nanosilver (nAg) is a nanoparticle commonly incorporated into consumer products for its antimicrobial properties that has been detected in aquatic environments. Toxic effects of nAg on fish have been observed, and nAg may induce a stress response in fish in the form of increased blood plasma cortisol. Effects of nAg exposure on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were investigated over a 28-d period using blood plasma cortisol concentrations as an indicator of stress. Several morphometric measures (growth, Fulton's condition factor, and hepatosomatic index [HSI]) were also taken during the experiment to investigate potential whole-body effects of exposure, and concentrations of nAg in fish muscle tissue were measured. Fish were exposed to environmentally relevant (average 0.28 mu g/L) and higher (average 47.60 mu g/L) exposure concentrations of nAg. The results showed a significant increase in blood plasma cortisol for both exposure treatments. A significant effect on HSI by treatment dependent on exposure time was also observed, although no obvious trend was detected, whereas other morphometric measures were not affected by nAg exposure. In addition, Ag was detected in fish muscle tissue. The results indicate that although nAg did engage the stress response in fish, it did not affect growth or condition under the experimental conditions and time frame investigated. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Two laboratory performance studies with 21 and 11 participants were carried out for passive sampling of nonpolar chemicals in water, using silicone samplers that were deployed for 7 wk and 13 wk at 2 river sites in the Netherlands. Target analytes were polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexachlorobutadiene, hexachlorobenzene, and a number of performance reference compounds (PRCs). Calculation of aqueous concentrations based on prescribed input values and a prescribed uptake model was also included. Between-laboratory coefficients of variation (CVs) in the analysis of target compounds were approximately 20% at concentrations of 100 ng g(-1) and approximately 100% at concentrations of 0.01 ng g(-1), which was similar to previous results for the analysis of biota samples. The analysis of PRCs yielded water sampling rates with a between-laboratory CV of 18% to 30%. The sampling rate model showed a nearly perfect match with the consensus values of retained PRCs. The implications of the present study for future interlaboratory exercises are discussed. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The objective of the present study was to review the current knowledge regarding the bioaccumulation potential of ionizable organic compounds (IOCs), with a focus on the availability of empirical data for fish. Aspects of the bioaccumulation potential of IOCs in fish that can be characterized relatively well include the pH dependence of gill uptake and elimination, uptake in the gut, and sorption to phospholipids (membrane-water partitioning). Key challenges include the lack of empirical data for biotransformation and binding in plasma. Fish possess a diverse array of proteins that may transport IOCs across cell membranes. Except in a few cases, however, the significance of this transport for uptake and accumulation of environmental contaminants is unknown. Two case studies are presented. The first describes modeled effects of pH and biotransformation on the bioconcentration of organic acids and bases, while the second employs an updated model to investigate factors responsible for accumulation of perfluorinated alkyl acids. The perfluorinated alkyl acid case study is notable insofar as it illustrates the likely importance of membrane transporters in the kidney and highlights the potential value of read-across approaches. Recognizing the current need to perform bioaccumulation hazard assessments and ecological and exposure risk assessment for IOCs, the authors provide a tiered strategy that progresses (as needed) from conservative assumptions (models and associated data) to more sophisticated models requiring chemical-specific information.

AB One of the principal metabolites in cattle excreta following the administration of Synovex((R)) ONE, which contains estradiol benzoate and trenbolone acetate, is 17 alpha-estradiol. As part of the environmental assessment of the use of Synovex ONE, data were generated to characterize the fate of 17 alpha-estradiol in the environment. Studies were conducted to determine the degradation and transformation of 17 alpha-[C-14]-estradiol in 2 representative water-sediment systems each under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The same transformation products-estriol, 17 beta-estradiol, and estrone-were formed, principally in the sediment phase, under both conditions in both systems. From the production of these transformation products, the 50% disappearance time (DT50) values of estrone and 17 beta-estradiol were determined, along with the DT50 values of 17 alpha-estradiol and the total drug (17 alpha-estradiol+17 beta-estradiol+estrone). The results indicate that 17 alpha-[C-14]-estradiol was more persistent under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions and that 17 alpha-[C-14]-estradiol was less persistent than its transformation products. The DT50 values for the total system (aqueous and sediment phases) and for the total residues (17 alpha- estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, and estrone) were selected for use in modeling the environmental fate of estradiol benzoate. For aerobic degradation in the water-sediment system, the DT50 was 31.1 d, and it was 107.8 d for the anaerobic system. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Effects of mercury (Hg) on birds have been studied extensively and with increasing frequency in recent years. The authors conducted a comprehensive review of methylmercury (MeHg) effects on bird reproduction, evaluating laboratory and field studies in which observed effects could be attributed primarily to Hg. The review focuses on exposures via diet and maternal transfer in which observed effects (or lack thereof) were reported relative to Hg concentrations in diet, eggs, or adult blood. Applicable data were identified for 23 species. From this data set, the authors identified ranges of toxicity reference values suitable for risk-assessment applications. Typical ranges of Hg effect thresholds are approximately 0.2mg/kg to >1.4mg/kg in diet, 0.05mg/kg/d to 0.5mg/kg/d on a dose basis, 0.6mg/kg to 2.7mg/kg in eggs, and 2.1mg/kg to >6.7mg/kg in parental blood (all concentrations on a wet wt basis). For Hg in avian blood, the review represents the first broad compilation of relevant toxicity data. For dietary exposures, the current data support TRVs that are greater than older, commonly used TRVs. The older diet-based TRVs incorporate conservative assumptions and uncertainty factors that are no longer justified, although they generally were appropriate when originally derived, because of past data limitations. The egg-based TRVs identified from the review are more similar to other previously derived TRVs but have been updated to incorporate new information from recent studies. While important research needs remain, a key recommendation is that species not yet tested for MeHg toxicity should be evaluated using toxicity data from tested species with similar body weights.

AB The production and use of brominated flame retardants have been increasingly restricted. Organophosphate esters (OPEs) have been widely used as substitutes for brominated flame retardants. However, little is yet known about human exposure to OPEs. The potential health risks posed by OPEs were assessed by determining the concentrations of 6 OPEs in pooled serum samples from residents of Shandong, China. The mean Sigma 6OPE concentrations in 2011 and 2015 were 680ng/g lipid and 709ng/g lipid, respectively. The most abundant OPE was tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, contributing a mean of 82% of the Sigma 6OPE concentration. A significant correlation was found between the tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate and tri-n-butylphosphate concentrations, possibly indicating that these OPEs are used in similar applications and have similar human exposure pathways in the study area. The mean tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate concentration increased from 536ng/g lipid in 2011 to 605ng/g lipid in 2015, but the concentrations of tri-n-butylphosphate, triphenyl phosphate, and tris(methylphenyl) esters decreased between 2011 and 2015. This could indicate that chlorinated OPEs bioaccumulate in humans more strongly than nonchlorinated OPEs do. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:414-421. (c) 2016 SETAC

Initial studies have shown that MON 0818 is more toxic to aquatic animals than the active ingredient. However, few studies have examined the effect of exposure to MON 0818 on species of mollusks, and no studies have examined the effect on gastropods. The present study investigated the effect of acute exposure (96h) of MON 0818 to the eggs, juveniles, and adults of the file ramshorn snail (Planorbella pilsbryi). Concentrations of MON 0818 up to 9.9mg/L did not have a significant effect on the viability of eggs (p>0.05). Juvenile snails (50% lethal concentration [LC50]=4.0mg/L) were more sensitive than adult snails (LC50=4.9-9.1mg/L). Oviposition was inhibited by exposure to MON 0818 (median effective concentration [EC50]=0.4-2.0mg/L). However, oviposition resumed when snails were removed to clean water, even after 96-h exposure to up to 4.9mg/L of MON 0818. Exposure to a concentration 2.7mg/L caused visible damage to the tentacles of adult snails, which could potentially impact chemoreception. A deterministic hazard assessment indicated that environmentally relevant concentrations of MON 0818 could pose a hazard to the deposition of eggs. However, because of the relatively short half-life of MON 0818 in aquatic systems and the ability of snails to resume oviposition following the dissipation of MON 0818, environmentally relevant concentrations of MON 0818 likely pose a de minimis risk to populations of ramshorn snails.

AB Although population models are recognized as necessary tools in the ecological risk assessment of pesticides, particularly for species listed under the Endangered Species Act, their application in this context is currently limited to very few cases. The authors developed a detailed, individual-based population model for a threatened plant species, the decurrent false aster (Boltonia decurrens), for application in pesticide risk assessment. Floods and competition with other plant species are known factors that drive the species' population dynamics and were included in the model approach. The authors use the model to compare the population-level effects of 5 toxicity surrogates applied to B. decurrens under varying environmental conditions. The model results suggest that the environmental conditions under which herbicide applications occur may have a higher impact on populations than organism-level sensitivities to an herbicide within a realistic range. Indirect effects may be as important as the direct effects of herbicide applications by shifting competition strength if competing species have different sensitivities to the herbicide. The model approach provides a case study for population-level risk assessments of listed species. Population-level effects of herbicides can be assessed in a realistic and species-specific context, and uncertainties can be addressed explicitly. The authors discuss how their approach can inform the future development and application of modeling for population-level risk assessments of listed species, and ecological risk assessment in general.

AB Roskilde University (Denmark) hosted a November 2015 workshop, Environmental RiskAssessing and Managing Multiple Risks in a Changing World. This Focus article presents the consensus recommendations of 30 attendees from 9 countries regarding implementation of a common currency (ecosystem services) for holistic environmental risk assessment and management; improvements to risk assessment and management in a complex, human-modified, and changing world; appropriate development of protection goals in a 2-stage process; dealing with societal issues; risk-management information needs; conducting risk assessment of risk management; and development of adaptive and flexible regulatory systems. The authors encourage both cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to address their 10 recommendations: 1) adopt ecosystem services as a common currency for risk assessment and management; 2) consider cumulative stressors (chemical and nonchemical) and determine which dominate to best manage and restore ecosystem services; 3) fully integrate risk managers and communities of interest into the risk-assessment process; 4) fully integrate risk assessors and communities of interest into the risk-management process; 5) consider socioeconomics and increased transparency in both risk assessment and risk management; 6) recognize the ethical rights of humans and ecosystems to an adequate level of protection; 7) determine relevant reference conditions and the proper ecological context for assessments in human-modified systems; 8) assess risks and benefits to humans and the ecosystem and consider unintended consequences of management actions; 9) avoid excessive conservatism or possible underprotection resulting from sole reliance on binary, numerical benchmarks; and 10) develop adaptive risk-management and regulatory goals based on ranges of uncertainty.

AB Dioxin exposure during bird embryonic development disrupts immunity as well as mechanisms involved in energy metabolism, potentially affecting negatively acute-phase responses to pathogens. Thus, we hypothesized that embryonic exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) changes the metabolism and blood physiology of domestic chicks, affecting their physiological competence for responding to immune challenges. To test this hypothesis, we injected doses of 0, 1.5, and 3 ng TCDD/egg (based on survival experiments) on embryonic day 4 and then measured O(2)consumption and CO(2)production for metabolic rate, ventilation, and body temperature (T-B) in 5-d-old chicks. Then, chicks were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) or saline prior to repeating the physiological measurements. A second chick group exposed to identical TCDD and LPS treatments had blood partial pressure of oxygen, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, pH, bicarbonate concentration, lactate concentration, osmolality, hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell concentration, and hematocrit, as well as T-B, analyzed at 1 and 5 h after LPS injection. Metabolism in chicks embryonically exposed to 1.5 and 3 ng TCDD/egg was up to 37% higher, whereas body mass of chicks exposed to 3 ng TCDD/egg was approximately 6% lower. Chicks embryonically exposed to 3 ng TCDD/egg challenged with LPS showed a relative persistent hypometabolism accompanied by elimination of the normal hematological and osmotic responses to LPS. We conclude that embryonic exposure to TCDD affects posthatching metabolism as well as impairs metabolic, hematological, and osmotic responses to LPS.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-13. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB The Lake Huron ecosystem is unique among the Laurentian Great Lakes (USA/Canada) in that its surface area encompasses 3 distinct basins. This ecosystem recently experienced significant ecological restructuring characterized by changes in primary production, species dominance and abundances, and top predator energy dynamics. However, much of the evidence for this restructuring has been largely derived from biomonitoring data obtained from long-term sampling of the lake's Main Basin. We examined polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations and the stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) in rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), bloater (Coregonus hoyi), and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) to determine spatial variability in these environmental markers as indicators of the ubiquity of trophic restructuring throughout Lake Huron. Stable isotopes indicated that North Channel fish occupied trophic positions between 0.5 and 1.0 lower relative to Main Basin and Georgian Bay conspecifics, respectively. Sum PCB concentrations for 41 congeners were highest for fish from the Main Basin (27.5 +/- 3.0 ng g(-1)wet wt) and Georgian Bay (26.3 +/- 3.4 ng g(-1)wet wt) relative to North Channel (13.6 +/- 1.2 ng g(-1)wet wt) fish. Discriminant functions analysis demonstrated basin-specific PCB congener profiles with individual species also having distinct profiles dependent on their basin of collection. These bioaccumulation patterns among Lake Huron forage fish mirror those reported for lake trout in this lake and indicate that the degree of food-web ecological restructuring in Lake Huron is not equivalent across the basins. Specifically, basin-specific PCB congener profiles demonstrated that differences among Lake Huron secondary and top predator consumer species are likely dictated by cross-basin differences in zooplankton community ecology and trophodynamics that can regulate the efficiencies of prey energy transfer and PCB congener bioaccumulation patterns in aquatic food webs.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;39:1712-1723.

AB The positive matrix factorization (PMF) receptor model was used for the first time to quantify the source contributions to heavy metal pollution of sediment on a national basin scale in the upstream, midstream, and downstream rivers (Teesta and Kortoya-Shitalakkah and Meghna-Rupsha and Pasur) of Bangladesh. The metal contamination status, co-occurrence, and ecotoxicological risk were also investigated. Sediment samples were collected from 30 sites at a depth range of 0 to 20 cm for analysis of 9 metals using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The mean concentrations of metals varied for upstream, lower midstream, and downstream river segments. The results showed that chromium (Cr) exhibited a strong significant co-occurrence network with other metals (e.g., manganese [Mn], iron [Fe], and nickel [Ni]). Monte Carlo simulation results of the geo-accumulation index (Igeo; 63.3%) and risk indices (48.5%) showed that cadmium (Cd) was the main contributor to sediment pollution. However, the cumulative probabilities of sediments being polluted by metals were ranked as "moderate to heavily polluted" (Igeo 46.6%; risk index 16.7%). Toxicity unit results revealed that zinc (Zn) and Cd were the key toxic contributors to sediments. The PMF model predicted metal concentrations and identified 4 potential sources. The agricultural source (factor 1) mostly contributed to copper (Cu; 78.9%) and arsenic (As; 62.8%); Ni (96.9%) and Mn (83.5%) exhibited industrial point sources (factor 2), with 2 hot spots in northwestern and southwestern regions. Cadmium (93.5%) had anthropogenic point sources (factor 3), and Fe (64.3%) and Cr (53.5%) had a mixed source (factor 4). Spatially, similar patterns between PMF apportioning factors and predicted metal sources were identified, showing the efficiency of the model for river systems analysis. The degree of metal contamination in the river segments suggests an alarming condition for biotic components of the ecosystem.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-14. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB As contaminant exposures in aquatic ecosystems continue to increase, the need for streamlining research efforts in environmental toxicology using predictive frameworks also grows. One such framework is the adverse outcome pathway (AOP). An AOP framework organizes and utilizes toxicological information to connect measurable molecular endpoints to an adverse outcome of regulatory relevance via a series of events at different levels of biological organization. Molecular endpoints or biomarkers are essential to develop AOPs and are valuable early warning signs of the toxicity of pollutants, including contaminants of emerging concern. Ecological risk-assessment approaches using tools such as biomarkers and AOPs benefit from identification of molecular targets conserved across species. Bivalve models are useful in such approaches and integral to our understanding of ecological and human health risks associated with contaminant exposures. We discuss the value of using biomarker approaches in bivalve models to meet the demands of twenty-first-century toxicology.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-13. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Herbicides have been shown to reduce flower production and to delay flowering, with results varying among herbicides and tested plant species. We investigated the effects of herbicides on flowering in an extensive greenhouse study conducted in Canada and Denmark. The effects of low doses of 5 different herbicides (bromoxynil, ioxynil + bromoxynil, metsulfuron-methyl, clopyralid, and glyphosate), simulating realistic drift scenarios (1 and 5% recommended field rates), on plant flowering were examined using 9 wild plant species exposed at either the seedling (6- to 8-leaf) or flower bud stage. Following herbicide exposure, initial flowering date as well as flower production over time were recorded over the growing period. The effect of herbicides on cumulative flower numbers and flowering time were modeled using Gompertz growth models. Significant delays to peak flowering and/or reductions in flower production were observed in at least one plant species for all tested herbicides, with glyphosate often exhibiting the greatest negative effects, that is, plant death. Except for ioxynil + bromoxynil, there was no clear evidence of either the seedling or the flower bud stage being more sensitive. Overall, 58% of all species x life stage x herbicide treatments resulted in either a statistically significant or a strong decline in flower production with herbicide application rates up to 5% of recommended field rates, whereas significant or strong delays in peak flowering were also detected but were slightly less common. Effects at 1% label rates were minimal. Simultaneous delays to peak flowering and reductions in total flower production occurred in approximately 25% of all cases, indicating that herbicide application rates simulating realistic drift scenarios would likely have negative effects on wild floral communities.

AB The present study pertains to a polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) laboratory calibration to estimate the sampling rates for 44 pharmaceuticals featuring a wide range of polarity (-0.6 < octanol/water partition coefficient [log K-OW] < 5.4). The calibration was performed at 16.0 +/- 1.5 degrees C for 4 water flow velocities (0, 2-3, 6-7, and 20 cm/s) in both a tank (for calibration at 0 cm/s) and a laboratory-scale artificial river filled with 200 and 500 L of tap water spiked with 0.3 mu g/L of each compound, respectively. Twelve new sampling rates and 26 sampling rates already available in the literature were determined, whereas the sampling rates for 6 pharmaceuticals could not be determined due to nonlinearity or poor accumulation in POCIS. An increase in the sampling rate value with flow velocity was observed, which is consistent with a decrease in the effective thickness of the water boundary layer at the POCIS membrane surface.

AB Per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are pervasive in aquatic systems globally and capable of causing detrimental effects on human and wildlife health. However, most studies are conducted under artificial conditions that are not representative of environmental exposures. Environmental exposures are characterized by multiple routes of exposure, low aquatic PFAS levels, and greater environmental variability than laboratory tests. Determining whether these factors influence toxicity is critical for understanding the effects of PFAS on aquatic life, including amphibians. Our goal was to assess the impact of PFAS on an amphibian under semirealistic conditions. We reared northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) larvae in outdoor mesocosms containing sediment spiked to low, medium, and high levels (nominally 10, 100, or 1000 ppb dry wt) of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) or perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) for 30 d. Larvae in all PFOS treatments and the medium-PFOA treatment were approximately 1.5 Gosner stages less developed than control animals after 30 d. Notably, these developmental delays were observed at PFOS concentrations in the water as low as 0.06 ppb, which is considerably lower than levels associated with developmental effects in laboratory studies. Our results suggest that deriving toxicity values from laboratory studies examining aquatic exposure only may underestimate the effects of environmental PFAS exposure.

AB Recently, there has been renewed interest in the development and use of empirical models to predict metal bioavailability and derive protective values for aquatic life. However, there is considerable variability in the conceptual and statistical approaches with which these models have been developed. In the present study, we review case studies of empirical bioavailability model development, evaluating and making recommendations on key issues, including species selection, identifying toxicity-modifying factors (TMFs) and the appropriate environmental range of these factors, use of existing toxicity data sets and experimental design for developing new data sets, statistical considerations in deriving species-specific and pooled bioavailability models, and normalization of species sensitivity distributions using these models. We recommend that TMFs be identified from a combination of available chemical speciation and toxicity data and statistical evaluations of their relationships to toxicity. Experimental designs for new toxicity data must be sufficiently robust to detect nonlinear responses to TMFs and should encompass a large fraction (e.g., 90%) of the TMF range. Model development should involve a rigorous use of both visual plotting and statistical techniques to evaluate data fit. When data allow, we recommend using a simple linear model structure and developing pooled models rather than retaining multiple taxa-specific models. We conclude that empirical bioavailability models often have similar predictive capabilities compared to mechanistic models and can provide a relatively simple, transparent tool for predicting the effects of TMFs on metal bioavailability to achieve desired environmental management goals.

AB In the Southern High Plains of the United States, beef cattle feed yards and row crop agriculture are predominant sources of agrochemical usage. Beef cattle feed yards use large quantities of veterinary pharmaceuticals to promote cattle growth and health, along with insecticides to control insect pests, whereas row crop-based agriculture relies on herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides to increase yields. Previous studies have documented the occurrence of agrochemicals beyond feed yard and row crop agriculture boundaries in uncultivated, marginal areas, raising concern that migratory pollinators and pollinators indigenous to the Southern High Plains frequenting these remaining habitat corridors may become exposed to toxic agrochemicals. Larvae of the painted lady butterfly (Vanessa cardui) were used to investigate the potential toxicity of agrochemicals used on feed yards and in row crop agriculture among pollinators. Moxidectin, an antiparasiticide used on beef cattle feed yards, was determined to be extremely toxic to V. cardui larvae, with a lethal dose at which 50% of larvae died of 2.1 +/- 0.1 ng/g. Pyraclostrobin, clothianidin, and permethrin all delayed V. cardui development. However, moxidectin was the only chemical that produced significant toxic effects at environmentally relevant concentrations. These results indicate that agrochemicals originating from feed yards have the potential to adversely impact the development of pollinator larvae occurring in the Southern High Plains.

AB The evaluation of adverse effects of pesticides, pesticide adjuvants, and their combination on honeybees is hampered by a lack of colony-level bioassays reflecting productivity and survival over longer term exposure. In the present study, the joint toxicity of acetamiprid and co-applied pesticide adjuvants (N-methyl pyrrolidone [NMP], Silwet L-77, and Triton X-100) to honeybees was determined both in the laboratory and under semifield conditions. The 3 pesticide adjuvants caused no significant acute toxicity to honeybees by themselves; however, in the laboratory tests, they significantly increased the acute contact toxicity of acetamiprid to honeybees. For the semifield tests, in the T2 group (treatment with 5% acetamiprid soluble concentrate [SL] containing 10% Silwet L-77), the mortality of honeybees was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the blank control on the fourth day after application (DAA + 4), that of the T1 group (5% acetamiprid SL containing 10% NMP) on DAA + 4 and DAA + 7 (seventh day after application), and that of the T3 group (5% acetamiprid SL containing 10% Triton X-100) on DAA + 4. Furthermore, the flight intensity in the T2 group on DAA + 7, the colony intensity on DAA + 28 (28th day after application), and the mean areas covered by pupae on DAA + 15 (15th day after application) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of the blank control. Therefore, pesticide adjuvants may be important factors in increasing the toxicity of neonicotinoids to honeybees. Measures should be taken to manage the environmental risk of pesticide adjuvants during the process of formulation development and registration. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-7. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB The present study reviewed the impacts of wastewater on macroinvertebrates over 4 decades in a United Kingdom lowland river. This involved examining changes in chemicals, temperature, flow, and macroinvertebrate diversity from the 1970s until 2017 for a wastewater-dominated river downstream of Swindon in the United Kingdom (population ~ 220 000). When the wastewater treatment process changed from trickling filter to activated sludge in 1991, biological oxygen demand was nearly halved (90th percentile from 8.1 to 4.6 mg/L), ammonia peaks dropped more than 7-fold (90th percentile from 3.9 to 0.53 mg/L), whereas dissolved oxygen climbed consistently above 60% saturation (10th percentile from 49 to 64%) at a sampling point 2 km downstream of the wastewater treatment plant. A sustained increase in the number of macroinvertebrate species was evident from that point. River flow did not change, temperature rose slightly, and the major metal concentrations declined steadily over most of the monitoring period. Neither the introduction of phosphate stripping in 1999 nor the use of tertiary granular activated charcoal from 2008 to 2014 had strong positive effects on subsequent macroinvertebrate diversity. That the diversity still had not reached the ideal status by 2016 may be related to the modest habitat quality, agricultural pesticides, and limited recolonization potential in the catchment. The results indicate that urban wastewaters, with their chemical pollutants, are today probably not the biggest threat to the macroinvertebrate diversity of multiply stressed lowland rivers in the United Kingdom.

AB The relationship between agricultural practices and the welfare of wild birds has gained increased attention over the last decades. To assess the potential effects of chlorpyrifos on the bird community, a multiyear, multisite monitoring program was carried out in treated cider orchards (in the United Kingdom) and treated citrus orchards (in Spain). Constant-effort mist netting was used over several consecutive years in the United Kingdom (2012-2014) and Spain (2010-2012). The general structure of the bird community and the presence of breeding species were analyzed. Twelve and 11 bird species (out of 81 and 45 trapped) in Spain and the United Kingdom, respectively, exceeded the 2% dominance value. For a selection of 6 species in citrus and 4 in cider orchards, N-mixture models were fitted to the number of trapped birds. The abundance of most species was strongly and significantly affected by seasonality. No species showed any indication of reduction in population size over the years. The results of this extensive field program support the indications that chlorpyrifos spray applications present a low risk to the bird community over the years. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:616-629.

AB The experimental determination of bioaccumulation is challenging, and a number of approaches have been developed for its prediction. It is important to assess the applicability of these predictive approaches to nanomaterials (NMs), which have been shown to bioaccumulate. The octanol/water partition coefficient (K-OW) may not be applicable to some NMs that are not found in either the octanol or water phases but rather are found at the interface. Thus the K-OW values obtained for certain NMs are shown not to correlate well with the experimentally determined bioaccumulation. Implementation of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for NMs is also challenging because the bioaccumulation of NMs depends on nano-specific properties such as shape, size, and surface area. Thus there is a need to develop new QSAR models based on these new nanodescriptors; current efforts appear to focus on digital processing of NM images as well as the conversion of surface chemistry parameters into adsorption indices. Water solubility can be used as a screening tool for the exclusion of NMs with short half-lives. Adaptation of fugacity/aquivalence models, which include physicochemical properties, may give some insights into the bioaccumulation potential of NMs, especially with the addition of a biota component. The use of kinetic models, including physiologically based pharmacokinetic models, appears to be the most suitable approach for predicting bioaccumulation of NMs. Furthermore, because bioaccumulation of NMs depends on a number of biotic and abiotic factors, it is important to take these factors into account when one is modeling bioaccumulation and interpreting bioaccumulation results.

AB Water resources in many arid to semi-arid regions are stressed by population growth and drought. Growing populations and climatic changes are influencing contaminant and water chemistry dynamics in urban inland waters, where flows can be dominated by, or even dependent on, wastewater effluent discharge. In these watersheds, interacting stressors such as dissolved oxygen and environmental contaminants (e.g., pharmaceuticals) have the potential to affect fish physiology and populations. Recent field observations from our group identified the calcium channel blocker (CCB) diltiazem in fish plasma exceeding human therapeutic doses (e.g., C-min) in aquatic systems impaired because of nonattainment of dissolved oxygen water quality standards. Therefore our study objectives examined: 1) standard acute and chronic effects of dissolved oxygen and diltiazem to fish, 2) influences of dissolved oxygen at criteria levels deemed protective of aquatic life on diltiazem toxicity to fish, and 3) whether sublethal effects occur at diltiazem water concentrations predicted to cause a human therapeutic level (therapeutic hazard value [THV]) in fish plasma. Dissolved oxygenxdiltiazem co-exposures significantly decreased survival at typical stream, lake, and reservoir water quality standards of 5.0 and 3.0mg dissolved oxygen/L. Dissolved oxygen and diltiazem growth effects were observed at 2 times and 10 times lower than median lethal concentration (LC50) values (1.7 and 28.2mg/L, respectively). Larval fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) swimming behavior following low dissolved oxygen and diltiazem exposure generally decreased and was significantly reduced in light-to-dark bursting distance traveled, number of movements, and duration at concentrations as low as the THV. Individual and population level consequences of such responses are not yet understood, particularly in older organisms or other species; however, these findings suggest that assessments with pharmaceuticals and other cardioactive contaminants may underestimate adverse outcomes in fish across dissolved oxygen levels considered protective of aquatic life.

AB Engineered nanoparticles (NPs) entering the environment are subject to various transformations that in turn influence how particles are presented to, and taken up by, organisms. To understand the effect of soil properties on the toxicity of nanosilver to Caenorhabditis elegans, toxicity assays were performed in porewater extracts from natural soils with varying organic matter content and pH using 3-8nm unfunctionalized silver (Ag 3-8Unf), 52-nm polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated Ag NPs (Ag 52PVP), and AgNO3 as ionic Ag. Effects on NP agglomeration and stability were investigated using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4); Ag+ showed greater overall toxicity than nanosilver, with little difference between the NP types. Increasing soil organic matter content significantly decreased the toxicity of Ag 3-8Unf, whereas it increased that of AgNO3. The toxicity of all Ag treatments significantly decreased with increasing porewater pH. Dissolution of both NPs in the porewater extracts was too low to have contributed to their observed toxic effects. The UV-vis spectroscopy revealed low levels of agglomeration/aggregation independent of soil properties for Ag 3-8Unf, whereas higher organic matter as well as low pH appeared to stabilize Ag 52PVP. Overall, both soil organic matter content and pH affected NP fate as well as toxicity to C. elegans; however, there appears to be no clear connection between the measured particle characteristics and their effect.

AB We investigated polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination at the Ashtabula River (northeast OH, USA) area of concern following remedial dredging using araneid and tetragnathid spiders. The PCB concentrations remain elevated in the area of concern compared with reference conditions. Patterns of contamination were strikingly similar between taxa, but were higher in tetragnathids at the most contaminated sites. Spider PCB homolog distributions identified 2 PCB sources to the area of concern. Based on these findings, we recommend situations where these taxa can be used alone, in concert, or combined into a composite spider sample to assess environmental contamination.

AB The fish acute toxicity test method is foundational to aquatic toxicity testing strategies, yet the literature lacks a concise sample size assessment. Although various sources address sample size, historical precedent seems to play a larger role than objective measures. We present a novel and comprehensive quantification of the effect of sample size on estimation of the median lethal concentration (LC50), covering a wide range of scenarios. The results put into perspective the practical differences across a range of sample sizes, from n=5/concentration up to n=23/concentration. We also provide a framework for setting sample size guidance illustrating ways to quantify the performance of LC50 estimation, which can be used to set sample size guidance given reasonably difficult (or worst-case) scenarios. There is a clear benefit to larger sample size studies: they reduce error in the determination of LC50s, and lead to more robust safe environmental concentration determinations, particularly in cases likely to be called worst-case (shallow slope and true LC50 near the edges of the concentration range). Given that the use of well-justified sample sizes is crucial to reducing uncertainty in toxicity estimates, these results lead us to recommend a reconsideration of the current de minimis 7/concentration sample size for critical studies (e.g., studies needed for a chemical registration, which are being tested for the first time, or involving difficult test substances).

AB Bird eggs are often used to monitor levels and trends of mercury (Hg) in the environment. Logistical issues in such studies sometimes require the use of eggs at different stages of development. Therefore, it is important to understand how embryonic age may affect egg Hg concentrations. Studies using dry weight Hg concentrations in eggs assume that dry mass (e.g., lipids) does not change through embryonic development and thus expressing concentrations on a dry weight basis adjusts for any changes that may occur in egg mass throughout development. That assumption is tested in the present study by injecting chicken eggs with Hg and measuring Hg concentrations in embryonic contents at different stages of artificial incubation. The results indicate that dry weight Hg concentrations in eggs at later stages of development are statistically greater than in undeveloped eggs. To address this issue, we developed a method of standardizing egg Hg concentrations for embryonic age based on egg contents density (egg contents mass/egg contents volume). A combined dataset (n = 225) from precocial and semi-precocial birds was used to demonstrate that egg contents density declines with increasing embryonic development. Based on this finding, we applied a formula to adjust egg dry weight Hg concentrations for stage of development: adjusted egg [Hg] = unadjusted [Hg] x (egg contents density). The application of this approach to adjust data from the chicken egg Hg injection study resulted in there being no statistically significant difference in dry weight Hg levels in eggs at different stages of embryonic development. The adjustment approach described in the present study is a straightforward method to account for stage of development when assessing Hg levels in avian eggs and should be widely applicable to studies of this nature.

AB The early life stages of freshwater mussels are particularly sensitive to copper (Cu) contamination. We measured the acute toxicity, bioaccumulation, and sublethal effects of Cu in glochidia. In addition, we used radiolabeled Cu (Cu-64) to examine the time-dependent kinetics of uptake over 24 h. Uptake of Cu-64 by live and dead glochidia exposed to 0.11 mmol/L exhibited similar hyperbolic patterns over the first 40 min, indicating an adsorptive phase independent of larval metabolism. Thereafter, uptake was linear with time, with a 10-fold lower bioaccumulation rate in live than in dead animals, representing a close to steady state of Cu regulation. In contrast, dead glochidia exhibited a progressively increasing uptake, possibly attributable to the fact that metal-binding sites become more accessible. Mortality was strongly correlated with bioaccumulation (48 h); live glochidia exposed to Cu concentrations >0.27 mu mol/L lost their regulatory ability and accumulated Cu to an even greater extent than dead animals. Exposure to Cu induced significant decreases in whole-body Na+ and Mg2+ concentrations; increases in reactive oxygen species concentration, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation; and a decrease in antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals. Overall, these results clarify the patterns of Cu uptake and regulation, emphasize the importance of distinguishing between live and dead larvae, and indicate that toxicity is associated with Cu bioaccumulation, involving both ionoregulatory disturbance and oxidative stress.

AB Urban regions of the world are expanding rapidly, placing additional stress on water resources. Urban water bodies serve many purposes, from washing and sources of drinking water to transport and conduits for storm drainage and effluent discharge. These water bodies receive chemical emissions arising from either single or multiple point sources, diffuse sources which can be continuous, intermittent, or seasonal. Thus, aquatic organisms in these water bodies are exposed to temporally and compositionally variable mixtures. We have delineated source-specific signatures of these mixtures for diffuse urban runoff and urban point source exposure scenarios to support risk assessment and management of these mixtures. The first step in a tiered approach to assessing chemical exposure has been developed based on the event mean concentration concept, with chemical concentrations in runoff defined by volumes of water leaving each surface and the chemical exposure mixture profiles for different urban scenarios. Although generalizations can be made about the chemical composition of urban sources and event mean exposure predictions for initial prioritization, such modeling needs to be complemented with biological monitoring data. It is highly unlikely that the current paradigm of routine regulatory chemical monitoring alone will provide a realistic appraisal of urban aquatic chemical mixture exposures. Future consideration is also needed of the role of nonchemical stressors in such highly modified urban water bodies. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:703-714. (c) 2017 The Authors.

AB Models used to assess leaching risks generally use organic carbon partition coefficient (k(OC)) values derived from batch experiments on topsoil samples to estimate pesticide sorption in subsoils of much smaller organic carbon contents. This can introduce significant errors in leaching risk calculations, because inorganic sorbents can play an important role for sorption in subsoil. The objectives of the present study were therefore to summarize the available literature data on pesticide sorption in subsoils and to test whether a simple alternative model could improve on the standard k(OC) approach used in risk assessment models for pesticide leaching. This model describes the sorption constant as a power law function of the organic carbon content. A database with the results of batch sorption experiments was collated from published studies that emphasized measurements in subsoils. This database contains 1029 data entries from 36 published studies with data for 29 active substances (11 nonionic compounds, 10 weak acids, 6 weak bases, one cation, and one zwitterion). The results show that whereas the constant k(OC) model proved to be an adequate model for 17 of the 63 individual datasets, the power law model gave acceptable fits (p<0.05) for 60 of these cases. The exponent in the power law model varied over a wide range, from slightly negative to near unity. It also differed significantly (p=0.015) for ionized and nonionized compounds, with median values of 0.25 and 0.55, respectively. It is concluded that the power law model could be used to parameterize subsoil sorption in regulatory leaching models, because it has widespread applicability and is simple enough for this purpose. Suitable ways of incorporating this approach in risk assessment procedures are discussed. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:755-761. (c) 2017 SETAC

AB Atrazine toxicity to earthworms is still not fully understood, particularly at sublethal concentrations. Because of the ubiquity of atrazine in the environment, it is imperative to understand the impacts of atrazine presence to soil-dwelling organisms. To examine this in detail, we used H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to elucidate earthworm (Eisenia fetida) responses after 48 h of atrazine exposure in contact tests. Earthworms were exposed to 4 sublethal concentrations of 362.4, 181.2, 90.6, and 45.3 ng/cm(2), which correspond to 1/8th, 1/16th, 1/32nd, and 1/64th of the median lethal concentration (LC50) values, respectively. After exposure, polar metabolites were isolated from earthworm tissues and analyzed using H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Sublethal atrazine exposure induced a nonmonotonic response with respect to exposure concentration and caused an overall suppression in earthworm metabolism. Maltose, fumarate, malate, threonine/lactate, adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP), betaine, scyllo-inositol, glutamate, arginine, and glutamine were the metabolites identified as most sensitive to atrazine exposure. These observed fluctuations in the metabolic profile suggest that atrazine reduced ATP synthesis and negatively impacted the health of earthworms after acute sublethal exposure. Our study also demonstrates the utility of NMR-based metabolomics for the basic assessment of sublethal toxicity, which can then be used for more targeted approaches with other molecular techniques.

AB Photodegradation of 3 commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ketoprofen, carprofen, and diclofenac acid, was conducted under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The kinetic results showed that the 3 pharmaceuticals obeyed the first-order reaction with decreasing rate constants of 1.54x10(-4), 5.91x10(-5), and 7.78x10(-6)s(-1) for carprofen, ketoprofen, and diclofenac acid, respectively. Moreover, the main transformation products were identified by ion-pair liquid-liquid extraction combined with injection port derivatization-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometric analysis. There were 8, 3, and 6 transformation products identified for ketoprofen, carprofen, and diclofenac acid, respectively. Decarboxylation, dechlorination, oxidation, demethylation, esterification, and cyclization were proposed to be associated with the transformation of the 3 pharmaceuticals. Toxicity prediction of the transformation products was conducted on the EPI Suite software based on ECOSAR model, and the results indicate that some of the transformation products were more toxic than the parent compounds. The present study provides the foundation to understand the transformation behavior of the studied pharmaceuticals under UV irradiation. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3232-3239. (c) 2017 SETAC

AB In the present study, we tested whether bioaccumulation in specific tissues of Daphnia magna could explain silver nanoparticle (AgNP) toxicity. Daphnids were exposed to different concentrations of well-suspended AgNPs and AgNO3. The accumulations of Ag in the whole body, gut, and nongut tissues, as well as the mortality of daphnids, were recorded over a period of 7d. Regression analysis showed a higher degree of positive correlation between the concentration of Ag in the nongut tissues than gut tissues and the mortality of daphnids. The results strongly suggested that the toxicity of AgNPs could be better explained in terms of bioaccumulation of AgNPs in the nongut tissues. We further tested the maternal transfer of AgNPs in daphnids into the next generation using radioactive tracers, which were able to detect as low as 1.0 to 3.2% of total accumulated Ag transferred to the neonates. The AgNPs significantly affected the reproduction process during the first 2 broods after exposure, whereas AgNO3 only had significant effects on the first brood. It is possible that AgNPs have longer adverse effects than AgNO3 on the reproduction of Daphnia. The present study identified the sensitive site of AgNP toxic action in daphnids and documented the extent of maternal transfer and the significant influence of AgNPs on the reproduction of daphnids.

AB Engineered nanoparticles are aquatic contaminants of emerging concern that exert ecotoxicological effects on a wide variety of organisms. We exposed cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-capped spherical gold nanoparticles to wood frog and bullfrog tadpoles with conspecifics and in combination with the other species continuously for 21d, then measured uptake and localization of gold. Wood frog tadpoles alone and in combination with bullfrog tadpoles took up significantly more gold than bullfrogs. Bullfrog tadpoles in combination with wood frogs took up significantly more gold than controls. The rank order of weight-normalized gold uptake was wood frogs in combination>wood frogs alone>bullfrogs in combination>bullfrogs alone>controls. In all gold-exposed groups of tadpoles, gold was concentrated in the anterior region compared with the posterior region of the body. The concentration of gold nanoparticles in the anterior region of wood frogs both alone and in combination with bullfrogs was significantly higher than the corresponding posterior regions. We also measured depuration time of gold in wood frogs. After 21d in a solution of gold nanoparticles, tadpoles lost >83% of internalized gold when placed in gold-free water for 5d. After 10d in gold-free water, tadpoles lost 94% of their gold. After 15d, gold concentrations were below the level of detection. Our finding of differential uptake between closely related species living in similar habitats with overlapping geographical distributions argues against generalizing toxicological effects of nanoparticles for a large group of organisms based on measurements in only one species.

AB A total of 71 loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) stranded along the coasts of Sicily (Southern Italy) were examined for non-dioxine like polychlorinated biphenyl (NDL-PCB) levels in muscle and adipose tissue by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method. The results revealed 6 high-indicator congener (Sigma 6PCBIND) levels in 45% of the loggerhead turtles examined, with mean values of 980.39 +/- 2508.39ng/g wet weight in adipose tissue and 102.53 +/- 238.58ng/g wet weight in muscle tissue. The hexachloro and heptachloro PCB congeners were the most abundant in both the sample types. The highest NDL-PCB levels were reached in an adipose tissue sample of a loggerhead turtle of 80kg stranded along the coasts of Termini Imerese (14183.85ng/g wet wt). No significant correlation was found between modified Fulton's K values of the loggerhead turtles and PCB contents (S=47 151, p>0.05). Furthermore, no significant differences were found between sexes (W=365, p> 0.05). The PCB levels found in the present study were much higher than those found in the literature. The present study is the first report on the existence of NDL-PCBs in loggerhead turtles stranded in Sicilian coasts confirming C. caretta as a valuable indicator of contaminant exposure in the marine environment because of their specific biological and ecological characteristics.

AB The use of cell-based assays is essential in reducing the number of vertebrates used in the investigation of chemical toxicities and in regulatory toxicology assessment. An important factor in obtaining meaningful results that can be accurately extrapolated is the use of biologically appropriate cell lines. In the present preliminary study, attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy with multivariate analysis was used to assess the fundamental biomolecular differences between a commonly used cell line, MCF-7 cells, and an environmentally relevant cell line derived from mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) dermal fibroblasts. To better understand differences in basic cell biochemistry, the cells were analyzed in the untreated state or post exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and polybrominated diphenyl ester (PBDE) congeners. The main spectral peaks in spectra from both cell types were associated with cellular macromolecules, particularly proteins and lipids, but the spectra also revealed some cell-specific differences. Spectra from untreated mallard fibroblasts spectra contained a large peak associated with lipids. The cell-related differences in lipids and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) were also identified as regions of spectral alteration induced by PBDE and PCB exposure. Although lipid alterations were observed in post treatment spectra from both cell types, these may be of more significance to mallard fibroblasts, which may be the result of increased intracellular lipid as determined by Nile red staining. Untreated MCF-7 cell spectra contained unique peaks related to DNA and nucleic acids. The DNA-associated spectral regions were also identified as areas of considerable alteration in MCF-7 cells exposed to some congeners including PBDE 47 and PCB 153. The findings indicate that in their native state, MCF-7 and mallard cells have unique biochemical differences, which can be identified using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Such differences in biochemical composition may influence cell susceptibility to environmental contaminants and therefore influence the choice of cell type used in toxicology experiments. To our knowledge, the present study is the first study to analyze the biochemistry of a mallard dermal fibroblast cell line and to use ATR-FTIR spectroscopy for this purpose. Thus ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is demonstrated to be a useful tool for exploration of biomolecular variation at the cellular level and with further development, it could be used as part of a panel of cell-based assays to indicate when different results might be seen in environmental species compared with currently used cell lines.

AB The term resilience describes stress-response patterns across scientific disciplines. In ecology, advances have been made to clearly define resilience based on underlying mechanistic assumptions. Engineering resilience (rebound) is used to describe the ability of organisms to recover from adverse conditions (disturbances), which is termed the rate of recovery. By contrast, the ecological resilience definition considers a systemic change, that is, when ecosystems reorganize into a new regime following disturbance. Under this new regime, structural and functional aspects change considerably relative to the previous regime, without recovery. In this context, resilience is an emergent property of complex systems. In the present study, we argue that both definitions and uses are appropriate in ecotoxicology, and although the differences are subtle, the implications and uses are profoundly different. We discuss resilience concepts in ecotoxicology, where the prevailing view of resilience is engineering resilience from chemical stress. Ecological resilience may also be useful for describing systemic ecological changes because of chemical stress. We present quantitative methods that allow ecotoxicologists and risk managers to assess whether an ecosystem faces an impending regime shift or whether it has already undergone such a shift. We contend that engineering and ecological resilience help to distinguish ecotoxicological responses to chemical stressors mechanistically and thus have implications for theory, policy, and application.

AB We present and evaluate a framework for estimating concentrations of pharmaceuticals over time in wildlife feeding at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The framework is composed of a series of predictive steps involving the estimation of pharmaceutical concentration in wastewater, accumulation into wildlife food items, and uptake by wildlife with subsequent distribution into, and elimination from, tissues. Because many pharmacokinetic parameters for wildlife are unavailable for the majority of drugs in use, a read-across approach was employed using either rodent or human data on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Comparison of the different steps in the framework against experimental data for the scenario where birds are feeding on a WWTP contaminated with fluoxetine showed that estimated concentrations in wastewater treatment works were lower than measured concentrations; concentrations in food could be reasonably estimated if experimental bioaccumulation data are available; and read-across from rodent data worked better than human to bird read-across. The framework provides adequate predictions of plasma concentrations and of elimination behavior in birds but yields poor predictions of distribution in tissues. The approach holds promise, but it is important that we improve our understanding of the physiological similarities and differences between wild birds and domesticated laboratory mammals used in pharmaceutical efficacy/safety trials, so that the wealth of data available can be applied more effectively in ecological risk assessments.

AB Nature of exposure is a fundamental driver in nontarget terrestrial plant risk assessment for pesticides; consequently a novel study was designed to generate field-based drift exposure and evaluate corresponding biological effects of the herbicide mesotrione. The approach used a combination of US guideline drift reduction technology and vegetative vigor approaches. In each of 3 independent replicate spray application trials, 10 pots each of lettuce and tomato were placed at distances of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 ft (similar to 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 m) from the downwind edge of the spray boom. Each application was conducted using a commercial 60-ft (18-m) boom sprayer fitted with TeeJet 1 Technologies TTI110025 nozzles, with a nominal application rate of 0.2 lb a. i./A (224 g a. i./ha). The environmental conditions required by the protocol (air temperature 10-30 degrees C and wind perpendicular to the swath (+/- 30 degrees) blowing toward the plants at a mean wind speed of >= 10 mph [>= 4.5 m/s] measured at 2.0mabove the ground) were met for each application. Following exposure, plants were transferred to a greenhouse for the 21-d vegetative vigor phase of the study. Symptoms of phytotoxicity and plant height were assessed at 7, 14, and 21 d after treatment. On completion of the 21-d after treatment assessment, all plants were harvested and dried in an oven to determine shoot dry weight. The biological data indicated that no statistically significant effects were observed at a distance of 30 ft (similar to 9m) from mesotrione drift at wind speeds of >= 10 mph (10.9-12.4 mph); this endpoint (30 ft) is defined as the no observed effects distance (NOED).

AB Concern about the reproductive toxicity of plant protection products in honey bee reproducers is increasing. Because the reproductive capacity of honey bees is not currently considered during the risk assessment procedure performed during plant protection product registration, it is important to provide methods to assess such potential impairments. To achieve this aim, we used 2 different approaches that involved semifield and laboratory conditions to study the impact of fipronil on drone fertility. For each approach, the drones were reared for 20 d, from emergence to sexual maturity, and exposed to fipronil via a contaminated sugar solution. In both groups, the effects of fipronil were determined by studying life traits and fertility indicators. The results showed that the survival and maturity rates of the drones were better under laboratory conditions than under semifield conditions. Moreover, the drones reared under laboratory conditions produced more seminal fluid. Although these differences could be explained by environmental factors that may vary under semifield conditions, it was found that regardless of the approach used, fipronil did not affect survival rates, maturity rates, or semen volumes, whereas it did affect fertility by inducing a decrease in spermatozoa quantity that was associated with an increase in spermatozoa mortality. These results confirm that fipronil affects drone fertility and support the relevance of each approach for assessing the potential reproductive toxicity of plant protection products in honey bees.

AB Studies of trophodynamics and contaminant bioaccumulation in tropical marine ecosystems are limited. The present study employed stable isotope and trace contaminant analysis to assess sources of primary productivity, trophic interactions, and chemical bioaccumulation behavior in 2 mangrove food webs and 1 offshore coastal marine food web in Singapore. Samples of sediment, phytoplankton, mangrove leaves, clams, snails, crabs, worms, prawns, and fishes were analyzed for stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values, as well as concentrations of persistent organic pollutants. In the mangrove food webs, consumers exhibited similar delta C-13 values, probably because of the well-mixed nature of these systems. However, the 2 primary consumers (common nerite and rodong snail) exhibited distinct delta C-13 values (-21.6% vs -17.7%), indicating different carbon sources. Fish from Singapore Strait exhibited similar delta C-13 values, indicating common carbon sources in this offshore marine food web. The highest trophic level was found in glass perchlet (trophic level = 3.3) and tilapia (trophic level = 3.4) in the 2 mangrove food webs and grunter (trophic level = 3.7) in the Singapore Strait food web. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB 153) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) concentrations ranged from 0.9 to 84.6 ng/g lipid weight and from <0.2 to 267.4 ng/g lipid weight, respectively. The trophic magnification factors of PCB 153 and p,p'-DDE ranged between 1.63 and 4.62, indicating biomagnification in these tropical marine food webs. The findings provide important information that will aid future chemical bioaccumulation assessment initiatives. (C) 2017 SETAC

TI THE ACUTE TOXICITY OF MAJOR ION SALTS TO CERIODAPHNIA DUBIA. II.
   EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIPS IN BINARY SALT MIXTURES
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY

DT Article
DE Aquatic toxicology; Toxicity mechanisms; Concentration addition;
   Independent action; Chemical activity
AB Many human activities increase concentrations of major geochemical ions (Na+1, K+1, Ca+2, Mg+2, Cl-1, SO4-2, and HCO3-1/CO3-2) in freshwater systems, and can thereby adversely affect aquatic life. Such effects involve several toxicants, multiple toxicity mechanisms, various ion interactions, and widely varying ion compositions across different water bodies. Previous studies of individual salt toxicities have defined some useful relationships; however, adding single salts to waters results in atypical compositions and does not fully address mixture toxicity. To better understand mechanisms and interactions for major ion toxicity, 29 binary mixture experiments, each consisting of 7 to 8 toxicity tests, were conducted on the acute toxicity of major ion salts and mannitol to Ceriodaphnia dubia. These tests showed multiple mechanisms of toxicity, including: 1) nonspecific ion toxicity, correlated with osmolarity and to which all ions contribute; and 2) cation-dependent toxicities for potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and calcium (Ca) best related to their chemical activities. These mechanisms primarily operate independently, except for additive toxicity of Mg-dependent and Ca-dependent toxicities. These mixture studies confirmed ameliorative effects of Ca on sodium (Na) and Mg salt toxicities and of Na on K salt toxicity, and further indicated lesser ameliorative effects of Ca on K salt toxicity and Mg on Na salt toxicity. These results provide a stronger basis for assessing risks from the complex mixtures of ions found in surface waters. Published 2016 Wiley Periodicals Inc. on behalf of SETAC.

AB Bees are recognized worldwide for their social, economic, and environmental value. In recent decades they have been seriously threatened by diseases and high levels of pesticide use. The susceptibility of bees to insecticides makes them an important terrestrial model for assessing environmental quality, and various biomarkers have been developed for such assessments. The present study aimed to evaluate the activity of the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CaE), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in Africanized honeybees exposed to fipronil. The results showed that fipronil at a sublethal dose (0.01 ng/bee) modulates the activity of CaE in all isoforms analyzed (CaE-1, CaE-2, and CaE-3) in both newly emerged and aged bees, and does not affect the activity of AChE or GST. The recovery of the bees after fipronil exposure was also investigated, and these results demonstrated that even the cessation of fipronil ingestion might not lead to complete recovery of individual bees. Even at low doses, fipronil was shown to cause changes in the activity of key enzymes in bees. The possible consequences of these changes are discussed. Environ Toxicol Chem (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Diet is an important pathway for metal uptake in marine organisms, and assimilation efficiency is one of the most relevant parameters to quantify trophic transfer of metals along aquatic food webs. The most commonly used method to estimate this parameter is pulse-chase feeding using radiolabeled food. This approach is, however, based on several assumptions that are not always tested in an experimental context. The present study aimed to validate the approach by assessing single-feeding and multiple-feeding approaches, using a model species (the turbot Scophthalmus maximus). Using the kinetic data obtained from the single-feeding experiment, the reconstruction of a multi-feeding experiment was tested for consistency with data provided by an actual multi-feeding performed under the same experimental conditions. The results validated the single-feeding approach. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB In the present study, the effects of low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) on the toxicity of cadmium (Cd) to Eisenia fetida were investigated in a simulated soil solution. The LMWOAs protected E. fetida from Cd toxicity, as indicated by the increased median lethal concentration (LC50) values and the increased activity of superoxide dismutase. In addition, Cd concentrations in E. fetida decreased dramatically in the presence of LMWOAs. These results were likely because of the complexation between Cd and LMWOAs, which decreased the bioavailability and consequential toxicity of Cd to E. fetida. Notably, LMWOAs reduced Cd toxicity in decreasing order (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid [EDTA] > citric acid > oxalic acid > malic acid > acetic acid), which was consistent with the decreasing complexation constants between LMWOAs and Cd. These results advance our understanding of the interactions between Cd and LMWOAs in soil. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB A phototoxic target lipid model (PTLM) is developed to predict phototoxicity of individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) measured either as median lethal concentration (LC50) or median lethal time (LT50) for a 50% toxic response. The model is able to account for the differences in the physical/chemical properties of PAHs, test species sensitivities, and variations in light source characteristics, intensity, and length of exposure. The PTLM is based on the narcotic target lipid model (NTLM) of PAHs. Both models rely on the assumption that mortality occurs when the toxicant concentration in the target lipid of the organism reaches a threshold concentration. The PTLM is applied to observed LC50s and LT50s for 20 individual PAHs, 15 test species-including arthropods, fishes, amphibians, annelids, mollusks, and algae-exposed to simulated solar and various UV light sources, for exposure times varying from less than 1 h to 100 h, a total of 333 observations. The LC50 concentrations range from less than 0.1 mu g/L to greater that 104 mu g/L. The model has 2 fitting parameters that are constant and apply to all PAHs and organisms. The root mean square errors of prediction for log(LC50) and log(LT50) are 0.473 and 0.382, respectively. The results indicate that the PTLM can predict the phototoxicity of single PAHs over a wide range of exposure conditions and to organisms with a wide range of sensitivities. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Contaminant exposure of tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, nesting in 27 Areas of Concern (AOCs) in the Great Lakes basin was assessed from 2010 to 2014 to assist managers and regulators in their assessments of Great Lakes AOCs. Contaminant concentrations in nestlings from AOCs were compared with those in nestlings from nearby non-AOC sites. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and polybrominated diphenyl ether concentrations in tree swallow nestling carcasses at 30% and 33% of AOCs, respectively, were below the mean concentration for non-AOCs. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in nestling stomach contents and perfluorinated compound concentrations in nestling plasma at 67% and 64% of AOCs, respectively, were below the mean concentration for non-AOCs. Concentrations of PCBs in nestling carcasses were elevated at some AOCs but modest compared with highly PCB-contaminated sites where reproductive effects have been documented. Concentrations of PAHs in diet were sufficiently elevated at some AOCs to elicit a measurable physiological response. Among AOCs, concentrations of the perfluorinated compound perfluorooctane sulfonate in plasma were the highest on the River Raisin (MI, USA; geometric mean 330 ng/mL) but well below an estimated toxicity reference value (1700 ng/mL). Both PAH and PCB concentrations in nestling stomach contents and PCBs in carcasses were significantly correlated with concentrations in sediment previously reported, thereby reinforcing the utility of tree swallows to assess bioavailability of sediment contamination.

AB Sediment contamination can pose risks to the environment, and sediment toxicity tests have been developed to isolate the impact of sediment from other factors. Mixtures of contaminants often occur in sediments, and traditional endpoints used in toxicity testing, such as growth, reproduction, and survival, cannot discern the cause of toxicity from chemical mixtures because of complex interactions. In urban waterways, the synthetic pyrethroid bifenthrin and the metal copper are commonly found in mixtures, so the present study was designed to investigate how these contaminants cause toxicity in mixtures. To investigate this, Chironomus tepperi was exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of copper and bifenthrin-spiked sediments in a 2-way factorial mixture for 5 d. Growth and expression profiles of cysteine metabolism genes were measured after exposure. Growth increased at low copper concentrations, decreased at high copper concentrations, and was unaffected by bifenthrin exposures. Copper exposures induced possible cellular repair by upregulating S-adenosylmethionine synthetase expression and downregulating expression of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and cystathionine-beta-synthase. Metallothionein upregulation was also observed. Bifenthrin exposure altered cysteine metabolism to a lesser extent, downregulating cystathionine-beta-synthase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthase. Synergistic, antagonistic, and dose-dependent interactions were observed, and there was evidence of conflicting modes of action and limited substrate production. These findings demonstrate how contextual gene expression changes can be sensitive and specific identifiers of toxicant exposure in mixtures. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Strobilurins constitute a new class of fungicides that is the most widely used in the world. The present study was conducted to investigate the aquatic toxicity of 3 common strobilurin fungicides (kresoxim-methyl, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin) to Daphnia magna. The neonate acute immobilization test showed that the 48-h 50% effective concentration (EC50) values of kresoxim-methyl, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin were 443.3 mu g/L, 20.9 mu g/L, and 23.0 mu g/L, respectively. In addition, the 3 strobilurins significantly induced activity of the important detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) in D. magna, and there was a significant positive relationship between GST activity and immobility of D. magna after acute exposure. The 3 strobilurins showed higher toxicity to D. magna embryos, and the 48-h EC50 were 157.3 mu g/L, 3.9 mu g/L, and 1.7 mu g/L for kresoxim-methyl, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin, respectively. The 21-d chronic test revealed that the strobilurins could also significantly affect the reproduction, development, and growth of D. magna at sublethal concentrations. The lowest-observed-effect concentrations of kresoxim-methyl, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin for reproduction were 20 mu g/L, 0.15 mu g/L, and 0.2 mu g/L, respectively, which were close to environmental concentrations. The findings indicate that strobilurin fungicides are very toxic to D. magna and they are sufficient to cause harm to D. magna at environmentally relevant concentrations.

AB The analysis of metal mixture toxicity to plants is complicated by mutual interactions. In the present study, mixture effects of zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and copper (Cu) on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) root elongation were analyzed using oxidative stress parameters. The hypothesis was that toxic mixture effects on plant growth are better explained by biochemical parameters than by exposure information, because the former excludes interactions among metals for root uptake. Barley seedlings were exposed for 5d or 14d to these metals in nutrient solutions, added in isolation and as mixtures. Root elongation in Cu+Cd mixtures was well predicted from free metal ion concentrations in solution, using concentration addition (CA) or independent action (IA) reference models. In contrast, Zn acted antagonistically when combined with Cu and/or Cd, relative to both CA and IA. This protective effect of Zn correlated with the biomarkers measured in the long-term experiment; oxidative stress (indicated by malondialdehyde level, for example) decreased after addition of Zn. In addition, it was found that some biomarkers were sensitive to both Cu and Cd dosed in isolation, but not to Cu+Cd mixtures. Overall, the exposure explained mixture effects better than most of the 16 measured biomarkers (i.e., the biochemical effects). It is concluded that these biomarkers are not robust indicators for metal mixture toxicity, potentially because different metals have different parallel modes of action on growth that are insufficiently indexed by the biomarkers.

AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of persistent chemicals used for decades in industrial and commercial applications. A key challenge with regard to estimating potential risk to ecological (and human) receptors associated with PFAS exposure lies in the fact that there are many different PFAS compounds and several to many can co-occur in any given environmental sample. We applied a data science approach to characterize and prioritize PFAS and PFAS mixtures from a large dataset of PFAS measurements in surface waters associated with US Air Force Installations with a history of the use of aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs). Several iterations of stakeholder feedback culminated in a few main points that advanced our understanding of a complex dataset and the larger ecotoxicological problem. First, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was often a dominant PFAS in a given surface water sample, frequently followed by perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS). Second, a 4-chemical mixture generally accounted for >80% of the sum of all routinely reported PFAS in a sample, and the most representative 4-chemical mixture was composed of PFOS, PFHxS, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). We suggest that these results demonstrate the utility of formalized data science analysis and assessment frameworks to address complex ecotoxicological problems. Specifically, our example dataset results can be used to provide perspective on toxicity testing, ecological risk assessments, and field studies of PFAS in and around AFFF-impacted sites.

AB Storm events lead to agricultural and urban runoff, to mobilization of contaminated particulate matter, and to input from combined sewer overflows into rivers. We conducted time-resolved sampling during a storm event at the Ammer River, southwest Germany, which is representative of small river systems in densely populated areas with a temperate climate. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) and water from 2 sampling sites were separately analyzed by a multi-analyte liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for 97 environmentally relevant organic micropollutants and with 2 in vitro bioassays. Oxidative stress response (AREc32) may become activated by various stressors covering a broad range of physicochemical properties and induction of aryl hydrocarbon receptor-chemical-activated luciferase gene expression (AhR-CALUX) by hydrophobic compounds such as dioxins and dioxin-like molecules. Compound numbers, concentrations, their mass fluxes, and associated effect fluxes increased substantially during the storm event. Micropollutants detected in water and on SPM pointed toward inputs from combined sewer overflow (e.g., caffeine, paracetamol), urban runoff (e.g., mecoprop, terbutryn), and agricultural areas (e.g., azoxystrobin, bentazone). Particle-facilitated transport of triphenylphosphate and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate accounted for up to 34 and 33% of the total mass flux even though SPM concentrations were Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-12.

AB Fish behavioral responses are sensitive to chemicals in the water. We tested rare minnow tested for their shoal preference, and the shoal (school) factors including nutritional status, body size, and shoal (school) size that can make their preference most stable were measured. Then shoal preference was measured again while fish and shoal were subjected to a concentration gradient of chemicals (cadmium ion [Cd2+], tricaine methanesulfonate [MS222], andp-chloroaniline). The results showed that single rare minnow preferred shoals over blank control tanks. In addition, this preference was most stable when the shoal was well fed and contained 20 individuals 2 cm long. Although there was no significant response after exposure top-chloroaniline, the time spent from entering the tank to start moving decreased greatly at concentrations of Cd2+>3 mg/L and MS222 >11 mg/L. The time the test fish spent close to the shoal significantly decreased at Cd2+>3 mg/L, MS222 >11 mg/L, andp-chloroaniline >10 mg/L, and the frequency of boundary line crossing increased at the same concentrations. The behavioral parameters changed by 20, 5, and 8 min once the lowest-observed-effect concentrations of Cd2+, MS222, andp-chloroaniline, respectively, were added. Our study provides useful information on rare minnow shoal preference that may be used for a biological early warning system.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-10. (c) 2020 SETAC

ID FILM-FORMING FOAM; PERFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES; GROUNDWATER
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are now thought to be far more prevalent in water bodies across the globe than previously reported. In particular, military bases, airports, and industrial sites are prone to contamination caused by runoff discharges from fire-extinguishing waters that contain PFAS such as aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF). These substances and their metabolites show a high degree of mobility as well as a low biotic and abiotic degradability; as a result, they are bioaccumulative and often migrate among the environmental compartments in addition to being toxic. As of now, there is no suitable end-of-life treatment process that is both technologically efficient and cost-effective for the handling of PFAS. Currently, the incineration of the collected extinguishing water at temperatures above 1100 degrees C is the recommended method for the disposal of PFAS to degrade material compounds. However, this method consumes extensive energy because it requires incineration of large quantities of water to treat a diluted fraction of PFAS. Aside from incineration, adsorption of PFAS on granulated activated carbon is one of the most widely used technologies, albeit with poor adsorption and often requiring very large downstream filtration systems. Finally, the application of functional precipitation agents using commercially available cationic surfactants is a novel approach (PerfluorAd (R) [Cornelsen] process) that enables the effective precipitation of PFAS from the spent fire-extinguishing waters. Hence, the goal of the present study was to investigate the environmental impacts emanating from the proper treatment of spent fire-extinguishing water with the aforementioned 3 end-of-life treatment scenarios. A life cycle assessment was conducted for this purpose. The results show that the PerfluorAd process outperforms the other 2 treatment technologies across all environmental impact categories except for ozone depletion.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-11.

   ABSTRACTIONS; POTENTIALS; TERMS
AB A linear free energy model is presented that predicts the second-order rate constant for the abiotic reduction of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs). Previously presented models use the one-electron reduction potentialEH1(ArNO2)of the NAC reactionArNO2+e--> ArNO2 center dot-. IfEH1(ArNO2)is not available, it has been proposed thatEH1(ArNO2)be computed directly or estimated from the gas-phase electron affinity (EA). The model proposed uses the Gibbs free energy of the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactionArNO2+H center dot -> ArNOOH center dot as the parameter in the linear free energy model. Both models employ quantum chemical computations for the required thermodynamic energies. The available and proposed models are compared using experimentally determined second-order rate constants from 5 investigations from the literature in which a variety of NACs were exposed to a variety of reductants. A comprehensive analysis utilizing all the NACs and reductants demonstrate that the HAT energy model and the experimental one-electron reduction potential model have similar root mean square errors and residual error probability distributions. In contrast, the model using the computed EA has a more variable residual error distribution with a significant number of outliers. The results suggest that a linear free energy model utilizing computed HAT reaction free energy produces a more reliable prediction of the NAC abiotic reduction second-order rate constant than previously available methods. The advantages of the proposed HAT energy model and its mechanistic implications are discussed as well.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-7. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Freshwater biofilms play an important role in aquatic ecosystems and are widely used to evaluate environmental conditions. Little is known about the effects of temperature and metals on biofilm fatty acid composition. In the present study, we exposed a natural biofilm cultured in mesocosms to a gradient of nickel (Ni) concentrations at 15 and 21 degrees C for 28 d. Metal bioaccumulation, algal taxonomic composition, and biofilm fatty acid profiles were determined. At both temperatures, bioaccumulated Ni increased with Ni exposure concentration and reached the highest values at 25 mu M Ni, followed by a decrease at 55 and 105 mu M Ni. In control biofilms, palmitic acid (16:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1n7), oleic acid (18:1n9), linoleic acid (18:2n6), and linolenic acid (18:3n3) were the dominant fatty acids at 15 and 21 degrees C. This composition suggests a dominance of cyanobacteria and green algae, which was subsequently confirmed by microscopic observations. The increase in temperature resulted in a decrease in the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, which is considered to be an adaptive response to temperature variation. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) tended to decrease along the Ni gradient, as opposed to saturated fatty acids which increased with Ni concentrations. Temperature and Ni affected differently the estimated desaturase and elongase activities (product/precursor ratios). The increase in PUFAs at 15 degrees C was concomitant to an increase in Delta 9-desaturase (D9D). The estimated activities of D9D, Delta 12-desaturase, and Delta 15-desaturase decreased along the Ni gradient and reflected a decline in PUFAs. The elevated estimated elongase activity reflected the observed increase in saturated fatty acids at the highest Ni exposure concentration (105 mu M). Our results suggest that fatty acids could be used as an endpoint to evaluate environmental perturbations.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-12. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most widespread and potentially toxic contaminants in Great Lakes (USA/Canada) tributaries. The sources of PAHs are numerous and diverse, and identifying the primary source(s) can be difficult. The present study used multiple lines of evidence to determine the likely sources of PAHs to surficial streambed sediments at 71 locations across 26 Great Lakes Basin watersheds. Profile correlations, principal component analysis, positive matrix factorization source-receptor modeling, and mass fractions analysis were used to identify potential PAH sources, and land-use analysis was used to relate streambed sediment PAH concentrations to different land uses. Based on the common conclusion of these analyses, coal-tar-sealed pavement was the most likely source of PAHs to the majority of the locations sampled. The potential PAH-related toxicity of streambed sediments to aquatic organisms was assessed by comparison of concentrations with sediment quality guidelines. The sum concentration of 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority pollutant PAHs was 7.4-196 000 mu g/kg, and the median was 2600 mu g/kg. The threshold effect concentration was exceeded at 62% of sampling locations, and the probable effect concentration or the equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmark was exceeded at 41% of sampling locations. These results have important implications for watershed managers tasked with protecting and remediating aquatic habitats in the Great Lakes Basin.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-17.

AB Mortality of brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and water chemistry were characterized in 6 headwater streams in the western Adirondacks of New York during spring 2015, 2016, and 2017 and compared with results from analogous tests done between 1980 and 2003 in many of the same streams, to assess temporal changes in toxicity and inorganic monomeric aluminum (Al-i) concentrations, and the role of Al-i exposure duration on brook trout survival. The Al-i concentrations of 2 and 4 mu mol L-1 corresponded to low-to-moderate and high mortality thresholds, but prolonged exposure to >= 1 mu mol Al-i L-1 also produced mortality. The variability, mean, and highest Al-i concentrations in Buck Creek year round, and in several other streams during spring, have decreased significantly over the past 3 decades. Logistic models indicate that Al-i surpassed highly toxic concentrations in Buck Creek for 3 to 4 mo annually during 2001 to 2003 and for 2 to 3 wk annually during 2015 to 2017. The loss of extremely high Al-i episodes indicates that toxicity has declined markedly between the 1989 to 1990, 2001 to 2003, and 2015 to 2017 test periods, yet Al-i concentrations can still cause moderate-to-high and complete (100%) mortality. The logistic models illustrate how mortality of brook trout in several Adirondack streams likely decreased in response to the 1990 Amendments to the United States' Clean Air Act (which decreased acidity, Al-i concentrations, and duration of toxic episodes) and offer a means to predict how changes in US regulations that limit emissions of NOx and SOx (and N and S deposition loads) could affect fish survival and stream ecosystems in this region and across the Northeast.

AB Flower-visiting insects (FVIs) are an ecologically diverse group of mobile, flying species that should be protected from pesticide effects according to European policy. However, there is an ongoing decline of FVI species, partly caused by agricultural pesticide applications. Therefore, the risk assessment framework needs to be improved. We synthesized the peer-reviewed literature on FVI groups and their ecology, habitat, exposure to pesticides, and subsequent effects. The results show that FVIs are far more diverse than previously thought. Their habitat, the entire agricultural landscape, is potentially contaminated with pesticides through multiple pathways. Pesticide exposure of FVIs at environmentally realistic levels can cause population-relevant adverse effects. This knowledge was used to critically evaluate the European regulatory framework of exposure and effect assessment. The current risk assessment should be amended to incorporate specific ecological properties of FVIs, that is, traits. We present data-driven tools to improve future risk assessments by making use of trait information. There are major knowledge gaps concerning the general investigation of groups other than bees, the collection of comprehensive data on FVI groups and their ecology, linking habitat to FVI exposure, and study of previously neglected complex population effects. This is necessary to improve our understanding of FVIs and facilitate the development of a more protective FVI risk assessment. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2355-2370. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB An algae population model was applied to describe measured effects of pulsed exposure to chlorotoluron on populations of Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata in 2 laboratory flow-through chemostat tests with different exposure regimes. Both tests enabled evaluation of adverse effects on algae during the exposure and population recovery afterward. Impacts on population densities after chlorotoluron exposure were directly visible as biomass loss in the chemostats. Recovery was observed after each exposure peak. The test results indicate that P. subcapitata is unlikely to show an increased sensitivity to chlorotoluron after pulsed exposure. No altered response or adaptation of the algae to chlorotoluron was observed, with the exception of the last high peak in flow-through test 2. Therefore, an adaptation to the test substance cannot be excluded after long-term exposure. However, recovery to the steady-state level after this peak indicates that the growth rate (fitness) was not significantly reduced in the population with higher tolerance. No differences in chlorotoluron impact on the populations over time in terms of growth were detected. Model predictions agreed well with the measured data. The tests and modeling results validate the model to simulate population dynamics of P. subcapitata after pulsed exposure to chlorotoluron. Model predictions and extrapolations with different exposure patterns are considered reliable for chlorotoluron. The good reproducibility of the population behavior in the test systems supports this conclusion. An example modeled extrapolation of the experimental results to other (untested) exposure scenarios shows a potential approach to using the validated model as a supportive tool in risk assessment.

AB Endocrine-active pharmaceuticals can cause adverse reproductive and developmental effects in nontarget organisms. Aquatic vertebrates may be susceptible to the effects of such pharmaceuticals given that the structure of hormone receptors and the physiology of the endocrine system are highly conserved across vertebrates. To aid in the regulatory review of the environmental impact of drugs, we demonstrate an approach to screen and support the prioritization of pharmaceuticals based on their ability to interact with estrogen receptors (ERs) at environmentally relevant concentrations. Tox21 in vitro results from ER agonist and antagonist assays were retrieved for 1123 pharmaceuticals. In silico predictions from the Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project (CERAPP) models were used to estimate ER agonist and antagonist activity for an additional 170 pharmaceuticals not tested in the Tox21 assay platform. The estrogenic effect ratio (EER) and anti-estrogenic effect ratio (AEER) were calculated by comparing the activity concentration at half-maximal response (AC50) for ER agonism and antagonism, respectively, with estimated pharmaceutical concentrations in fish tissue based on estimates of environmental exposures. A total of 73 and 127 pharmaceuticals were identified as ER agonists and antagonists, respectively. As expected, 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol displayed EERs > 1, and raloxifene and bazedoxifene acetate displayed AEERs > 1, thus indicating that these pharmaceuticals have the potential to reach fish tissue levels that exceed concentrations estimated to interact with ERs. Four pharmaceuticals displayed EERs between 0.1 and 1, and 6 displayed AEERs between 0.1 and 1. This approach may help determine the need for submission of environmental assessment data for new drug applications and support prioritization of pharmaceuticals with the potential to disrupt endocrine signaling in vertebrates.

AB The use of neonicotinoids in agriculture is a critical environmental protection issue. Although there has been considerable research on pollinator exposure and aquatic toxicological effects, few studies have investigated the chronic impacts on soil-dwelling species. Given the application of neonicotinoids into soil systems, there is the potential for risk to soil invertebrates. The toxicity of 2 commercial formulations containing the active ingredients (a.i.) thiamethoxam (Actara 240SC) or clothianidin (Titan (TM)) was investigated using 3 soil invertebrate species: Oppia nitens, Eisenia andrei, and Folsomia candida. No adverse effects were observed for O. nitens at the highest tested concentrations (>= 92 mg a.i./kg dry soil) after a 28-d exposure. Exposure to clothianidin resulted in a 28-d median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.069 (95% confidence limits: 0.039-0.12) mg/kg dry soil for F. candida, and a 56-d IC50 of 0.26 (0.22-3.2) mg a.i./kg dry soil for E. andrei. Exposure to thiamethoxam was less toxic, with IC50s of 0.36 (0.19-0.66) and 3.0 (2.2-4.0) mg a.i./kg dry soil for F. candida and E. andrei reproduction, respectively. The observed toxicity for F. candida adult survival and reproduction and for E. andrei reproduction occurred at environmentally relevant concentrations. However, because clothianidin is a degradation product of thiamethoxam, and detection of clothianidin rose to levels of concern in the thiamethoxam-amended soils over time, the observed toxicity may be partly attributed to the presence of clothianidin.

AB Heavy metals are rich in seleniferous areas; however, the bioaccumulation and health risk of heavy metals are poorly understood, given the fact that selenium (Se) can inhibit the phytotoxicity and bioavailability of many heavy metals. The present study investigated the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in the soil-rice system in the Enshi seleniferous area of central China. Soils were contaminated by Mo, Cu, As, Sb, Zn, Cd, Tl, and Hg caused by the weathering of Se-rich shales. Among these heavy metals, Cd and Mo had the highest bioavailability in soils. The bioavailable fractions of Cd and Mo accounted for 41.84 and 10.75% of the total Cd and Mo in soils, respectively. Correspondingly, much higher bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of Cd (0.34) and Mo (0.46) were found in rice, compared with those of other heavy metals (Zn 0.16, Cu 0.05, Hg 0.04, and Sb 0.0002). For the first time-to our knowledge-we showed that the uptake of Hg, Cd, and Cu by rice could be inhibited by the presence of Se in the soil. The probable daily intake (PDI) of Se, Cd, Mo, Zn, and Cu through consumption of local rice was 252 +/- 184, 314 +/- 301, and 1774 +/- 1326 mu g/d; and 7.4 +/- 1.68 and 0.87 +/- 0.35 mg/d, respectively. The high hazard quotients (HQs) of Mo (1.97 +/- 1.47) and Cd (5.22 +/- 5.02) suggested a high risk of Cd and Mo for Enshi residents through consumption of rice.

AB The organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos has been introduced to the marine environment via adsorption to agricultural soil runoff or as spray drift. Chlorpyrifos affects the survival of some larval decapod crustaceans, but no data exist on the impacts to the American lobster, Homarus americanus. The purpose of the present study was to assess the levels at which chlorpyrifos affects the survival of postlarval H. americanus. Using acute saltwater exposures, the 24- and 48-h median lethal concentrations were established for stage IV H. americanus (1.56 and 1.33 mu g/L, respectively). Movement, acetylcholinesterase activity, intermoult period, specific growth rate, and moult increment were measured during exposure to sublethal concentrations. Movement patterns were assessed to establish a 48-h median inhibition concentration for cessation of normal movement (0.66 mu g/L). Acetylcholinesterase activity was found to be inhibited immediately post-exposure to 0.50, 0.57, and 0.82 mu g/L chlorpyrifos but could be recovered within a period (9-15 d) in clean seawater. Sublethal growth effects of increased intermoult period, decreased specific growth rate, and decreased moult increment were observed during exposure to an environmentally relevant concentration (0.82 mu g/L). The present study suggests that H. americanus stage IV larvae were marginally less sensitive to chlorpyrifos compared with other decapods and that acute lethality of H. americanus postlarvae is not likely to occur with chlorpyrifos concentrations previously reported from aquatic environments.

AB Neonicotinoid insecticides that have been on the market since 1992 have been used globally including in Japan. Because they are sprayed over forests and agricultural areas, inadvertent toxicity in nontarget insects (especially honey bees) and humans is a matter of public concern. However, information on exposure levels and potential health impacts of neonicotinoids in children living around sprayed areas is scarce. Thus, we determined neonicotinoid exposure levels in children living in communities where thiacloprid was used to control pine wilt disease. A total of 46 children (23 males and 23 females) were recruited for the present study, and informed written consent was obtained from their guardians. Urine specimens were collected before, during, and after insecticide spraying events; and atmospheric particulate matter was also collected. Concentrations of thiacloprid and 6 other neonicotinoid compounds were determined in urine samples and in atmospheric particulate matter specimens using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. In urine specimens, thiacloprid concentrations were <0.13 mu g/L and were detectable in approximately 30% of all samples. Concentrations of the other neonicotinoids, N-dm-acetamiprid, thiamethoxam, dinotefuran, and clothianidin, were 18.7, 1.92, 72.3, and 6.02 mu g/L, respectively. Estimated daily intakes of these neonicotinoids were then calculated from urinary levels; although the estimated daily intakes of the neonicotinoids were lower than current acceptable daily intake values, the children were found to be exposed to multiple neonicotinoids on a daily basis.

AB The aim of the present study was to determine the influence of salinity and organism age on the chronic toxicity of waterborne lead (Pb) to Atherinops affinis and to compare the relative Pb sensitivity of A. affinis with other marine species. Chronic Pb exposure experiments were conducted in a water flow-through testing system. Survival, standard length, dry weight, and tissue Pb concentration were measured and lethal concentrations (LCs), effect concentrations (ECs), and bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were calculated. In general, increasing salinity and organism age decreased Pb toxicity. The LC50s for larval fish at 14 and 28 ppt salinity were 15.1 and 79.8g/L dissolved Pb, respectively; whereas, the LC50 for juvenile fish was 167.6g/L dissolved Pb at 28 ppt salinity. Using standard length data, the EC10 values for larval fish were 16.4 and 82.4g/L dissolved Pb at 14 and 28 ppt salinity, respectively. The dry weight EC25s for low and high salinity were 15.6 and 61.84g/L dissolved Pb, respectively. The BCFs were higher with the lower salinity study (1703) in comparison to the higher salinity study (654). Results of Pb speciation calculation showed higher fraction of Pb2+ in water with lower salinity, explaining the higher observed toxicity of Pb in lower salinity water than higher salinity water. Atherinops affinis is more sensitive to Pb than several other marine species. Evidence of abnormal swimming and skeletal deformities were observed in Pb exposure treatments. Results of the present study are useful for marine biotic ligand modeling and support ecological risk assessment and deriving Pb environmental quality criteria for marine environments.

AB To protect house facades from fouling by microorganisms, biocides can be added to a render or paint before it is applied. During driving rain events, these biocides gradually leach out and have the potential to pollute soil or aquatic ecosystems. We studied the leaching behavior of biocides and toxicity of leachates from renders with either free or encapsulated biocides. Both render types contained equal amounts of terbutryn, 2-octyl-3(2H)-isothiazolinone (OIT), and 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolino-3-one (DCOIT). Nine leachate samples were generated over 9 immersion cycles according to a European standard, and biocides were quantified. The first and ninth leachate samples were tested using bioassays with algae, bacteria, and water fleas, the first sample was also tested with earthworms and springtails. Encapsulation reduced leaching of terbutryn, OIT, and DCOIT by 4-, 17-, and 27-fold. For aquatic organisms, the toxicity of water from render containing encapsulated biocides was always lower than that of render with free biocides. Furthermore, toxicity decreased by 4- to 5-fold over the 9 immersion cycles. Inhibition of photosynthesis was the most sensitive endpoint, followed by algal growth rate, bacterial bioluminescence, and water flea reproduction. Toxicity to algae was due to terbutryn and toxicity to bacteria was due to OIT. None of the samples affected soil organisms. Results demonstrate that combining standardized leaching tests with standardized bioassays is a promising approach to evaluate the ecotoxicity of biocides that leach from facade renders.

AB Fish early life stage (ELS) tests (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development test guideline 210) are widely conducted to estimate chronic fish toxicity. In these tests, fish are exposed from the embryonic to the juvenile life stages. To analyze whether certain modes of action are related to high toxic ratios (i.e., ratios between baseline toxicity and experimental effect) and/or acute-to-chronic ratios (ACRs) in the fish ELS test, effect concentrations (ECs) for 183 compounds were extracted from the US Environmental Protection Agency's ecotoxicity database. Analysis of ECs of narcotic compounds indicated that baseline toxicity could be observed in the fish ELS test at similar concentrations as in the acute fish toxicity test. All nonnarcotic modes of action were associated with higher toxic ratios, with median values ranging from 4 to 9.3 x 10(4) (uncoupling < reactivity < neuromuscular toxicity < methemoglobin formation < endocrine disruption < extracellular matrix formation inhibition). Four modes of action were also found to be associated with high ACRs: 1) lysyl oxidase inhibition leading to notochord distortion, 2) putative methemoglobin formation or hemolytic anemia, 3) endocrine disruption, and 4) compounds with neuromuscular toxicity. For the prediction of ECs in the fish ELS test with alternative test systems, endpoints targeted to the modes of action of compounds with enhanced toxic ratios or ACRs could be used to trigger fish ELS tests or even replace these tests.

AB Some fluorochemical products are manufactured using N-methyl perfluorobutanesulfonamido ethanol (MeFBSE), a short-chain replacement for perfluorooctyl-based chemistries N-methyl and N-ethyl perfluorooctanesulfonamido ethanols (EtFOSE). The present study shows for the first time the anaerobic biodegradation of MeFBSE and EtFOSE in municipal digester sludge under methanogenic conditions. Both MeFBSE and EtFOSE were incubated for 108 d with anaerobic digester sludge. Although sterile controls did not remove MeFBSE, it was degraded in live sludge. The loss of MeFBSE coincided with production of N-methyl perfluorobutanesulfonamido acetate (MeFBSAA) and perfluorobutane sulfinate (PFBSI). The biodegradation appeared biphasic, with pseudo first-order loss between days 0 and 70, resulting in approximately 75% removal but no further depletion of MeFBSE between days 70 and 108. By day 108 MeFBSAA and PFBSI accounted for 57 and 40 mol% of initial dose, respectively. Mass balance values in live cultures on days 0, 10, 21, 29, 70, and 108 were 103, 92, 94, 100, 93, and 122%, respectively. The apparent first-order biodegradation rate constant for MeFBSE over the first 70 d was 0.0194 d(-1), and the apparent half-life was 35.8 d. Incubation of EtFOSE with live digester sludge resulted in low-level formation of N-ethyl perfluorooctane-sulfonamido acetate and perfluorooctane sulfinate, which did not form in sterile controls. Although it was not measurably lost, 2 to 3% loss of EtFOSE was calculated based on product concentrations. The total product formation rate constant was determined by first-order kinetic evaluation over the first 72 d to estimate a first-order biodegradation rate constant for EtFOSE at 0.000374 d(-1), and the apparent half-life time was 1860 d.

AB Benthic periphytic biofilms are important food sources at the base of aquatic ecosystems. These biofilms also sit at the interface of oxic waters and hypoxic sediments, and can be influenced by or influence trace element speciation. In the present study, we compared arsenic (As) enrichment in periphyton exposed to arsenate (As[V]) or arsenite (As[III]) (20g/L, static renewal, 7 d), and we found similar accumulation patterns of total As (101 +/- 27 and 88 +/- 22mg kg(-1) dry wt, respectively). Periphyton As was 6281- and 6684-fold higher than their aqueous exposures and occurred primarily as As(V). When these biofilms were fed to larval mayflies, similar total As tissue concentrations (13.9 and 14.6mg kg(-1) dry wt, respectively) were observed, revealing significant biodilution (approximate to 10% of their dietary concentrations). Finally, we investigated the influence of aeration and periphyton presence on As speciation in solutions and solid phases treated with As(III). Predominantly As(III) solutions were slowly oxidized over a 7-d time period, in the absence of periphyton, and aeration did not strongly affect oxidation rates. However, in the presence of periphyton, solution and solid-phase analyses (by microscale x-ray absorption spectroscopy) showed rapid As(III) oxidation to As(V) and an increasing proportion of organo-As forming over time. Thus periphyton plays several roles in As environmental behavior: 1) decreasing total dissolved As concentrations via abiotic and biotic accumulation, 2) rapidly oxidizing As(III) to As(V), 3) effluxing organo-As forms into solution, and 4) limiting trophic transfer to aquatic grazers.

AB Although metal mixture toxicity has been studied relatively intensely, there is no general consensus yet on how to incorporate metal mixture toxicity into aquatic risk assessment. We combined existing data on chronic metal mixture toxicity at the species level with species sensitivity distribution (SSD)-based in silico metal mixture risk predictions at the community level for mixtures of Ni, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb, to develop a tiered risk assessment scheme for metal mixtures in freshwater. Generally, independent action (IA) predicts chronic metal mixture toxicity at the species level most accurately, whereas concentration addition (CA) is the most conservative model. Mixture effects are noninteractive in 69% (IA) and 44% (CA) and antagonistic in 15% (IA) and 51% (CA) of the experiments, whereas synergisms are only observed in 15% (IA) and 5% (CA) of the experiments. At low effect sizes (approximate to 10% mixture effect), CA overestimates metal mixture toxicity at the species level by 1.2-fold (i.e., the mixture interaction factor [MIF]; median). Species, metal presence, or number of metals does not significantly affect the MIF. To predict metal mixture risk at the community level, bioavailability-normalization procedures were combined with CA or IA using SSD techniques in 4 different methods, which were compared using environmental monitoring data of a European river basin (the Dommel, The Netherlands). We found that the simplest method, in which CA is directly applied to the SSD (CA(SSD)), is also the most conservative method. The CA(SSD) has median margins of safety (MoS) of 1.1 and 1.2 respectively for binary mixtures compared with the theoretically more consistent methods of applying CA or IA to the dose-response curve of each species individually prior to estimating the fraction of affected species (CA(DRC) or IA(DRC)). The MoS increases linearly with an increasing number of metals, up to 1.4 and 1.7 for quinary mixtures (median) compared with CA(DRC) and IA(DRC), respectively. When our methods were applied to a geochemical baseline database (Forum of European Geological Surveys [FOREGS]), we found that CA(SSD) yielded a considerable number of mixture risk predictions, even when metals were at background levels (8% of the water samples). In contrast, metal mixture risks predicted with the theoretically more consistent methods (e.g., IA(DRC)) were very limited under natural background metal concentrations (<1% of the water samples). Based on the combined evidence of chronic mixture toxicity predictions at the species level and evidence of in silico risk predictions at the community level, a tiered risk assessment scheme for evaluating metal mixture risks is presented, with CA(SSD) functioning as a first, simple conservative tier. The more complex, but theoretically more consistent and most accurate method, IA(DRC), can be used in higher tier assessments. Alternatively, the conservatism of CA(SSD) can be accounted for deterministically by incorporating the MoS and MIF in the scheme. Finally, specific guidance is also given related to specific issues, such as how to deal with nondetect data and complex mixtures that include so-called data-poor metals.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are persistent pollutants present in the environment with known mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. In the present study the effects of exposure to single or multiple doses of benzo[a]anthracene (BaA), pyrene (Pyr), and 3 halogenated derivatives of these compounds (1-chloropyrene, 1-bromopyrene [1-BrPyr], and 7-chlorobenzo[a]anthracene [7-ClBaA]) were evaluated in a liver-derived human cell line (HepG2). Cytotoxicity as assessed by the classic 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and neutral red assays showed a mild toxic effect in response to single or multiple dose exposure for up to 72h, except for multiple dose exposure to BaA and 7-ClBaA (1M/d for 4 d) and single exposure to 10M BaA. Furthermore, selective mitochondrial and lysosomal toxicity was observed for Pyr and BaA series, respectively. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for this effect, reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, lysosomal pH, DNA fragmentation, and early and late apoptosis mediators were evaluated after exposure to single doses of the compounds. All compounds were able to trigger oxidative stress after 24h as measured by catalase activity, and a good correlation was found between mitochondrial membrane depolarization, lysosomal pH increase, and MTT and neutral red assays. Evaluation of cell death mediators showed that caspase-3/7, but not annexin-V, pathways were involved in toxicity triggered by the studied compounds. The integration of all results showed that 1-BrPyr and BaA have a higher toxicity potential. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3404-3414. (c) 2017 SETAC

AB Glyphosate is a widely used broad-spectrum postemergent herbicide used for weed control in both agricultural and nonagricultural settings. Spray drift of glyphosate can pose a risk to nontarget terrestrial plants and plant communities outside the intended area of application, but the lack of a well-established predicted-no-effect drift rate makes properly assessing such risk difficult. For this reason, a literature review and meta-analysis was carried out with the aim to determine the level of drift that is likely to cause harm to plants and to explore what spray-reducing targets would be sufficiently protective. No-observed-adverse effect rates, lowest-observed-adverse effect rates, and effect rates giving 10, 25, and 50% effects were extracted from a total of 39 different publications. The data were combined per species, and species sensitivity distributions were constructed and fitted with a log-logistic model to assess protectiveness. No systematic differences were detected between the responses of monocotyledons or dicotyledons, but wild plants were found to be generally less sensitive to glyphosate drift than domesticated plants. The results indicate that restricting spray drift to a level below 5g a.e./ha would protect approximately 95% of all higher plant species against minor adverse effects of glyphosate drift and that rates below 1 to 2g a.e./ha would be almost completely protective. No studies were encountered that evaluated effects of spray drift against nonvascular plants, and therefore, the conclusions are only valid for vascular plants.

AB The aging of metals added to soil is significant in ecological risk assessment and the derivation of soil environmental quality criteria. Semimechanistic aging models have been developed for some metals, but not for zinc (Zn). In the present study, a published dataset detailing the changes in isotopic exchangeability with time, after water-soluble Zn was added to 23 soils and incubated for 813 d, was used to analyze the effect of soil properties on aging and develop empirical and mechanistic models. Aging was mainly controlled by soil pH, probably because of precipitation, and was linearly correlated with the square root of incubation time, probably as a result of diffusion. Based on precipitation, diffusion, and/or occlusion, semimechanistic aging models were developed using a Zn hydrolysis constant of 6.52 to 6.61, apparent diffusion rate coefficient (D/r(2)) of 1.41x10(-5)/d, and a root mean square error of less than 15%. The optimized models were accurately validated by 4 independent field-incubated soils, with different doses of Zn under different conditions (the differences between measured and predicted isotopically exchangeable Zn were less than 10%). This enabled an understanding of the long-term behavior of Zn added to soils, and the results can be used for environmental risk assessments and the normalization of ecotoxicity datasets in the derivation of soil environmental quality criteria.

AB Lithium intercalation compounds such as lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) and lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) are used extensively in lithium batteries. Because there is currently little economic incentive for recycling, chances are greater that batteries will end up in landfills or waste in the environment. In addition, the toxicity of these battery materials traditionally has not been part of the design process. Therefore, to determine the environmental impact and the possibility of alternative battery materials, representative complex battery nanomaterials, LCO and NMC, were synthesized, and toxicity was assessed in Daphnia magna. Toxicity was determined by assessing LCO and NMC at concentrations in the range of 0.1 to 25 mg/L. Acute studies (48 h) showed no effect to daphnid survival at 25 mg/L, whereas chronic studies (21 d) show significant impacts to daphnid reproduction and survival at concentrations of 0.25 mg/L for LCO and 1.0 mg/L for NMC. Dissolved metal exposures showed no effect at the amounts measured in suspension, and supernatant controls could not reproduce the effects of the particles, indicating a nanomaterial-specific impact. Genes explored in the present study were actin, glutathione-s-transferase, catalase, 18s, metallothionein, heat shock protein, and vitellogenin. Down-regulation of genes important in metal detoxification, metabolism, and cell maintenance was observed in a dose-dependent manner. The results show that battery material chemical composition can be altered to minimize environmental impacts. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Aquatic herbicides are used to manage invasive emergent plants in and around wetlands. Metamorphic frogs that emerge during the aquatic weed management season may be at risk of herbicide exposure. Metamorphic northern red-legged frogs (Rana aurora) were exposed to a triclopyr tank mix labeled for control of broadleaf emergent aquatic weeds such as invasive purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria). The tank mix consisted of Renovate (R) 3 (triclopyr triethylamine salt 44.4%), the modified vegetable oil surfactant Competitor (R), and the marker dye Hi-Light (R). Metamorphs were exposed to the tank mix and a clean-water control for 96 h, and then reared in clean water for 60 d. Exposure to the tank mix resulted in no treatment-related mortalities, no effects on behavior immediately post exposure, and no effects on body or liver condition indices. Exposure to the tank mix resulted in lethargy during exposure and a 1-d delay in completion of metamorphosis. Deformities present in the rearing population confounded results for some endpoints. Observed effects were minimal, especially compared with the potential for ecological impacts from unmanaged invasive plants. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB A growing body of evidence suggests that amending soil with biosolids can be an integral component of sustainable agriculture. Despite strong evidence supporting its beneficial use in agriculture, there are concerns that chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, could present a risk to terrestrial ecosystems and human health. Triclosan is one of the most commonly detected compounds in biosolids. To date, laboratory studies indicate that triclosan likely poses a de minimis risk to field crops; however, these studies were either conducted under unrealistic exposure conditions or only assessed 1 or 2 formulations of biosolids. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the effects of triclosan on field crops in soils amended with 4 different formulations of biosolids (liquid, dewatered, compost, and alkaline-hydrolyzed), containing both background and spiked triclosan concentrations, following best management practices used in the province of Ontario. Three crop species (corn, soybean, and spring wheat) were evaluated using several plant growth endpoints (e.g., root wet mass, shoot length, shoot wet/dry mass) in 70-d to 90-d potted soil tests. The results indicated no adverse impact of triclosan on any crop-biosolids combination. Conversely, amending soil with biosolids either enhanced or had no negative effect, on the growth of plants. Results of the present study suggest little risk of triclosan to crops in agricultural fields amended with biosolids. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Zinc (Zn) and arsenic (As) are typically present as mixed contaminants in mining-impacted areas; however, their joined effects have rarely been evaluated. The present study was set up to test whether the Zn2+ and H2AsO4- (hereafter, As) mixture toxicity to plants is additive or whether interactions occur. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) root elongation was measured in resin buffered nutrient solutions. The design included ranges of single-element concentrations and combinations at 3 different Ca2+ concentrations (0.5 mM, 2.2 mM, and 15.0mM) to vary the relative toxicity of Zn2+. Increasing Ca concentrations decreased Zn toxicity, whereas As toxicity was unaffected by Ca. Root elongation was generally more affected in Zn-As mixtures than in corresponding single-element treatments. This is merely a joint additive effect, as 96% of the root elongation data were within a factor of 1.2 from predictions using the independent action (IA) or concentration addition (CA) model. The CA and IA predictions were similar, and data did not allow identification of equal or dissimilar modes of action. Small but significant Zn-As antagonisms were only found at high effects (>50% inhibition). The present study suggests that mixture effects of Zn and As are environmentally relevant and that current risk assessment underestimates toxicity in multielement-contaminated environments. The CA model can be used as a conservative model for risk assessment; however, for soil-grown plants, soilexposed studies are needed. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Models and data from the North Pacific Ocean indicate that mercury concentrations in water and biota are increasing in response to (global or hemispheric) anthropogenic mercury releases. In the present study, we provide an updated record of mercury in yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) caught near Hawaii that confirms an earlier conclusion that mercury concentrations in these fish are increasing at a rate similar to that observed in waters shallower than 1000 m. We also compiled and reanalyzed data from bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) caught near Hawaii in the 1970s and 2000s. Increases in mercury concentrations in bigeye tuna are consistent with the trend found in yellowfin tuna, in both timing and magnitude. The data available for blue marlin do not allow for a fair comparison among years, because mercury concentrations differ between sexes for this species, and sex was identified (or reported) in only 3 of 7 studies. Also, mercury concentrations in blue marlin may be insensitive to modest changes in mercury exposure, because this species appears to have the ability to detoxify mercury. The North Pacific Ocean is a region of both relatively high rates of atmospheric mercury deposition and capture fisheries production. Other data sets that allow temporal comparisons in mercury concentrations, such as pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) in Alaskan waters and albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) off the US Pacific coast, should be explored further, to aid in understanding human health and ecological risks and to develop additional baseline knowledge for assessing changes in a region expected to respond strongly to reductions in anthropogenic mercury emissions.

AB The present study investigated the distribution and environmental fate of Bisphenol A (BPA), the 4-hydroxyacetophenone (4-HAP) metabolite, and 5 other bisphenol congeners in 2 municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and their receiving rivers in Romania. Accordingly, a new, highly sensitive and accurate solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated. This technique generated low limit of quantitation values: below 2.3 ng/L for surface water and less than 2.4 and 2.7 ng/L for WWTP effluent and influent water. The sum of detected analytes in wastewater was between 1337 and 16 118 ng/L for influent samples and between 15 and 96 ng/L for effluent samples. In surface water, the total of all compounds was somewhere between 34 and 240 ng/L. The highest concentration observed was for BPA in all 3 types of analyzed water (up to 9140 ng/L for influent, as high as 75 ng/L for effluent, and a maximum of 135 ng/L in surface waters). All analyzed samples were free of bisphenols B, C, and F. For all analytes detected in surface water, the concentration values were higher than those determined in the effluent samples, which may be caused by intrinsic contamination of the 2 rivers (Danube and Jiu Rivers). Values of environmental risk coefficients, calculated for both effluents and surface waters, indicated a low ecological risk or no ecological risk for 3 types of organisms (algae, daphnia, and fish). Human risk assessment calculation suggests no risk to human health as a result of the presence of BPA in either of the 2 rivers. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-12. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB There are various differences in size, behavior, and life history traits of non-Apis bee species compared with honey bees (Apis mellifera; Linnaeus, 1758). Currently, the risk assessment for bees in the international and national process of authorizing plant protection products has been based on honey bee data as a surrogate organism for non-Apis bees. To evaluate the feasibility of a semifield tunnel test for Osmia bicornis (Linnaeus, 1758) and Osmia cornuta (Latreille, 1805), a protocol was developed by the non-Apis working group of the International Commission for Plant-Pollinator Relationships, consisting of experts from authorities, academia, and industry. A total of 25 studies were performed over a 2-yr period testing a replicated control against a replicated positive control using either a dimethoate or diflubenzuron treatment. Studies were regarded to be valid, if >= 30% of released females were found to occupy the nesting units in the night/morning before the application (establishment). Thirteen studies were regarded to be valid and were analyzed further. Parameters analyzed were nest occupation, flight activity, cell production (total and per female), cocoon production (total and per female), emergence success, sex ratio, and mean weight of females and males. Dimethoate was a reliable positive control at the tested rate of 75 g a.i./ha, once >30% females had established, displaying acute effects such as reduction in flight activity, increase in adult mortality (shown by nest occupation), and reproduction ability of the females (total cell and cocoon production). On the other hand, no effects on larval and pupal development were observed. The growth regulator diflubenzuron had statistically significant effects on brood development, causing mortality of eggs and larvae at a rate of approximately 200 g a.i./ha, whereas fenoxycarb did not cause any significant effects at the tested rates of 300 and 600 g a.i./ha. In conclusion, the ring-test protocol proved to be adequate once the study comprised a well-established population of female Osmia bees, and the results improved in the second year as the laboratories increased their experience with the test organism. It is noted that the success of a study strongly depends on the experience of the experimenter, the crop quality, the quality of the cocoons, and the weather conditions. Based on these finding, recommendations for a semifield study design with Osmia spp. are proposed. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-15. (c) 2020 The Authors.

AB Lead poisoning of scavenging birds is a global issue. However, the drivers of lead exposure of avian scavengers have been understood from the perspective of individual species, not cross-taxa assemblages. We analyzed blood (n = 285) and liver (n = 226) lead concentrations of 5 facultative (American crows [Corvus brachyrhynchos], bald eagles [Haliaeetus leucocephalus], golden eagles [Aquila chrysaetos], red-shouldered hawks [Buteo lineatus], and red-tailed hawks [Buteo jamaicensis]) and 2 obligate (black vultures [Coragyps atratus] and turkey vultures [Cathartes aura] avian scavenger species to identify lead exposure patterns. Species and age were significant (alpha < 0.05) predictors of blood lead exposure of facultative scavengers; species, but not age, was a significant predictor of their liver lead exposure. We detected temporal variations in lead concentrations of facultative scavengers (blood: median = 4.41 mu g/dL in spring and summer vs 13.08 mu g/dL in autumn and winter; p = p = <0.001). At the species level, we detected between-period differences in blood lead concentrations of bald eagles (p = 0.01) and red-shouldered hawks during the winter (p = 0.001). During summer, obligate scavengers had higher liver lead concentrations than did facultative scavengers (median = 1.76 ppm vs 0.22 ppm; p = <0.001). These data suggest that the feeding ecology of avian scavengers is a determinant of the degree to which they are lead exposed, and they highlight the importance of dietary and behavioral variation in determining lead exposure.

AB Monitoring the adverse effects of environmental contaminants on the reproduction of invertebrate species in the field remains a challenge in aquatic ecotoxicology. To meet the need for reliable tools for in situ toxicity assessment, we present the first part of a methodological study of the in situ implementation of a reproductive bioassay in Gammarus previously developed for screening the toxicity of chemical compounds during laboratory exposure. To ensure the correct interpretation of the modulation of reproductive markers (molting, fecundity, follicle growth, and embryonic development) in uncontrolled environmental conditions, we experimentally assessed and statistically modeled the variability in the female reproductive cycle during laboratory exposure under several temperature and water hardness conditions. Whereas water hardness did not influence the reproductive cycle, the significant accelerating effect of temperature on the dynamics of molting and marsupial development was finely modeled, by detailing the influence of temperature on the probability of transition between all molt and embryonic stages along the female cycle. In addition, no effect of temperature or water hardness was detected on the number of oocytes and embryos carried by females. Furthermore, the finding that the relative durations of the first 4 molt and embryonic stages are constant whatever the temperature makes it possible to predict the molting dynamics in fluctuating temperature conditions. Because this could allow us to take into account the confounding influence of temperature on the measurement of reproductive markers, the implications of these findings for an optimal in situ implementation of the reproductive bioassay with G. fossarum are discussed. The relevance of this modeling approach during in situ implementation is tested in a companion study. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-11. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) supports a large aquaculture industry and is a keystone species along the Atlantic seaboard. Native oysters are routinely exposed to a complex mixture of contaminants that increasingly includes pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Unfortunately, the biological effects of chemical mixtures on oysters are poorly understood. Untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics was utilized to quantify the response of oysters exposed to fluoxetine, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, diphenhydramine, and their mixture. Oysters were exposed to 1 mu g/L of each chemical or mixture for 10 d, followed by an 8-d depuration period. Adductor muscle (n = 14/treatment) was sampled at days 0, 1, 5, 10, and 18. Trajectory analysis illustrated that metabolic effects and class separation of the treatments varied at each time point and that, overall, the oysters were only able to partially recover from these exposures post-depuration. Altered metabolites were associated with cellular energetics (i.e., Krebs cycle intermediates), as well as amino acid metabolism and fatty acids. Exposure to these PPCPs also affected metabolic pathways associated with anaerobic metabolism, osmotic stress, and oxidative stress, in addition to the physiological effects of each chemical's postulated mechanism of action. Following depuration, fewer metabolites were altered, but none of the treatments returned them to their initial control values, indicating that metabolic disruptions were long-lasting. Interestingly, the mixture did not directly cluster with individual treatments in the scores plot from partial least squares discriminant analysis, and many of its affected metabolic pathways were not well predicted from the individual treatments. The present study highlights the utility of untargeted metabolomics in developing exposure biomarkers for compounds with different modes of action in bivalves. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-18.

AB Engineered aluminum oxide nanoparticles (Al2O3 NPs) having high-grade thermal stability and water-dispersion properties are extensively used in different industries and personal care products. Toxicological response evaluation of these NPs is indispensable in assessing the health risks and exposure limits because of their industrial disposal into the aquatic environment. We assessed and compared the developmental toxicity of Al2O3 NPs in Xenopus laevis and Danio rerio over a period of 96 h using the frog embryo teratogenic assay Xenopus and a fish embryo toxicity assay. Engineered Al2O3 NP exposure produced dose-dependent embryonic mortality and decreased the embryo length, indicating a negative effect on growth. Moreover, Al2O3 NPs induced various malformations, such as small head size, a bent/deformed axis, edema, and gut malformation, dose-dependently and altered the expression of heart- and liver-specific genes in both X. laevis and D. rerio, as revealed by whole-mount in-situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the toxicological data suggest that Al2O3 NPs are developmentally toxic and teratogenic and negatively affect the embryonic development of X. laevis and D. rerio. Our study can serve as a model for the toxicological evaluation of nanomaterial exposure on vertebrate development that is critical to ensure human and environmental safety.

AB A lack of standard and internationally agreed procedures for higher-tier risk assessment of plant protection products for bees makes coherent availability of data, their interpretation, and their use for risk assessment challenging. Focus has been given to the development of modeling approaches, which in the future could fill this gap. The BEEHAVE model, and its submodels, is the first model framework attempting to link 2 processes vital for the assessment of bee colonies: the within-hive dynamics for honey bee colonies and bee foraging in heterogeneous and dynamic landscapes. We use empirical data from a honey bee field study to conduct a model evaluation using the control data set. Simultaneously, we are testing several model setups for the interlinkage between the within-hive dynamics and the landscape foraging module. Overall, predictions of beehive dynamics fit observations made in the field. This result underpins the European Food Safety Authority's evaluation of the BEEHAVE model that the most important in-hive dynamics are represented and correctly implemented. We show that starting conditions of a colony drive the simulated colony dynamics almost entirely within the first few weeks, whereas the impact is increasingly substituted by the impact of foraging activity. Common among field studies is that data availability for hive observations and landscape characterizations is focused on the proportionally short exposure phase (i.e., the phase where colony starting conditions drive the colony dynamics) in comparison to the postexposure phase that lasts several months. It is vital to redistribute experimental efforts toward more equal data aquisition throughout the experiment to assess the suitability of using BEEHAVE for the prediction of bee colony overwintering survival.

AB Terrestrial organisms such as shoreline spiders that consume prey from aquatic food webs can be contaminated with methylmercury (MeHg). However, no studies have examined the relationship between MeHg contamination of shoreline spider taxa and the proportion of aquatic and terrestrial prey in their diets. The present study had 2 objectives: 1) determine concentrations of MeHg in 7 taxa of shoreline spiders, and 2) assess the relationship between concentrations of MeHg in spiders and the proportion of aquatic and terrestrial prey in spider diets. We collected shoreline spiders, emergent aquatic insects, and terrestrial insects from in and around 10 experimental ponds. Methylmercury concentrations were greatest in spiders, intermediate in aquatic insects, and lowest in terrestrial insects. The elevated MeHg concentrations in spiders indicate that they were feeding, at least in part, on emergent aquatic insects. However, variability in MeHg concentration observed among spider taxa suggested that the proportion of aquatic and terrestrial prey in spider diets likely varied among taxa. We estimated the proportion of aquatic and terrestrial prey in the diet of each spider taxon from the nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) isotope values of spiders and their potential aquatic and terrestrial prey items. The median proportion of aquatic prey in spider diets varied by almost 2-fold, and MeHg concentrations in shoreline spiders were strongly correlated with the proportion of aquatic prey in their diet. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that the degree of connectivity to aquatic food webs determines MeHg contamination of shoreline spiders.

AB An important goal in toxicology is the development of new ways to increase the speed, accuracy, and applicability of chemical hazard and risk assessment approaches. A promising route is the integration of in vitro assays with biological pathway information. We examined how the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework can be used to develop pathway-based quantitative models useful for regulatory chemical safety assessment. By using AOPs as initial conceptual models and the AOP knowledge base as a source of data on key event relationships, different methods can be applied to develop computational quantitative AOP models (qAOPs) relevant for decision making. A qAOP model may not necessarily have the same structure as the AOP it is based on. Useful AOP modeling methods range from statistical, Bayesian networks, regression, and ordinary differential equations to individual-based models and should be chosen according to the questions being asked and the data available. We discuss the need for toxicokinetic models to provide linkages between exposure and qAOPs, to extrapolate from in vitro to in vivo, and to extrapolate across species. Finally, we identify best practices for modeling and model building and the necessity for transparent and comprehensive documentation to gain confidence in the use of qAOP models and ultimately their use in regulatory applications.

AB There are limited data on the sensitivity to contaminants of marine organisms in polar regions. Consequently, assessments of the risk of contaminants to marine biota in polar environments typically include extrapolations from temperate and/or tropical species. This is problematic because the taxonomic composition of organisms differs between polar and temperate/tropical waters, and both the toxicity of chemicals and the physiology of organisms are very different at the stable low temperatures experienced in polar marine systems. Collecting high-quality sensitivity data for a wide range of marine polar organisms using traditional toxicity assessment approaches is a time-consuming and difficult process, especially in remote and hostile environments. We applied a rapid toxicity testing approach, which allowed a much larger number of species to be tested than would be possible with traditional toxicity test methods, albeit with lower replications and fewer exposure concentrations. With this rapid approach, sensitivity estimates are less precise, but more numerous. This is important when constructing species sensitivity distributions (SSDs), which aim to represent the sensitivity of communities. We determined the approximate sensitivity (4- and 10-d median lethal concentration [LC50] values) of a large and representative sample of Antarctic marine invertebrates to copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd). Up to 88 LC50 values (from 88 different taxa) were used in the construction of SSDs. The hazardous concentrations for 1% of taxa (HC1) based on 10-d LC50 values were 37, 346, and 792 mu g/L for Cu, Zn, and Cd, respectively. Our results provide a basis for estimating the risk of exposure to metals for a large representative sample of marine polar invertebrates. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1560-1568. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Disinfection byproducts are formed during most drinking water treatment and presently number >800, some of which are implicated in human health outcomes including bladder cancer and infertility, with unknown mechanisms of action. In particular, it is not yet understood whether these compounds can disrupt the estrogen-signaling pathway through binding to the human estrogen receptor (ER). In the present study, 21 disinfection byproducts, selected for their predicted involvement in endocrine-related diseases and their structural diversity, were individually evaluated for their binding affinity to the human ER and in silico, and then a subset of these chemicals was studied in binary mixtures with the known weak estrogen, 4-n-nonylphenol. Individually, 9 of the 21 disinfection byproducts were able to weakly bind to the ER, with affinities ranging from log median inhibitory concentration values of -3.83 to -2.19 M. In binary mixtures, the chemicals followed concentration addition, with their weak binding affinities having little contribution to the overall mixture affinity. These results demonstrate the variety of small-molecule disinfection byproduct structures that are capable of binding to the ER, and that their weak binding can still be of importance when overall human exposure to mixtures of disinfection byproducts in disinfected drinking water is considered.

AB The need for an integrated risk assessment at an ecologically relevant scale (e.g., at the population/community levels) has been acknowledged. Multispecies systems with increased ecological complexity, however, are difficult if not impossible to reproduce. The laboratory-scale microcosm TriCosm (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Hydra viridissima) of intermediate complexity was developed for the reproducible assessment of chemical effects at the population/community levels. The system dynamics were repeatable in the short term, but interexperimental variation of algal dynamics in the long term triggered knock-on effects on grazer and predator populations. We present 20 experiments to assess the effects of 12 factors (test medium, vessel type/condition, shaking speed, light intensity/regime, inoculation density, medium preparation components, metal concentration/composition, buffering salt type/concentration) on algal growth in the TriCosm enclosure. Growth rates varied between <= 0 and 1.40 (+/- 0.21) and generally were greatest with increased shaking speed, light exposure, medium buffer, or aeration time. Treatments conducted in dishes with aseptically prepared, lightly buffered, and/or hardly aerated medium resulted in low growth rates. We found that inter-experimental variation of algal dynamics in the TriCosm was caused by a modification of medium preparation (omission of medium aeration) with the aim of reducing microbial contamination. Our findings highlight the facts that consistency in experimental procedures and in-depth understanding of system components are indispensable to achieve repeatability.

AB In the present study we performed a microcosm experiment to assess the effects of the insecticide lufenuron on zooplankton communities exposed to increased temperature and drought in (semi-)arid regions. The experiment consisted of 3 environmental scenarios, assessed in 2 parts. Firstly, we assessed how water temperature (20 and 28 degrees C) affects the sensitivity and resilience of the zooplankton community to lufenuron. Secondly, we investigated the influence of drought on the structure of the zooplankton community at a high water temperature (28 degrees C) and evaluated its possible interaction with lufenuron. The results show that the community exposed to lufenuron at 28 degrees C had a faster lufenuron-related response and recovery than the community at 20 degrees C. The combined effects of lufenuron and temperature resulted in a synergistic effect on some taxa (Daphnia sp., Cyclopoida, and Copepoda nauplii). The tested zooplankton community had a high resilience to drought, although some particular taxa were severely affected after desiccation (Calanoida). Interactions between drought and lufenuron were not statistically significant. However, rewetting after desiccation contributed to lufenuron remobilization from sediments and resulted in a slight Cyclopoida population decline at high exposure concentrations. The study shows how environmental conditions related to global change in (semi-)arid regions may influence chemical fate and the vulnerability of zooplankton communities to chemical stress.

AB Unionid mussels are ecologically important and are globally imperiled. Toxicants contribute to mussel declines, and toxicity tests using juvenile mussels-a sensitive life stage-are valuable in determining thresholds used to set water quality criteria. In vitro culture methods provide an efficient way to propagate juveniles for toxicity testing, but their relative chemical sensitivity compared with in vivo propagated juveniles is unknown. Current testing guidelines caution against using in vitro cultured juveniles until this sensitivity is described. Our objective was to evaluate the relative sensitivity of juvenile mussels produced from both in vitro and in vivo propagation methods to selected chemicals. We conducted 96-h acute toxicity tests according to ASTM International guidelines with 3 mussel species and 6 toxicants: chloride, nickel, ammonia, and 3 copper-based compounds. Statistically significant differences between in vitro and in vivo juvenile 96-h median effect concentrations were observed in 8 of 17 tests, and in vitro juveniles were more sensitive in 6 of the 8 significant differences. At 96 h, 4 of the 8 statistically different tests for a given chemical were within a factor of 2, which is the intralaboratory variation demonstrated in a recent evaluation of mussel toxicity tests. We found that although differences in chemical sensitivity exist between in vitro and in vivo propagated juvenile mussels, they are within normal toxicity test variation. Therefore, in vitro propagated juvenile mussels may be appropriate for use in ASTM International-based toxicity testing. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:3077-3085. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB It is commonly assumed that most (>95%) of the mercury (Hg) found in fish muscle is the toxic form, methylmercury (MeHg), due to its efficient assimilation and retention in biotic tissue. However, this assumption is largely based on studies examining the percentage of MeHg (%MeHg [the fraction of total Hg as MeHg]) in muscle from mostly large-bodied predatory fish; less is known about the %MeHg in smaller bodied individuals or those of different trophic guilds. The present study analyzed MeHg and total Hg concentrations in the muscle of 2 large-bodied piscivores (walleye and northern pike), one large-bodied benthivore (white sucker), and 2 small-bodied forage fish (sculpins and shiners) across a broad size range. We found substantially lower %MeHg than the commonly assumed 95% in several fish (e.g., 17 individuals had <70% MeHg). Muscle %MeHg significantly increased with size and age in all species except walleye, which had significantly higher %MeHg than pike or suckers, particularly in smaller and younger fish (e.g., 18-21% higher at 10g; 5-11% higher at 500g). Results of predictive modeling suggest that muscle %MeHg is higher in pelagic-feeding fish and those with lower lipid content, although model results varied significantly among species. According to our findings, total Hg measurement in muscle is not an appropriate proxy for MeHg in smaller fish from all species, an important consideration for future piscine Hg studies and monitoring.

AB We evaluated bioturbation as a facilitator for in situ treatment with a thin layer of activated carbon to treat dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)-contaminated sediment and contaminant influx by sediment deposition. Using the freshwater worm Lumbriculus variegatus as a bioturbator, microcosm time-series studies were conducted for 4 mo and monitored for DDT flux and porewater concentration profiles by polyethylene passive samplers. With bioturbators present, the thin-layer activated carbon amendment reduced DDT flux by >90% compared with the same simulated scenario without activated carbon amendment. In contrast, a clean sediment cap without activated carbon was ineffective in reducing flux when bioturbation was present. In simulated scenarios with contaminant influx through deposition of contaminated sediment, bioturbation facilitated in situ activated carbon treatment, reducing 4-mo DDT flux by 77% compared with the same scenario without bioturbation. Porewater concentration profiles and activated carbon dose profiles confirmed effective mixing of activated carbon particles down to 1-cm depth. A mass transfer model was developed to predict flux with consideration of bioturbation and sediment deposition processes. Predicted flux values were consistent with experimental results and confirm that bioturbation activity helps reduce DDT sediment-to-water fluxes in activated carbon-treated sediment with recontamination by contaminated sediment deposition. To our knowledge, this is the first study to combine experimental and modeling results showing how bioturbation enhances activated carbon amendment effectiveness against ongoing contaminant influx by sediment deposition.

AB In the present study, we examined how sensitivity to oil changes in combination with environmental stressors in Fundulus grandis embryos. We exposed embryos (<24h post fertilization) to a range of high-energy water accommodated fraction (HEWAF) concentrations (0-50 parts per billion [ppb] total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]) made from Macondo crude oil in conjunction with various environmental conditions (temperature: 20 and 30 degrees C; salinity: 3, 7, and 30 practical salinity units [PSU]; and dissolved oxygen: 2 and 6mg/L). Endpoints included mortality, hatching rates, and expression of cytochrome p450 1a and 1c (cyp1a, cyp1c) in hatched larvae. There was 100% mortality for all fish under the 2 parts per million (ppm) dissolved oxygen regimes. For the 6mg/L dissolved oxygen treatments, mortality and median lethal time (LT50) were generally higher in the 30 degrees C treatments versus the 20 degrees C treatments. Oil increased mortality in fish exposed to the highest concentration in the 20-3-6 (degrees C-PSU-mg/L), 25-7-6, and 30-30-6 conditions. Hatching was driven by environmental conditions, with oil exposure having a significant impact on hatching in only the 25-7-6 and 30-30-6 groups at the greatest HEWAF exposure. Expression of cyp1a was up-regulated in most treatment groups versus the controls, with cyp1c expression exhibiting a similar pattern. These data suggest interactive effects among temperature, salinity, and PAHs, highlighting a need to further assess the effects of oil exposure under various environmental conditions.

AB To evaluate the effect of fish growth on mercury (Hg) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) bioaccumulation, a non-steady-state toxicokinetic model, combined with a Wisconsin bioenergetics model, was developed to simulate Hg and PCB bioaccumulation in bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). The model was validated by comparing observed with predicted Hg and PCB 180 concentrations across 5 age classes from 5 different waterbodies across North America. The non-steady-state model generated accurate predictions for Hg and PCB bioaccumulation in 3 of 5 waterbodies: Apsey Lake (ON, Canada), Sharbot Lake (ON, Canada), and Stonelick Lake (OH, USA). The poor performance of the model for the Detroit River (MI, USA/ON, Canada) and Lake Hartwell (GA/SC, USA), which are 2 well-known contaminated sites with possibly high heterogeneity in spatial contamination, was attributed to changes in feeding behavior and/or prey contamination. Model simulations indicate that growth dilution is a major component of contaminant bioaccumulation patterns in fish, especially during early life stages, and was predicted to be more important for hydrophobic PCBs than for Hg. Simulations that considered tissue-specific growth provided some improvement in model performance particularly for PCBs in fish populations that exhibited changes in their whole-body lipid content with age. Higher variation in lipid growth compared with that of lean dry protein was also observed between different bluegill populations, which partially explains the greater variation in PCB bioaccumulation slopes compared with Hg across sampling sites.

AB Histopathology index systems involve the application of weighted scores to various diagnostic findings for the purpose of calculating overall organ and/or whole-animal health measurements. Such systems were originally developed as tools for monitoring the general health of fish populations. More recently, index systems have been applied to hypothesis-based toxicological studies, the goal of which is to investigate whether a cause-and-effect relationship exists between exposure to a particular test substance or environmental contaminant and morphologic effects in fish tissues. However, the application of index systems in that context is problematic for various reasons: a dependency on untested assumptions of toxicological importance for different types of histopathologic findings; organ scores that combine mechanistically unrelated and potentially contradictory diagnoses; calculations that include excessive numbers of findings, some of which may be incidental to the study outcome; failure to incorporate additional relevant results into the data interpretation, such as clinical observations, macroscopic findings, organ/body weights, clinical pathology data, and the results of hormonal or other biochemical assays; the inappropriate mathematical manipulation of ordinal categorical data (e.g., severity scores and importance factors); and a tendency of these systems to amplify, mask, and divert attention from methodological weaknesses and inaccurate diagnoses. The purpose of the present article is to demonstrate why the use of index systems is a misguided approach for handling histopathology data in studies of potential fish toxicants.

AB The present study investigated oil dispersant toxicity to fish species typical of the cooler regions of Canada, together with less well-documented issues pertaining to oil dispersant monitoring. The oil dispersant toxicity of Corexit EC9500A was assessed for the freshwater fish species rainbow trout and the seawater species coho, chinook, and chum, with a final median lethal concentration (LC50) acute lethality range between 35.3 and 59.8mg/L. The LC50 range was calculated using confirmed 0-h dispersant concentrations that were justified by fish mortality within the first 24h of exposure and by variability of the dispersant indicator dioctyl sulfosuccinate (DOSS) used to monitor concentrations at later time points. To investigate DOSS as an oil dispersant indicator in the environment, microcosm systems were prepared containing Corexit EC9500A, Finasol OSR52, Slickgone NS, and Slickgone EW dispersants together with diluted bitumen. The DOSS indicator recovery was found to be stable for up to 13 d at 5 degrees C, 8 d at 10 degrees C, but significantly less than 8 d at 15 degrees C. After 3 d at temperatures 15 degrees C, the DOSS indicator recovery became less accurate and was dependent on multiple environmental factors including temperature, microbial activity, and aeration, with potential for loss of solvents and stabilizers. A final assessment determined DOSS to be a discrepant indicator for long-term monitoring of oil dispersant in seawater. (C) 2018 SETAC

AB Bifenthrin is a pyrethroid insecticide used in urban and agricultural applications. Previous studies have shown that environmentally relevant (ng/L) concentrations of bifenthrin increased plasma concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and altered the expression of dopaminergic pathway components. The dopaminergic neurons can indirectly regulate E2 biosynthesis, suggesting that bifenthrin may disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Because embryos do not have a complete HPG axis, the hypothesis that bifenthrin impairs dopamine regulation was tested in embryonic and 1-mo-old juvenile zebrafish (Danio rerio) with exposure to measured concentrations of 0.34 and 3.1mg/L bifenthrin for 96 h. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate transcripts of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine receptor 1 (DR1) and 2A (DR2A), dopamine active transporter (DAT), estrogen receptor a (ER alpha), ER beta 1, ER beta 2, luteinizing hormone beta (LH beta), follicle-stimulating hormone beta (FSH beta), vitellogenin (VTG), cytochrome P450 cyp19a1a, and cyp19a1b. Levels of E2 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Dopamine and its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) concentrations were measured by liquid chromatrography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Significant decreases in TH and DR1 transcripts and HVA levels, as well as ratios of HVA/dopamine and HVA+DOPAC/dopamine, in zebrafish embryos were observed after bifenthrin treatment. In juveniles, a significant increase in the expression of ER beta 1 and the DOPAC to dopamine ratio was noted. These results show a possible antiestrogenic effect of bifenthrin in embryos, and estrogenicity in juveniles, indicating life-stage-dependent toxicity in developing fish. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Aluminum (Al) toxicity to aquatic organisms is strongly affected by water chemistry. Toxicity-modifying factors such as pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), hardness, and temperature have a large impact on the bioavailability and toxicity of Al to aquatic organisms. The importance of water chemistry on the bioavailability and toxicity of Al suggests that interactions between Al and chemical constituents in exposures to aquatic organisms can affect the form and reactivity of Al, thereby altering the extent to which it interacts with biological membranes. These types of interactions have previously been observed in the toxicity data for other metals, which have been well described by the biotic ligand model (BLM) framework. In BLM applications to other metals (including cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, nickel, silver, and zinc), these interactions have focused on dissolved metal. A review of Al toxicity data shows that concentrations of Al that cause toxicity are frequently in excess of solubility limitations. Aluminum solubility is strongly pH dependent, with a solubility minimum near pH 6 and increasing at both lower and higher pH values. For the Al BLM, the mechanistic framework has been extended to consider toxicity resulting from a combination of dissolved and precipitated Al to recognize the solubility limitation. The resulting model can effectively predict toxicity to fish, invertebrates, and algae over a wide range of conditions. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Some current-use pesticides are chiral and have nonsuperimposable mirror images called enantiomers that exhibit identical physical-chemical properties but can behave differently when in contact with other chiral molecules (e.g., regarding degradation and uptake). These differences can result in variations in enantiomer presence in the environment and potentially change the toxicity of pesticide residues. Several current-use chiral pesticides are applied in urban and agricultural areas, with increased potential to enter watersheds and adversely affect aquatic organisms. The present study describes a stereoselective analytical method for the current-use pesticides fipronil, cis-bifenthrin, cis-permethrin, cypermethrin, and cyfluthrin. We show use of the method by characterizing enantiomer fractions in environmental sample extracts (sediment and water), and laboratory dosed fish and concrete extracts previously collected by California organizations. Enantiomer fractions for most environmental samples are the same as racemic standards (equal amounts of enantiomers, enantiomer fraction = 0.5) and therefore are not expected to differ in toxicity from racemic mixtures typically tested. In laboratory-derived samples, enantiomer fractions are more frequently nonracemic and favor the less toxic enantiomer; permethrin enantiomer fractions range from 0.094 to 0.391 in one type of concrete runoff and enantiomer fractions of bifenthrin in dosed fish range from 0.378 to 0.499. We use enantiomer fractions as a screening tool to understand environmental exposure and explore ways this uncommon measurement could be used to better understand toxicity and risk.

AB Sponges are a potential alternative model species to bivalves in pollution biomonitoring and environmental risk assessment in the aquatic ecosystem. In the present study, a novel in vivo exposure sponge culture model was developed from field-collected and cryopreserved sponge (Hymeniacidon perleve) cells to investigate the genotoxic effects of environmentally relevant metals in the laboratory. Sponge cell aggregates were cultured and exposed to noncytotoxic concentrations (0-0.4mg/L) of cadmium chloride, nickel chloride, and sodium dichromate as quantified by the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and DNA-strand breaks assessed by the comet assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation was quantified by oxidation of 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate in sponge cell aggregates exposed to the same concentrations of Cd, Cr, and Ni. There was a statistically significant (p<0.05) concentration-dependent increase in the level of DNA-strand breaks and ROS formation in all of the metals investigated. To the best of our knowledge, we have utilized for the first time the alkaline comet assay to detect DNA-strand breaks in marine sponge cells and demonstrated that exposure to noncytotoxic concentrations of Cd, Cr, and Ni for 12h results in a concentration-dependent increase in DNA damage and levels of ROS production. In conclusion, we have developed a novel in vivo model based on culture of cryopreserved sponge cells that is compatible with the alkaline comet assay. Genotoxicity in marine sponges measured by the comet assay technique may be a useful tool for biomonitoring research and risk assessment in aquatic ecosystems. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3314-3323.

AB The bio-nano interface is the boundary where engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) meet the biological system, exerting the biological function for which they have been designed or inducing adverse effects on other cells or organisms when they reach nontarget scenarios (i.e., the natural environment). Research has been performed to determine the fate, transport, and toxic properties of ENMs, but much of it is focused on pristine or so-called as-manufactured ENMs, or else modifications of the materials were not assessed. We review the most recent progress regarding the bio-nano interface and the transformations that ENMs undergo in the environment, paying special attention to the adsorption of environmental biomolecules on the surface of ENMs. Whereas the protein corona has received considerable attention in the fields of biomedics and human toxicology, its environmental analogue (the eco-corona) has been much less studied. A section dedicated to the analytical methods for studying and characterizing the eco-corona is also presented. We conclude by presenting and discussing the key problems and knowledge gaps that need to be resolved in the near future regarding the bio-nano interface and the eco-corona.

AB With the aim to refine water analysis in fish bioconcentration studies, automated solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was used as an alternative approach to conventional solvent extraction (liquid-liquid extraction [LLE]) for the extraction of 3 hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs; log K-OW 5.5-7.8) from flow-through studies with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The results showed that total concentrations extracted by SPME combined with internal standards and LLE are equal. The results further verify the possibility of simultaneous extraction of total and freely dissolved HOC concentrations by SPME. Freely dissolved concentrations allow the assessment of sorption and bioavailability of HOCs in bioconcentration studies and their potential impact on resulting bioconcentration factors (BCFs). Reduction in freely dissolved water concentrations can result in an underestimation of BCFs if they are calculated based on total water concentrations. For polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 153, a significant increase in BCF value was observed when freely dissolved concentrations were taken into account. However, log BCF values calculated based on freely dissolved concentrations did not correlate linearly with log K-OW values above 5 to 6. This pointed to further influences besides a reduction in freely dissolved water concentrations by sorption to organic matter. The results can aid in assessment of the factors that influence bioconcentration systems and also give important information regarding the possible replacement of LLE by SPME for water analysis of highly HOCs in fish bioconcentration studies.

AB The US Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) ambient water quality criteria (AWQC) for lead (Pb) in salt water were developed in 1984. The acute and chronic criteria are 210 and 8.1g/L dissolved Pb, respectively. Because data were limited in 1984, the chronic criterion was derived using an acute-to-chronic ratio, but there are now sufficient toxicity data such that an acute-to-chronic ratio is no longer needed. Based on the data now available, the proposed updated acute and chronic salt water Pb AWQC (following USEPA methods) are 100 and 10 mu g/L, respectively. In the European Union, a chronic salt water predicted no-effect concentration based on the median 5th percentile hazardous concentration (HC5-50) was developed in 2008 for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals program, which forms the basis for deriving chronic environmental quality standards for Pb in European marine waters. The salt water HC5-50 previously derived for Pb was 6.1g/L, whereas the proposed, updated chronic salt water HC5-50 derived following European Union methods is 11.0 mu g/L. Thus, despite differences in derivation methodologies, the proposed AWQC and HC5-50 values are very consistent. Studies evaluating the effect of water quality factors on bioavailability and toxicity of Pb in salt water are limited; the effect of water quality on Pb toxicity in salt water should be considered in future studies.

AB Crude oils contain a mixture of hydrocarbons, including phototoxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that have the ability to absorb ultraviolet (UV) light. Absorption of UV light by PAHs can substantially increase their toxicity to marine organisms. The objective of the present study was to examine the potential for phototoxicity of fresh and naturally weathered Macondo crude oils alone and in combination with the dispersant Corexit 9500 to mysid shrimp (Americamysis bahia), inland silverside (Menidia beryllina), sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus), and Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis). Acute toxicity tests were conducted using combinations of natural or artificial sunlight and low-energy water-accommodated fractions (WAFs) of fresh and weathered Macondo crude oils collected from the Gulf of Mexico. Studies were also conducted to compare the phototoxicity resulting from natural and artificial sunlight. Fresh Macondo crude oil was more phototoxic than weathered crude oils, both in the presence and in the absence of UV light. Differences in toxicity between fresh and weathered crude oils were likely attributed to lighter-ringed PAHs in fresh crude oils. Phototoxic PAHs were relatively resistant to weathering compared with lighter-ringed PAHs. The addition of Corexit 9500 to crude oil increased toxicity compared with tests with crude oil alone, by increasing phototoxic PAH concentrations in WAFs. Macondo crude oils had the potential to be phototoxic to Gulf of Mexico marine organisms if specific light conditions and PAH concentrations were present during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

AB The behavior and fate of pharmaceutical ingredients in coastal marine ecosystems are not well understood. To address this, the spatial and temporal distribution of 15 high-volume pharmaceuticals were measured over a 1-yr period in Narragansett Bay (RI, USA) to elucidate factors and processes regulating their concentration and distribution. Dissolved concentrations ranged from below detection to 313 ng/L, with 4 pharmaceuticals present at all sites and sampling periods. Eight pharmaceuticals were present in suspended particulate material, ranging in concentration from below detection to 44 ng/g. Partitioning coefficients were determined for some pharmaceuticals, with their range and variability remaining relatively constant throughout the study. Normalization to organic carbon content provided no benefit, indicating other factors played a greater role in regulating partitioning behavior. Within the upper bay, the continuous influx of wastewater treatment plant effluents resulted in sustained, elevated levels of pharmaceuticals. A pharmaceutical concentration gradient was apparent from this zone to the mouth of the bay. For most of the pharmaceuticals, there was a strong relationship with salinity, indicating conservative behavior within the estuary. Short flushing times in Narragansett Bay coupled with pharmaceuticals' presence overwhelmingly in the dissolved phase indicate that most pharmaceuticals will be diluted and transported out of the estuary, with only trace amounts of several compounds sequestered in sediments. The present study identifies factors controlling the temporal and spatial dynamics of dissolved and particulate pharmaceuticals; their partitioning behavior provides an increased understanding of their fate, including bioavailability in an urban estuary.

AB In the scientific field of physiologically based toxicokinetic modeling the complexity of the model used depends on the complexity of the problem to be handled, leading to a broad range of existing models from simple 1-box models to complex multicompartment models. Most of these models work with lumped parameters, for example, an uptake efficiency parameter that can only be obtained with a fit of experimental data. The authors' goal was a model that is completely based on well-defined physiological and physicochemical parameters. Lumped parameters fitted on training data sets would limit the model's applicability. This would enable a new view on process understanding for uptake, distribution, and elimination procedures. Eventual goals are a better localization of chemicals within the organism itself, and to set the stage for future extensions toward ionic compounds and active transport across membranes. The model evaluation reported in the present study has shown that uptake, clearance, and bioaccumulation data for nonpolar chemicals are well predicted. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The authors examined the potential of pulp mill effluent from pulp-producing countries (Canada, Brazil, New Zealand) to affect fish reproduction. Specifically, the estrogenic effects in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) pulse-exposed to 11 different mill effluent extracts (intraperitoneal injections of solid-phase extraction-dichloromethane nonpolar fraction). The results indicated that effluent extracts were estrogenic in juvenile trout irrespective of the gender, as reflected by increasing level of plasma vitellogenin (VTG; Brazil > New Zealand > Canada). Despite the high variability observed among mills, differences in VTG levels were related to the type of mill process (kraft> elementary chlorine-free kraft> thermomechanical pulping). Moreover, effluent treatments did not appear to significantly decrease VTG induction. A consistent estrogenic effect was observed in those mills that process a combination of feedstocks (softwood and hardwood), with the highest increase in VTG related to eucalyptus feedstock. The results demonstrate significant estrogenic effects of pulp mill effluents on chronically exposed juvenile trout, suggesting that in vivo metabolic activation of precursors is necessary to cause the observed increases in VTG levels. This molecular estrogenic response provides a useful starting point for predicting population-level impacts through the adverse outcome pathway methodology. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The complex chemistry of iron (Fe) at circumneutral pH in oxygenated waters and the poor correlation between ecotoxicity results in laboratory and natural waters have led to regulatory approaches for iron based on field studies (US Environmental Protection Agency Water Quality Criteria and European Union Water Framework Directive proposal for Fe). The results of the present study account for the observed differences between laboratory and field observations for Fe toxicity to algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata). Results from standard 72-h assays with Fe at pH 6.3 and pH 8 resulted in similar toxicity values measured as algal biomass, with 50% effect concentrations (EC50) of 3.28 mg/L and 4.95 mg/L total Fe(III), respectively. At the end of the 72-h exposure, however, dissolved Fe concentrations were lower than 30 mg/L for all test concentrations, making a direct toxic effect of dissolved iron on algae unlikely. Analysis of nutrient concentrations in the artificial test media detected phosphorus depletion in a dose-dependent manner that correlated well with algal toxicity. Subsequent experiments adding excess phosphorus after Fe precipitation eliminated the toxicity. These results strongly suggest that observed Fe(III) toxicity on algae in laboratory conditions is a secondary effect of phosphorous depletion. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The authors compared procedures for digestion of mussel soft tissues and extraction of microplastics. Complete tissue digestion was achieved with 1M NaOH, 35% HNO3, and protease at 9.6 UHb/mL (unit hemoglobin per mL); but use of HNO3 caused unacceptable destruction of some microplastics. Recovery of microplastics spiked into mussels was similar (93 +/- 10%) for NaOH and enzyme digestions. The authors recommend use of industrial enzymes based on digestion efficiency, microplastic recovery, and avoidance of caustic chemicals. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The presence of kaolinite, montmorillonite, and illite in packed quartz sand inhibited the transport of graphene oxide to different degrees. Transport inhibition was exerted mainly by the presence of positively charged sites on clay edges ( which served as favorable deposition sites), whereas the effects on the overall particle-collector interaction energy and flow path were small. Kaolinite exhibited the most significant transport-inhibition effects because of its high percentage of edge area. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The metabolites 17 alpha-trenbolone and 17 alpha-estradiol are principal metabolites in cattle excreta following the administration of Synovex (R) ONE, which contains trenbolone acetate and estradiol benzoate. As part of the environmental assessment of the use of Synovex ONE, data were generated to characterize the fate of 17 alpha-trenbolone, and its metabolite trendione in the environment. Predictions of the fate and environmental concentrations of these hormones after land application require accurate estimates of the sorption of these compounds in soils. The sorption and desorption of 17 alpha-trenbolone and trendione were measured at 5 nominal concentrations in 5 soils from different geologic settings using a batch equilibrium technique following guideline 106 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Both the sorption and desorption of 17 alpha-trenbolone and trendione to soils were adequately described by the Freundlich sorption model and by linear partition coefficients. The mean sorption coefficients were 9.04 mL/g and 32.2 mL/g for 17 alpha-trenbolone and trendione, respectively. The corresponding mean Freundlich sorption exponents were 0.88 and 0.98, respectively. Sorption of 17 alpha-trenbolone and trendione was correlated principally with soil organic carbon. Average sorption coefficients normalized to soil organic carbon content (K-OC) were 460 mL/g and 1804 mL/g for 17 alpha-trenbolone and trendione, respectively. The mean desorption coefficients were 22.1 mL/g and 43.8 mL/g for 17 alpha-trenbolone and trendione, respectively. Calculated hysteresis coefficients based on the difference in the area between sorption and desorption isotherms indicated that sorption equilibrium was not fully reversible and hysteresis of desorption isotherms occurred for both 17 alpha-trenbolone and trendione.

AB Previous research evaluating hydrocarbon toxicity to corals and coral reefs has generally focused on community-level effects, and results often are not comparable between studies because of variability in hydrocarbon exposure characterization and evaluation of coral health and mortality during exposure. Toxicity of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 1-methylnaphthalene to the coral Porites divaricata was assessed in a constant exposure toxicity test utilizing a novel toxicity testing protocol uniquely applicable to shallow-water corals, which considered multiple assessment metrics and evaluated the potential for post-exposure mortality and/or recovery. Acute and subacute effects (gross morphological changes, photosynthetic efficiency, mortality, and histologic cellular changes) were evaluated during pre-exposure (4wk), exposure (48h), and post-exposure recovery (4wk) periods. Coral condition scores were used to determine a 48-h median effective concentration of 7442g/L. Significant physical and histological changes resulted from exposure to 640g/L and 5427g/L 1-methylnaphthalene, with a 1-d to 3-d delay in photosynthetic efficiency effects (F/Fm). Pigmented granular amoebocyte area was found to be a potentially useful sublethal endpoint for this species. Coral mortality was used to estimate a 48-h median lethal concentration of 12123g/L.

AB Large-scale releases of environmental contaminants from industrial facilities can cause considerable damage to surrounding ecosystems and require remediation. The expense and/or undesirable environmental side effects of physical removal may constrain remediation efforts. In 2008, approximately 4.1 million m(3) of fly ash were released into the Emory River at a coal-burning power plant in Kingston, Tennessee, USA. Approximately 390000m(3) of fly ash were not removed (hereafter residual ash), to avoid disturbing underlying legacy contamination from unrelated historical industrial activity. In 2011 and 2012, the authors measured trace element concentrations in an assemblage of freshwater turtles in 2 rivers impacted by the spill and in a third river that was unaffected. Concentrations of arsenic, copper, iron, mercury, manganese, selenium, and zinc were higher in turtles from rivers affected by the spill but low relative to concentrations known to be toxic to other vertebrates. Concentrations of some trace elements decreased with distance from the original spill site but were not strongly affected by nearby volumes of residual ash. Among-species differences in trace element bioaccumulation and/or the relatively low spatial resolution of available data on residual ash volumes may have obscured this effect. The results suggest that the spill influenced turtle bioaccumulation of trace elements but that distance from the spill site may be a more important factor than residual ash in influencing postremediation bioaccumulation.

AB Agriculture within the Great Barrier Reef catchment area has contributed to pesticide contamination of adjacent freshwater ecosystems that flow into the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. A novel multispecies toxicity test was used to assess the toxicity of diuron and hexazinone, 2 herbicides commonly detected within the Great Barrier Reef catchment area, to a community of 3 tropical freshwater microalgae: Monoraphidium arcuatum, Nannochloropsis-like sp., and Pediastrum duplex. Diuron was the most toxic herbicide, with 10% inhibition concentration (IC10) values of 4.3, 7.1, and 29 mu g/L for P. duplex, M. arcuatum, and Nannochloropsis-like sp., respectively, followed by hexazinone, with IC10 values of 15, 18, and 450 mu g/L, respectively Toxicity testing on 2 commercial formulations (Barrage, 13.2% hexazinone and 48.6% diuron; Diurex, 90% diuron) showed that additives in the commercial formulations did not significantly increase the toxicity of diuron. Direct toxicity assessments were carried out on water samples from the herbicide-contaminated Sandy Creek, which discharges to the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, and a clean reference site, Tully Gorge in the Tully River. Toxicity was observed in several Sandy Creek samples. Artificial herbicide mixtures were assessed in synthetic soft water and natural freshwaters, with toxic responses being observed at environmentally relevant concentrations. The present study successfully applied a novel multispecies tropical microalgal toxicity test, indicating that it is an effective tool for the assessment of herbicide toxicity in both natural and synthetic freshwaters.

AB When birds are exposed to oil, their ability to thermoregulate is impaired as a result of damage to the insulative properties of their feathers. If an oiled bird is unable to maintain thermal homeostasis, hypothermia and death can follow rapidly. Physiological responses to oiling depend on several variables including environmental conditions (e.g., ambient air and water temperatures), life history of bird species (e.g., body size and habitat selection), and foraging strategies (e.g., divers, surface feeders, shorebirds). The most widely used approach to assess the effect of spilled oil on birds is the US Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) Type A Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) Model for Coastal and Marine Environments. This approach addresses body size and time spent in a hypothetical slick but lacks the flexibility to assess other variables related to physiological response. We developed a dynamic physiologically based oiling model (PBOM) for birds to address this need. The PBOM has been validated against empirical data from a dose-response study in which common eiders were exposed to Statfjord A crude oil. The PBOM can be used to predict time to hypothermia for birds of differing body size and habitat preferences, in environments ranging from Arctic to subtropical. The model presently includes 5 representative bird species: common eider, spotted sandpiper, great blue heron, dovekie, and American white pelican, but could be adapted to represent almost any bird.

AB Dufulin is a new type of chiral antiplant virus agent independently developed in China. The present study was conducted to determine the effects of different concentrations ofrac-dufulin and dufulin enantiomers (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) on oxidative stress inTubifexafter exposure for 3, 7, and 14 d. Results showed thatrac-dufulin and individual enantiomers had no significant effects on total protein content and glutathione reductase activities. Increased superoxide dismutase demonstrated the generation of superoxide anion radical. The increase in glutathioneS-transferase may be due to detoxification mechanisms. The different changes in catalase activities could be due to oxidative stress. The increase in malondialdehyde may be due to the accumulation and toxicity of contaminations. The degradation behavior of dufulin enantiomers was studied through spiked-water and spiked-soil tests. The degradation rate ofS-(+)-dufulin was faster than that ofR-(-)-dufulin. The present study demonstrated the occurrence of enantioselectivity in the degradation and oxidative stress of dufulin toTubifex. In spiked soil, the concentrations of dufulin enantiomers in underlying soil were significantly higher than those in overlying water; but after 5 d of degradation, the bioturbation ofTubifexcould facilitate part of dufulin diffusing from the underlying soil into the overlying water and altered the partitioning of dufulin. The present study provided a basis for conducting environmental safety risk assessments and rationally using dufulin as a chiral pesticide.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-11. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Substances of unknown or variable composition, complex reaction products, or biological materials (UVCBs) pose unique risk assessment challenges to regulators and to product registrants. These substances can contain many constituents, sometimes partially unknown and/or variable, depending on fluctuations in their source material and/or manufacturing process. International regulatory agencies have highlighted the difficulties in characterizing UVCBs and assessing their toxicity and environmental fate. Several industrial sectors have attempted to address these issues by developing frameworks and characterization methods. Based on the output of a 2016 workshop, this critical review examines current practices for UVCB risk assessment and reveals a need for a multipronged and transparent approach integrating whole-substance and constituent-based information. In silico tools or empirical measurements can provide information on discrete and/or blocks of UVCB constituents with similar hazard properties. Read-across and/or whole-substance toxicity and fate testing using adapted emerging methods can provide whole-substance information. Continued collaboration of stakeholders representing government, industry, and academia will facilitate the development of practical testing strategies and guidelines for addressing regulatory requirements for UVCBs.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-12.

AB Saflufenacil when applied to a field is susceptible to transport, degradation, and transformation. We used a laboratory-based approach to model the fate of saflufenacil in the environment, the results of which are compared directly with those observed in a field study where saflufenacil was applied to a crop of winter wheat at a standard rate of 63 g of active ingredient/hectare. The water solubility of 2.1 g/L for saflufenacil allows for vertical transport through soil at a rate of 4.3 cm/mL of rainwater, and a soil adsorption coefficientK(OC)of 28.8 suggests that some of the herbicide will absorb to the soil. Of the saflufenacil in the soil, 78 +/- 2.1% (n = 18) partitioned into plants, including nontargeted crop species, where it was found primarily in leaves (78 +/- 2.1%,n = 18) and roots (22 +/- 1.7%,n = 18). The saflufenacil that does not partition into plants or undergo vertical transport followed a degradation pathway into 3 metabolites: a uracil-ring N-demethylated metabolite (Saf-mu CH3), a doubly N-demethylated metabolite (Saf-2CH(3)), and a ring-cleavage metabolite (Saf-RC), identified using nontargeted mass spectrometry. In the field, saflufenacil was observed to degrade over 212 d to the persistent metabolite Saf-RC. This metabolite was found at a concentration that was 1/10th of that applied to the field, suggesting that the majority of saflufenacil had undergone transport through the soil, or uptake into the winter wheat crop. Field samples were further examined using F-19 nuclear magnetic resonance and nontargeted mass spectrometry to rule out the potential of other degradation products.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-11.

AB A study was conducted to understand the potential for ibuprofen to impact the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal endocrine axis resulting in disruption of fish reproduction. The Good Laboratory Practice study was conducted according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 229 Protocol, Fish Short-Term Reproduction Assay, and extended an additional 4 d to evaluate hatching success in the F1 generation. Test organisms were exposed to nominal test concentrations of 0.5, 2.4, 11.5, 55.3, and 265.4 mu g ibuprofen/L and a negative control (dilution water). To strengthen the statistical power of the study, twice the number of replicates were used in the negative control versus individual treatment levels. A 21-d pre-exposure to identify groups of actively spawning fish was immediately followed by a 36-d exposure. Results for apical endpoints of survival, growth, and reproduction (fecundity and fertility), as well as the biomarker vitellogenin in the F0 generation and time to hatch and hatching success in the F1 generation are presented. Based on mean measured exposure concentrations and effects on fecundity in the F0 generation and hatching success in the F1 generation, overall no-observed-effect concentration and lowest-observed-effect concentration for the present study were 55.2 and 265.9 mu g ibuprofen/L, respectively. Results from the present study indicate a lack of endocrine-mediated reproductive effects in zebrafish at environmentally relevant concentrations of ibuprofen.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-12.

AB Perfluoro alkyl acids (PFAAs) are known to bioconcentrate in plants grown in contaminated soils; the potential risk from consuming these plants is currently less understood. We determined that the current daily reference doses (RfDs) of the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) could be met by consuming a single radish grown in soils with a perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) concentration of 9.7 ng/g or a perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) concentration of 90.5 ng/g. Using a combination of our own research and literature data on plant uptake of PFAAs from soil, we developed equations for predicting PFAA bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for plant shoot and root tissues grown in soils with a known percentage of organic carbon. This calculated BCF was then applied to 6 scenarios with measured soil PFAA concentrations to estimate PFAA concentrations in plants and potential exposure to humans and animals consuming harvested vegetation. Five of the 6 scenarios showed potential for surpassing USEPA PFAA RfDs at soil concentrations as low as 24 ng/g PFOA and 28 ng/g PFOS.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-14. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Establishment and maintenance of milkweed plants (Asclepias spp.) in agricultural landscapes of the north central United States are needed to reverse the decline of North America's eastern monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) population. Because of a lack of toxicity data, it is unclear how insecticide use may reduce monarch productivity when milkweed habitat is placed near maize and soybean fields. To assess the potential effects of foliar insecticides, acute cuticular and dietary toxicity of 5 representative active ingredients were determined: beta-cyfluthrin (pyrethroid), chlorantraniliprole (anthranilic diamide), chlorpyrifos (organophosphate), and imidacloprid and thiamethoxam (neonicotinoids). Cuticular median lethal dose values for first instars ranged from 9.2 x 10(-3) to 79 mu g/g larvae for beta-cyfluthrin and chlorpyrifos, respectively. Dietary median lethal concentration values for second instars ranged from 8.3 x 10(-3) to 8.4 mu g/g milkweed leaf for chlorantraniliprole and chlorpyrifos, respectively. To estimate larval mortality rates downwind from treated fields, modeled insecticide exposures to larvae and milkweed leaves were compared to dose-response curves obtained from bioassays with first-, second-, third-, and fifth-instar larvae. For aerial applications to manage soybean aphids, mortality rates at 60 m downwind were highest for beta-cyfluthrin and chlorantraniliprole following cuticular and dietary exposure, respectively, and lowest for thiamethoxam. To estimate landscape-scale risks, field-scale mortality rates must be considered in the context of spatial and temporal patterns of insecticide use. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;39:923-941.

AB Chlorination is commonly used to control biofouling organisms, but chlorine rapidly hydrolyzes in seawater to hypochlorite, which undergoes further reaction with bromide, and then with organic matter. These reaction products, collectively termed chlorine-produced oxidants (CPOs), can be toxic to marine biota. Because the lifetime of the most toxic forms is limited to several days, appropriate guideline values need to be based on short-term (acute) toxicity tests, rather than chronic tests. Flow-through toxicity tests that provide continuous CPO exposure are the most appropriate, whereas static-renewal tests generate variable exposure and effects depending on the renewal rate. There are literature data for acute CPO toxicity from flow-through tests, together with values from 2 sensitive 15-min static tests on 30 species from 9 taxonomic groups. These values were used in a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) to derive guideline values that were protective of 99, 95, and 90% of species at 2.2, 7.2, and 13 mu g CPO/L respectively. These are the first marine guideline values for chlorine to be derived using SSDs, with all other international guideline values based on the use of assessment factors applied to data for the most sensitive species. In applying these conservative guideline values in field situations, it would need to be demonstrated that concentrations of CPOs would be reduced to below the guideline value within an acceptable mixing zone through both dilution and dissociation.

AB Low-headspace oxygen was used in the hydroponic design to evaluate the toxicity of sulfide to wild rice (Zizania palustris). Oxygen levels in the headspace gas phase were maintained at <0.005 atm. The results indicated that mesocotyl emergence was the most sensitive endpoint (>= 3.1 mg/L sulfide and 0.8 mg/L iron [Fe]). At 2.8 mg Fe/L, >= 7.8 mg/L sulfide was required to reduce emergence, shoot weight, and shoot length. Overall, the results were similar to those of previous studies in which atmospheric oxygen was maintained in the headspace gas phase, demonstrating that the oxygen level in the headspace gas phase during mesocotyl emergence and early growth was not a significant factor in sulfide tolerance.

AB Environmental quality guideline values and remediation targets, specific to Antarctic ecosystems, are required for the risk assessment and remediation of contaminated sites in Antarctica. Ecotoxicological testing with Antarctic soil organisms is fundamental in determining reliable contaminant effect threshold concentrations. The present study describes the development of optimal culturing techniques and aqueous toxicity test procedures for an endemic Antarctic soil nematode, Plectus murrayi, which lives within interstitial waters between soil particles. Toxicity tests were of extended duration to account for the species' physiology and life-history characteristics. Plectus murrayi was sensitive to aqueous copper with a 50% effective concentration for egg-hatching success of 139 mu g/L. Hatched juveniles that were first exposed to copper as eggs appeared to be less sensitive than those first exposed at the hatched J2 stage, indicating a potential protective effect of the egg. Sensitivity of juveniles to copper increased with exposure duration, with 50% lethal concentrations of 478 and 117 mu g/L at 21 and 28 d, respectively. The present study describes new methods for the application of an environmentally relevant test species to the risk assessment of contaminants in Antarctic soil and provides the first estimates of sensitivity to a toxicant for an Antarctic terrestrial microinvertebrate.

AB Effect-based monitoring is increasingly applied to detect and-in conjunction with chemical analysis-to identify endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the environment. Although this approach of effect-directed analysis has been successfully demonstrated for estrogenicity and androgenicity, data on progestogens and glucocorticoids driving endocrine disruption are quite limited. We investigated progestogenic and glucocorticoid activities in Danube River water receiving untreated wastewater from Novi Sad, Serbia. After a 2-step fractionation, all fractions were tested with reporter gene bioassays for agonistic and antagonistic hormonal responses at progestogenic and glucocorticoid hormone receptors as well as with target and nontarget analytical screening of active fractions by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. Due to masking by cytotoxic mixture components, the effects could not be detected in the raw water extract but were unraveled only after fractionation. Target chemical screening of the fraction that was active in the progesterone receptor (PR) assay revealed that progesterone and megestrol acetate were predominant drivers of PR-mediated activity along with medroxyprogesterone, dihydrotestosterone, androsterone, and epiandrosterone. Hydrocortisone was detected at sub-ng/L concentration in the active fraction in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) assay but could not explain a significant fraction of the observed GR activity. The present study indicates that effect-based monitoring is a powerful tool to detect EDCs in the aquatic environment but that fractionation may be required to avoid masking effects of mixture components. Future effect-directed analysis studies are required to better understand the occurrence of EDCs and masking compounds in different lipophilicity windows, to finally reduce fractionation requirements for monitoring to a smart clean-up.

AB Exposure to dioxin-like compounds is consistently associated with concentration-dependent induction of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) enzymes in primary cultures of avian hepatocytes. We have previously demonstrated that the median effective concentration (EC50) for induction of this response is predictive of in vivo sensitivity to dioxin-like compounds in birds. We investigated sources of interindividual variation in the CYP1A response to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in wild herring gulls and considered how this variation may complicate dioxin sensitivity estimates based on the CYP1A bioassay. Concentration-dependent effects of TCDD on CYP1A mRNA expression were characterized in 55 hepatocyte cultures prepared from individual herring gull embryos. A large degree of variability was observed among the hepatocyte culture preparations. For example, 1) basal CYP1A4 and CYP1A5 mRNA expression varied by 20- and 126-fold, respectively, among individuals, and 2) exposure to TCDD induced CYP1A4 mRNA expression by 57-fold in the most responsive sample but did not significantly induce CYP1A4 mRNA expression above baseline values in 42% of hepatocyte culture preparations. Environmental and genetic factors contributing to the observed variability are discussed. Despite the large amount of interindividual variation, we conclude that reproducible EC50-based estimates of species sensitivity can be obtained from the CYP1A cell culture bioassay when samples are collected from relatively uncontaminated colonies.

AB The objective of the present study was to establish a culture of Hyalella azteca that could be used for laboratory toxicity testing in low-ionic strength waters with electrical conductivities of H. azteca was collected from Twin Lake, a small seepage lake with an electrical conductivity of 81 +/- 27 mu S/cm located on the property of Chalk River Laboratories in Chalk River, Canada. To determine the minimum aqueous ion requirements for an optimal culturing medium for the Twin Lake strain, Twin Lake was monitored for water quality and ionic content over 4 yr. Water quality parameters were averaged and used to formulate a medium containing NaHCO3, CaCl2, MgSO4, KCl, NaBr, NaF, and LiCl, with an electrical conductivity of 89 +/- 3 mu S/cm. By evaluating survival and reproduction, it was concluded that this artificial medium promoted survival and supported reproduction (10 +/- 4 neonates/female/wk) of the Twin Lake amphipod. The Twin Lake strain of H. azteca can, therefore, be maintained in laboratory settings, and this allows for toxicity testing to be conducted on low-ionic strength waters.

AB The world-class Alaskan Bristol Bay salmon fishery and vast deposits of copper (Cu) and other metals in the watershed warrant further investigation into the potential toxicity of Cu to salmonids under the low water-hardness conditions that occur in the watershed. Therefore we investigated the acute toxicity of Cu to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) in low-hardness water (similar to 30 mg/L as CaCO3) formulated in the laboratory and collected from the Bristol Bay watershed. The median lethal concentration (LC50) for rainbow trout exposed to Cu in low-hardness laboratory water was 16 mu g Cu/L (95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 12, 21; dissolved Cu, filtered to 0.45 mu m). The LC50 values for fathead minnows exposed to Cu in low-hardness laboratory water or site water were 29 and 79 mu g Cu/L (95% CIs: 23, 35 and 58, 125; dissolved Cu), respectively. The biotic ligand model (BLM) LC50 estimates for these bioassays were 1.3 to 2.3 times higher than the actual LC50 values. We also calculated and analyzed acute Cu water quality criteria, also known as criterion maximum concentration (CMC), using hardness-based methods and the BLM for water samples collected throughout the Bristol Bay watershed in 2007. Biotic ligand model CMCs ranged from 0.05 to 17.5 mu g Cu/L and hardness-based CMCs ranged from 2.3 to 6.1 mu g Cu/L for the 65 samples analyzed. Our results show the need for site-specific research and subsequent water quality guidelines in low-hardness aquatic habitats. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:190-197. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Uranium (U) toxicity patterns for fish have been mainly determined under laboratory-controlled waterborne exposure conditions. Because fish can take up metals from water and diet under in situ exposure conditions, a waterborne U exposure experiment (20 mu g L-1, 20 d) was conducted in the laboratory to investigate transfer efficiency and target organ distribution in zebrafish Danio rerio compared with combined waterborne exposure (20 mu g L-1) and diet-borne exposure (10.7 mu g g(-1)). (233)Uranium was used as a specific U isotope tracer for diet-borne exposure. Bioaccumulation was examined in the gills, liver, kidneys, intestine, and gonads of D. rerio. Concentrations in the organs after waterborne exposure were approximately 500 ng g(-1) fresh weight, except in the intestine (> 10 mu g g(-1) fresh wt) and the kidneys (200 ng g(-1) fresh wt). No significant difference was observed between waterborne and diet-borne conditions. Trophic U transfer in organs was found but at a low level (< 10 ng g(-1) fresh wt). Surprisingly, the intestine appeared to be the main target organ after both tested exposure modalities. The gonads (57% at 20 d) and the liver (41% at 20 d) showed the highest accumulated relative U burdens. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:90-98. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Toxin-producing cyanobacteria are increasing in rivers and streams globally, leading to growing concerns over their potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems. The present study was designed to culture field-collected Phormidium in the laboratory, identify individual species, conduct chemical analyses to identify cyanotoxins, and conduct toxicity tests to investigate the potential for this genera to impact stream health. Freshwater toxicity tests were conducted with standard US Environmental Protection Agency invertebrate test protocols with culture water used to grow 3 Phormidium strains isolated from the Russian River (CA, USA). Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure total anatoxin concentrations. Culture waters from the 3 Phormidium strains were highly toxic to Ceriodaphnia dubia, Hyalella azteca, and Chironomus dilutus. The C. dubia 7-d survival median lethal concentrations were 0.71, 0.49, and 0.56g/L anatoxin for Phormidum strains 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The 7-d reproduction inhibitory concentrations, 25% were 0.55, 0.32, and 0.30g/L anatoxin for strains 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Chironomus dilutus survival was reduced at concentrations <2g/L anatoxin by all 3 strains, and the H. azteca 96-h lethal concentrations, 25% were 2.82, 1.26, and 5.30g/L for strains 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Additional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that the likely anatoxin variant in these cultures was dihydro-anatoxin-a. The results suggest that anatoxins produced by Phormidium have the potential to impact stream macroinvertebrates. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2851-2859. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Australian freshwaters have relatively low water hardness and different calcium (Ca) to magnesium (Mg) ratios compared with those in Europe. The hardness values of a substantial proportion of Australian freshwaters fall below the application boundary of the existing European nickel biotic ligand models (Ni BLMs) of 2mg Ca/L. Toxicity testing was undertaken using Hydra viridissima to assess the predictive ability of the existing Ni BLM for this species in extremely soft waters. This testing revealed an increased competitive effect of Ca and Mg with Ni for binding to the biotic ligand in soft water (<10mg CaCO3/L) than at higher water hardness. Modifications were made to the Ni BLM by increasing the binding constants for Ca and Mg at the biotic ligand to account for softer waters encountered in Australia and the more important competitive effect of Ca and Mg on Ni toxicity. To validate the modified Ni BLM, ecotoxicity testing was performed on 5 Australian test species in 5 different natural Australian waters. Overall, no single water chemistry parameter was able to indicate the trends in toxicity to all of the test species. The modified Ni BLMs were able to predict the toxicity of Ni to the test species in the validation studies in natural waters better than the existing Ni BLMs. The present study suggests that the overarching mechanisms defining Ni bioavailability to freshwater species are globally similar and that Ni BLMs can be used in all freshwater systems with minor modifications.

AB Because of increasing concerns about its toxic effects, bisphenol A (BPA) has been gradually replaced in industrial applications by analogs such as bisphenol S (BPS). Few comparative toxicity evaluations of bisphenol analogs have been done. In the present study, 72-h exposure in L1 larvae of the model animal Caenorhabditis elegans was used to evaluate low-concentration BPS toxicity. Multiple indicators at the physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels were tested. At the physiological level, BPS exposure resulted in significantly negative effects at treatments >1 mu M, with head thrash being the most sensitive endpoint. At the biochemical level, BPS exposure induced no significant oxidative stress, but significantly increased apoptosis at 1 mu M. At the molecular level, BPS exposure induced small but significant variations in most stress-related gene expressions at all doses. In addition, the transgenic nematode TJ375 cell line with the green fluorescent protein-based reporter hsp-16.2 was used to determine stress responses; it was found that TJ375 was not sensitive to BPS exposure. Compared with the effects of BPA shown in our previous 2016 study, the overall results showed that BPS was less noxious to C. elegans than BPA. These toxicity data for BPS could provide a foundation to evaluate the comparative toxicity of BPA alternatives. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2560-2565. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Anthropogenic activity is increasing the presence of contaminants that enter waterways through wastewater effluent and urban and/or agricultural runoff, generally in complex mixtures. Depending on the mode of action of the individual contaminant within the mixture, toxicity can occur due to contaminants having similar or dissimilar modes of action. However, it is unknown how the metabolome responds to sublethal contaminant mixtures in the keystone genus Daphnia. In the present study we examined D. magna metabolic responses to acute sublethal exposure of propranolol, carbamazepine, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) as well as in binary (propranolol-carbamazepine, propranolol-PFOS, carbamazepine-PFOS) and tertiary mixtures (carbamazepine-propranolol-PFOS), all at 10% of the median lethal concentration of the population (LC50). The metabolome was measured using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and characterized using principal component analysis, regression analysis, and fold changes in metabolite relative to the unexposed (control) group. The averaged principal component analysis scores plots revealed that carbamazepine-PFOS and carbamazepine-propranolol-PFOS exposures were significantly different from the control treatment. After normalizing the toxicity of each contaminant, we found that some metabolites responded monotonically, whereas others displayed a nonmonotonic response with increasing toxicity units. The single contaminant exposures and 2 binary mixtures (propranolol-carbamazepine, and propranolol-PFOS) resulted in minimal changes in the identified metabolites, whereas the carbamazepine-PFOS and carbamazepine-propranolol-PFOS displayed increases in several amino acid metabolites and decreases in glucose. Overall, our results highlight the sensitivity of the metabolome to distinguish the composition of the contaminant mixtures, with some mixtures displaying heightened responses versus others.

AB Ammonia is recognized as a major pollutant worldwide, originating from natural and anthropogenic sources. Studies have reported that freshwater mussels are among the most sensitive taxa to ammonia, but few data are available on ammonia toxicity for the early life stages of freshwater mussels from tropical regions. We report on the modification of a 24-h acute toxicity test protocol for tropical freshwater mussels and application of the test using ammonia. Velesunio spp. from 3 different sites were used to assess the toxicity of ammonia at a targeted pH of 6.0 and a water temperature of 27.5 degrees C, which were the average annual values for some slightly to moderately acidic, soft water (3-6mg/L as CaCO3) creeks of tropical northern Australia. The valve closure responses of mussel glochidia (larvae) to a sodium chloride solution were used to measure the survival endpoint. Acute toxicity estimates indicate that tropical Velesunio spp. were highly sensitive to ammonia, with 24-h exposures to ammonium sulfate generating median lethal concentration estimates ranging from 6.8 to 14.2mg/L total ammonia nitrogen, which, when adjusted to pH 7 and 20 degrees C, were among the highest sensitivities yet reported for any freshwater mussel species, and among the highest in sensitivity for any tropical taxon. These toxicity estimates can contribute to the derivation or refinement of ammonia guideline values for freshwater ecosystems globally. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2175-2187. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Under natural conditions, organisms can experience a variety of abiotic (e.g., temperature, pH) and biotic (e.g., species interactions) factors, which can interact with toxicant effects. By ignoring species interactions conventional ecotoxicological studies (i.e., single-species tests) oversimplify the actual field situation. We investigated whether temperature and interspecific competition affected the effects of zinc (Zn) on a Daphnia longispina population. The D. longispina populations were exposed in a full factorial design to 3 different Zn treatments (background, 29, and 110g Zn/L), 2 different temperature regimes (cold, 17-18 degrees C; warm, 21-22 degrees C), and 2 interspecific competition levels (no interspecific Brachionus competition=no Brachionus calyciflorus added; interspecific Brachionus competition=B. calyciflorus added). Interspecific Brachionus competition and temperature by itself had a limited effect on the Daphnia abundance but significantly interacted with the highest Zn concentration. Without Brachionus competition the D. longispina juvenile and adult abundances under warm conditions were up to 5.5 and 21 times lower, respectively, in the high Zn treatment in comparison with the Zn control, whereas under cold conditions no significant Zn effect was observed. However, with Brachionus competition the highest Zn treatment was on average 2.2 times less toxic to the D. longispina juvenile abundance at higher temperatures. Under cold conditions the highest Zn treatment affected the juvenile abundance sooner and up to 9 times more negatively when simultaneously faced with Brachionus competition. It is possible that the competition for food reduced the amount of energy that could be used by D. longispina for reproduction, and the metabolic costs increased as a result of Zn stress. The present study clearly illustrated the influence of temperature and competition on the effects of a chemical stressor. Thus, not considering such factors in ecological risk assessment may underestimate or overestimate risks in aquatic ecosystems when extrapolating data from standard single-species tests to the field.

AB The present study presents a bioconcentration model for non-ionic, polar, and ionizable organic compounds in amphipod based on first-order kinetics. Uptake rate constant k(1) is modeled as logk(1) = 1/0:81/logK(OW)+0.15(root mean square error [RMSE] = 0.52). Biotransformation rate constant k(M) is estimated using an existing polyparameter linear free energy relationship model. Respiratory elimination k(2) is calculated as modeled k1 over theoretical biota-water partition coefficient K-blow considering the contributions of lipid, protein, carbohydrate, and water. With negligible contributions of growth and egestion over a typical amphipod bioconcentration experiment, the bioconcentration factor (BCF) is modeled as k(1)/(k(M) (+) k(2)) (RMSE = 0.68). The proposed model performs well for non-ionic organic compounds (log K-OW range = 3.3-7.62) within 1 log-unit error margin. Approximately 12% of the BCFs are underpredicted for polar and ionizable compounds. However, >50% of the estimated k(2) values are found to exceed the total depuration rate constants. Analyses suggest that these excessive k2 values and underpredicted BCFs reflect underestimation in Kbiow, which may be improved by incorporating exoskeleton as a relevant partitioning component and refining the membrane-water partitioning model. The immediate needs to build up high-quality experimental kM values, explore the sorptive role of exoskeleton, and investigate the prevalence of k(2) overestimation in other bioconcentration models are also identified. The resulting BCF model can support, within its limitations, the ecotoxicological and risk assessment of emerging polar and ionizable organic contaminants in aquatic environments and advance the science of invertebrate bioaccumulation.

AB Despite global efforts to reduce anthropogenic mercury (Hg) emissions, the timescale and degree to which Hg concentrations in the environment and biota respond to decreased emissions remain challenging to assess or predict. In the present study we characterize long-term trends and life-history patterns in Hg accumulation and toxicological implications of Hg contamination for a freshwater seal from one of the world's largest lakes (Lake Baikal, Siberia, Russia) using contemporary tissues and archival teeth. Stable isotope analysis and Hg analyses of soft tissues (muscle, liver, kidney, blood, brain, heart) and teeth from 22 contemporary seals revealed rapid changes in diet and Hg accumulation in the first year of life with a stable diet and increase in tissue Hg throughout the rest of life. Although maternal transfer of Hg was an important source of Hg to seal pups, reproduction and lactation by female seals did not appear to result in sex-related differences in Hg concentrations or age-related accumulation in adult seals. Based on Hg analysis of archival teeth (n = 114) and reconstructed values for soft tissues, we also assessed temporal trends in seal Hg between the years 1960 and 2013. Seal Hg concentrations in hard (teeth) and soft (e.g., muscle, liver) tissues were highest in the 1960s and 1970s, followed by a decrease. The decline in seal Hg concentrations in recent decades was most likely driven by a reduction in Hg inputs to the lake, suggesting that global and regional efforts to reduce Hg emissions have been successful at reducing ecosystem and human health risks posed by Hg in Lake Baikal.

AB Nine dietary exposure bioaccumulation fish tests with hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were conducted with common carp to explore how differences in test conditions (different test foods and feeding rates) influenced the lipid-corrected, growthcorrected kinetic biomagnification factor (BMFkgL) value (BMFkgL - BMFkg x lipid content of test food/lipid content of test fish). The BMFkgL values for HCB differed by approximately a factor of 5 among the tests. The average, median, 95% confidence interval, and coefficient of variation of the BMFkgL values were 0.925, 0.998, 0.578 to 1.27, and 49%, respectively. The BMFkgL value differed markedly between tests conducted using test food with lipid contents of approximately 5 and 15%. Different feeding rates (2 or 3% of body weight/d) had comparatively little effect on the BMFkgL of HCB. The present study revealed that the lipid content of test fish was correlated with the growth-corrected kinetic BMF (BMFkg) value of HCB but the lipid content of test food was poorly correlated with BMFkg. This lack of correlation might explain the large variations of the BMFkgL values observed. The value of the BMFkg normalized to a fish with a 5% lipid content (defined as the 5% lipid-normalized BMFkg in the present study) did not differ markedly between tests conducted using test food with different lipid contents (5-15%). It is therefore useful to report the 5% lipid-normalized BMFkg as well as the BMFkgL when dietary exposure tests are conducted. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB In recent decades there has been a growing interest in the development of new solvents from biomass. Some of these new solvents have been classified as green because of their renewable and sustainable source. However, characterization from the ecotoxicological and physicochemical points of view is needed to categorize them as green solvents. We have selected several key physicochemical properties that can reflect environmental features (density, boiling point, critical aggregation concentration, and log p) and explored their usefulness for preliminarily assessing the green character of the studied solvents. Specifically, we have studied several solvents from biomass: lactate family (methyl, ethyl, and butyl lactate), furfural family (furfural, 5-methylfurfural, furfuryl alcohol, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol), and levulinate family (methyl, ethyl, and butyl levulinate). To fill the gaps and complete some toxicity data for the environment, we have measured the ecotoxicity using 2 of the most common and versatile biomodels, bacteria Vibrio fischeri and crustacean Daphnia magna, for furfural-and lactatederived compounds. The results indicate that solvents from biomass can be categorized as green because their toxicity for the environment is low. Finally, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study was performed with the selected key properties and the ecotoxicological information. Despite the different structure of the chemicals under study, good correlations were found for the studied organisms. It seems that log p and critical aggregation concentration reflect the greatest part of the ecotoxic behavior, whereas density and boiling point cannot reflect toxicity signals. However, these properties are rather useful for assessing the final environmental fate of the studied chemicals. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Ecological risk assessment increasingly focuses on risks from chemical mixtures and multiple stressors because ecosystems are commonly exposed to a plethora of contaminants and nonchemical stressors. To simplify the task of assessing potential mixture effects, we explored 3 land use-related chemical emission scenarios. We applied a tiered methodology to judge the implications of the emissions of chemicals from agricultural practices, domestic discharges, and urban runoff in a quantitative model. The results showed land use-dependent mixture exposures, clearly discriminating downstream effects of land uses, with unique chemical signatures regarding composition, concentration, and temporal patterns. Associated risks were characterized in relation to the land-use scenarios. Comparisons to measured environmental concentrations and predicted impacts showed relatively good similarity. The results suggest that the land uses imply exceedances of regulatory protective environmental quality standards, varying over time in relation to rain events and associated flow and dilution variation. Higher-tier analyses using ecotoxicological effect criteria confirmed that species assemblages may be affected by exposures exceeding no-effect levels and that mixture exposure could be associated with predicted species loss under certain situations. The model outcomes can inform various types of prioritization to support risk management, including a ranking across land uses as a whole, a ranking on characteristics of exposure times and frequencies, and various rankings of the relative role of individual chemicals. Though all results are based on in silico assessments, the prospective land use-based approach applied in the present study yields useful insights for simplifying and assessing potential ecological risks of chemical mixtures and can therefore be useful for catchment-management decisions.

AB Based on previous research on the acute toxicity of major ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, and HCO3-/CO32-) to Ceriodaphnia dubia, a mathematical model was developed for predicting the median lethal concentration (LC50) for any ion mixture, excepting those dominated by K-specific toxicity. One component of the model describes a mechanism of general ion toxicity to which all ions contribute and predicts LC50s as a function of osmolarity and Ca activity. The other component describes Mg/Ca-specific toxicity to apply when such toxicity exceeds the general ion toxicity and predicts LC50s as a function of Mg and Ca activities. This model not only tracks well the observed LC50s from past research used for model development but also successfully predicts LC50s from new toxicity tests on synthetic mixtures of ions emulating chemistries of various ion-enriched effluents and receiving waters. It also performs better than a previously published model for major ion toxicity. Because of the complexities of estimating chemical activities and osmolarity, a simplified model based directly on ion concentrations was also developed and found to provide useful predictions.

AB West Nile virus (WNV) is maintained cryptically primarily in avian (passerine) populations, where it is transmitted by Culex spp. mosquitoes. Mosquito-control measures currently include physical activities to reduce mosquito-breeding sites and the application of mosquito larvicides or aerosolized insecticides to kill adults (adulticides) when arboviral diseases such as WNV or Zika virus are detected in mosquito populations. Organochlorine, organophosphorus, carbamate, and pyrethroid insecticides are often used. Previous work suggests an effect of pyrethroids on the immune system in a variety of vertebrates. We examined the effects of exposure to aerosolized Permanone (R) 30:30 insecticide (permethrin and piperonyl butoxide in soy oil vehicle) at approximately 10(3) to 10(6) times potential environmental concentrations on the response of captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to experimental challenge with WNV. Compared to vehicle control birds, WNV outcome was unchanged (65% of birds produced a viremia) in the low exposure (9.52 +/- 3.13mg/m(3) standard deviation [SD] permethrin) group but reduced in the high exposure (mean 376.5 +/- 27.9mg/m(3) SD permethrin) group (30% were viremic; p<0.05). After clearing WNV infection, birds treated with Permanone regained less body mass than vehicle-treated birds (p<0.001). The present study suggests that exposure to aerosolized Permanone insecticide at levels exceeding typical application rates has the potential to not change or to mildly enhance a bird's resistance to WNV.

AB Polyacrylamide has become an effective tool for reducing construction-related suspended sediment and turbidity, which are considered to have significant adverse impacts on aquatic ecosystems and are a leading cause of the degradation of North American streams and rivers. However, little is known about the effects of polyacrylamide on many freshwater organisms, and prior to the present study, no information existed on the toxicity of polyacrylamide compounds to native freshwater mussels (family Unionidae), one of the most imperiled faunal groups globally. Following standard test guidelines, we exposed juvenile mussels (test duration 96 h) and glochidia larvae (test duration 24 h) to 5 different anionic polyacrylamide compounds and 1 non-ionic compound. Species tested included the yellow lampmussel (Lampsilis cariosa), an Atlantic Slope species that is listed as endangered in North Carolina; the Appalachian elktoe (Alasmidonta raveneliana), a federally endangered Interior Basin species; and the washboard (Megalonaias nervosa), a common Interior Basin species. We found that median lethal concentrations (LC50s) of polyacrylamide ranged from 411.7 to > 1000 mg/L for glochidia and from 126.8 to > 1000 mg/L for juveniles. All LC50s were orders of magnitude greater (2-3) than concentrations typically recommended for turbidity control (1-5 mg/L), regardless of their molecular weight or charge density. The results demonstrate that the polyacrylamide compounds tested were not acutely toxic to the mussel species and life stages tested, indicating minimal risk of short-term exposure from polyacrylamide applications in the environment. However, other potential uses of polyacrylamide in the environment (e.g., wastewater treatment, paper processing, mining, algae removal) and their chronic or sublethal effects remain uncertain and warrant additional investigation.Published 2017 Wiley Periodicals Inc.

AB Tagetes erecta thrived in phytotoxic levels of cadmium (Cd; 50-300 mg kg(-1)) and copper (Cu; 150-400 mg kg(-1)) for 21 d. It accumulated high metal contents in its above-ground tissues (3675 mg Cd kg(-1) dry wt and 3948 mg Cu kg(-1) dry wt) and showed greater root to shoot translocation and a high extraction coefficient, all of which pointed toward its potential as a hyperaccumulator. Both Cd stress and Cu stress reduced the plant biomass, foliar area, and number. In addition, there were significant declines in pigment contents as well as boosts in lipid peroxidation levels. However, the plant triggered a number of stress-mitigation strategies to abate reactive oxygen species formed as a result of Cd/Cu excess, mostly via significant augmentation of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase activities. Though the root and leaf anatomy revealed some signs of toxic symptoms at 50 mg Cd kg(-1) and at 150 mg Cu kg(-1), as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy, the root showed maximum tolerance, with tolerance indexes of 85.4% and 91.7%, respectively. Energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis showed specific Ca2+ signals in both root and stomata, which could be associated with a specific signaling pathway leading to increased root metal uptake and stomatal closure.

AB Biological and chemical endpoints were measured in white sucker collected downstream of Athabasca oil sands developments (AB, Canada) and compared with those at Calling Lake (AB, Canada), a reference location upstream of the Athabasca oil sands deposit. Naphthenic acid concentrations were also measured at 14 sites in the Athabasca River watershed. Concentrations of naphthenic acids were elevated in tributaries adjacent to oil sands mining developments. Tributary naphthenic acid profiles were more similar to aged oil sands process water than samples from the Athabasca River, suggesting an influence of tailings in the tributaries. White sucker showed higher energy storage in the Athabasca River as indicated by significantly higher condition and liver size. White sucker were not investing that energy into reproductive effort as measured by gonad size and fecundity, which were significantly reduced relative to the reference location. White sucker showed increased exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as indicated by hepatic cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) activity and fluorescent bile metabolites, as well as higher concentrations of naphthenic acids in bile. Cadmium, copper, nickel, and selenium were also elevated in white sucker liver tissue compared with the reference location. Based on the exposure profile and response pattern observed, effects on energy storage and utilization in white sucker from the Athabasca River most likely resulted from exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons derived from petrogenic and pyrolytic sources.

AB Sewage sludge is an important amendment that enriches soils with organic matter and provides plants with nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. However, knowledge on the fate and effects of organic pollutants present in the sludge on soil organismsis limited. In the present study, the uptake of triclosan, galaxolide, and tonalide in the earthworm Dendrobaena veneta was measured 1 wk after amendment of agricultural soil with sewage sludge, while elimination kinetics were assessed over a 21-d period after transferring worms to clean soil. After 1-wk exposure, earthworms had accumulated 2.6 +/- 0.6 mu g g(-1) galaxolide, 0.04 +/- 0.02 mu g g(-1) tonalide, and 0.6 +/- 0.2 mu g g(-1) triclosan. Both synthetic musks were efficiently excreted and below the limit of quantification after 3 and 14 d of depuration for tonalide and galaxolide, respectively. Triclosan concentrations, on the other hand, did not decrease significantly over the depuration period, which may lead to the transfer of triclosan in the food web. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Ecotoxicity testing is a crucial component of chemical risk assessment. Still, due to methodological difficulties related to controlling exposure concentrations over time, data on long-term effects of organic chemicals at low concentrations are limited. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to test the applicability of passive dosing to maintain stable concentrations of the organochlorine bacteriocide triclosan in the water phase during a 6-wk multigeneration population development test with the harpacticoid copepod Nitocra spinipes. Triclosan was loaded into silicone (1000 mg), which was used as passive dosing phase in the exposure vials. The distribution ratio for triclosan between silicone and water (Dsilicone-water) was 10466 +/- 1927. A population development test was conducted at 3 concentration levels of triclosan that were measured to be 3 mu g/L to 5 mu g/L, 7 mu g/L to 11 mu g/L and 16 mu g/L to 26 mu g/L. The results demonstrate that passive dosing is applicable for long-term ecotoxicity testing of organic chemicals, including during significant growth of the test organism population. Shifts in the demographic structure of the population during exposure suggest the most severe effects were exerted on juvenile development. Progressively lower development index values in the populations exposed to increasing triclosan concentrations suggest developmental retardation. The results further stress the need for chronic exposure during ecotoxicity testing in chemical risk assessment because even the most sensitive endpoint was not significant until after 7 d of exposure.

AB The performance of aqueous exposure bioconcentration fish tests according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline 305 requires the possibility of preparing stable aqueous concentrations of the test substances. For highly hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs; octanol-water partition coefficient [log K-OW]> 5), testing via aqueous exposure may become increasingly difficult. A solid-phase desorption dosing system was developed to generate stable concentrations of HOCs without using solubilizing agents. The system was tested with hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o-terphenyl (oTP), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 153, and dibenz[a, h] anthracene (DBA) (log K-OW 5.5-7.8) in 2 flow-through fish tests with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The analysis of the test media applied during the bioconcentration factor (BCF) studies showed that stable analyte concentrations of the 4 HOCs were maintained in the test system over an uptake period of 8 wk. Bioconcentration factors (L kg(-1) wet wt) were estimated for HCB (BCF 35 589), oTP (BCF 12 040), and PCB 153 (BCF 18 539) based on total water concentrations. No bioconcentration could be determined for DBA, probably because of the rapid metabolism of the test item. The solid-phase desorption dosing system is suitable to provide stable aqueous concentrations of HOCs required to determine the bioconcentration in fish and represents a viable alternative to the use of solubilizing agents for the preparation of test solutions.(C) 2016 The Authors.

AB As the numbers of chemical contaminants in freshwater ecosystems increase, it is important to understand whether contaminants interact in ecologically important ways. The present study investigated the independent and interactive effects of 2 contaminants that frequently co-occur in freshwater environments among higher latitudes, including a commonly applied insecticide (carbaryl) and road salt (NaCl). The hypothesis was that the addition of either contaminant would result in a decline in zooplankton, an algal bloom, and the subsequent decline of both periphyton and periphyton consumers. Another hypothesis was that combining the contaminants would result in synergistic effects on community responses. Outdoor mesocosms were used with communities that included phytoplankton, periphyton, zooplankton, amphipods, clams, snails, and tadpoles. Communities were exposed to 4 environmentally relevant concentrations of salt (27 mg Cl- L-1, 77 mg Cl- L-1, 277 mg Cl- L-1, and 727 mg Cl- L-1) fully crossed with 4 carbaryl treatments (ethanol, 0 mu gL(-1), 5 mu g L-1, and 50 mu g L-1) over 57 d. Contaminants induced declines in rotifer and cladoceran zooplankton, but only carbaryl induced an algal bloom. Consumers exhibited both positive and negative responses to contaminants, which were likely the result of both indirect community interactions and direct toxicity. In contrast to the hypothesis, no synergistic effects were found, although copepod densities declined when high concentrations of both chemicals were combined. The results suggest that low concentrations of salt and carbaryl are likely to have mostly independent effects on aquatic communities. (C) 2016 SETAC

   workshops; Data quality
ID QUALITY; EXPRESSION
AB Agencies responsible for environmental protection are tasked with developing regulatory guidance that is based on the best available scientific evidence. Histopathology is a common endpoint in toxicologic bioassays; however, because of the subjective nature of this endpoint, and the advanced level of specialized training required for its effective utilization, the reliability of histopathology data can be inconsistent. Consequently, mechanisms for evaluating such data on a case-by-case basis are needed. The purposes of the present review are to describe a methodology that can be used to evaluate the credibility of histopathology findings and to discuss the results of such assessments as applied to real-world data collected from the scientific literature. A key outcome of these efforts was the finding that only 54% of the studies examined contained histopathology data that were considered to be either highly credible or credible, whereas data in 46% of those studies were of equivocal, dubious, or no credibility. In addition, the results indicated that the quality of the data examined tended to decline during the past 15 yr. The ultimate goals of the present review are to draw attention to reliability issues that can affect histopathology results, provide recommendations to improve the quality of this endpoint, and suggest an approach for the expeditious and judicious use of histopathology data in the weight-of-evidence determinations required for hazard and/or risk assessment. This exercise was conducted initially as part of a SETAC Pellston Workshop (TM) entitled "Environmental Hazard and Risk Assessment Approaches for Endocrine-Active Chemicals (EHRA): Developing Technical Guidance Based on Case Studies to Support Decision Making" that was held in Pensacola, Florida (USA) from 31 January to 5 February 2016.

AB To assess the influence of soil properties and aging on the availability and toxicity of zinc (Zn) applied as nanoparticles (Zn oxide [ZnO]-NPs) or as Zn2+ ions (Zn chloride [ZnCl2]), 3 natural soils were individually spiked with either ZnO-NPs or ZnCl2 and incubated for up to 6 mo. Available Zn concentrations in soil were measured by porewater extraction (ZnPW), whereas earthworms (Eisenia andrei) were exposed to study Zn bioavailability. Porewater extraction concentrations were lower when Zn was applied as NPs compared to the ionic form and decreased with increasing soil pH. For both Zn forms and Zn-PW values were affected by aging, but they varied among the tested soils, highlighting the influence of soil properties. Internal Zn concentration in the earthworms (ZnE) was highest for the soil with high organic carbon content (5.4%) and basic pH (7.6) spiked with Zn-NPs, but the same soil spiked with ZnCl2 showed the lowest increase in ZnE compared to the control. Survival, weight change, and reproduction of the earthworms were affected by both Zn forms; but differences in toxicity could not be explained by soil properties or aging. This shows that ZnO-NPs and ZnCl2 behave differently in soils depending on soil properties and aging processes, but differences in earthworm toxicity remain unexplained.

In the present study, concentrations of metals in dorsal muscle tissue of 5 fish species-goldeye, northern pike, walleye, whitefish, and burbot-from the Slave, Peace, and Athabasca Rivers were quantified. A suite of 25 metals including As, Hg, Se, Tl, and V was analyzed. Most metals exhibited no significant variations in concentration among locations. Concentrations of 5 metals, As, Hg, Se, Tl, and V, revealed significant variations among locations and were of sufficient magnitude to be of interest. Concentrations of Hg did not vary significantly among locations; however, because it was detected at concentrations of concern and the use of the selected fishes was a local source of food for humans and pets, it was of interest. Concentrations of As, Se, Tl, and V in dorsal muscle of certain fishes in the farthest downstream sites on the Slave River were greater than those in the same tissues and species in the farther upstream sites on the Peace and Athabasca Rivers. This phenomenon was most prevalent with Tl and to a lesser extent with As and Se. Nevertheless, concentrations were not of concern for the health of human consumers. Although metals did not appear to be increased in fish in the Alberta Oil Sands region in the present study, further research is needed to understand the potential impacts.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-16.

AB Neonicotinoids are a widely used class of pesticides. Co-exposure to neonicotinoids and other classes of pesticides can exert potentiating or synergistic effects, and these mixtures have been detected in human bodily fluids. The present review summarizes studies into the effects of neonicotinoid-containing pesticide mixtures on humans and other nontarget organisms. Exposure to these mixtures has been reported to result in reproductive and hormonal toxicity, genotoxicity, neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and immunotoxicity in vertebrates. Mortality of pollinators and toxicity in other organisms has also been reported. The underlying mechanism of pesticide mixture toxicity may be associated with impairment of cytochrome 450 enzymes, which are involved in metabolizing pesticides. However, a comprehensive explanation of the adverse effects of neonicotinoid-containing pesticide mixtures is still required so that effective prevention and control measures can be formulated.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-10.

AB We reviewed the literature on toxicity of nanoparticulate nickel (nano-Ni) to aquatic organisms, from the perspective of relevance and reliability in a regulatory framework. Our main findings were 1) much of the published nano-Ni toxicity data is of low or medium quality in terms of reporting key physical-chemical properties, methodologies, and results, compared with published dissolved nickel studies; and 2) based on the available information, some common findings about nanoparticle (NP) toxicity are not supported for nano-Ni. First, we concluded that nanoparticulate elemental nickel and nickel oxide, which differ in chemical composition, generally did not differ in their toxicity. Second, there is no evidence that the toxicity of nano-Ni increases as the size of the NPs decreases. Third, for most organisms tested, nano-Ni was not more toxic on a mass-concentration basis than dissolved Ni. Fourth, there is conflicting evidence about whether the toxicity is directly caused by the NPs or by the dissolved fraction released from the NPs. However, no evidence suggests that any of the molecular, physiological, and structural mechanisms of nano-Ni toxicity differ from the general pattern for many metal-based nanomaterials, wherein oxidative stress underlies the observed effects. Physical-chemical factors in the design and conduct of nano-Ni toxicity tests are important, but often they are not adequately reported (e.g., characteristics of dry nano-Ni particles and of wetted particles in exposure waters; exposure-water chemistry).Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-23 (c) 2020 The Authors.Environmental Toxicology and Chemistrypublished by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of SETAC.

AB Multiple linear regression (MLR) models for predicting chronic aluminum toxicity to a cladoceran (Ceriodaphnia dubia) and a fish (Pimephales promelas) as a function of 3 toxicity-modifying factors (TMFs)-dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, and hardness-have been published previously. However, the range over which data for these TMFs were available was somewhat limited. To address this limitation, additional chronic toxicity tests with these species were subsequently conducted to expand the DOC range up to 12 mg/L, the pH range up to 8.7, and the hardness range up to 428 mg/L. The additional toxicity data were used to update the chronic MLR models. The adjustedR(2)for theC. dubia20% effect concentration (EC20) model increased from 0.71 to 0.92 with the additional toxicity data, and the predictedR(2)increased from 0.57 to 0.89. ForP. promelas, the adjustedR(2)increased from 0.87 to 0.92 and the predictedR(2)increased from 0.72 to 0.87. The high predictedR(2)relative to the adjustedR(2)indicates that the models for both species are not overly parameterized. When data forC. dubiaandP. promelaswere pooled, the adjustedR(2)values were comparable to the species-specific models (0.90 and 0.88 forC. dubiaandP. promelas, respectively). This indicates that chronic aluminum EC20s forC. dubiaandP. promelasrespond similarly to variation in DOC, pH, and hardness. Overall, the pooled model predicted EC20s that were within a factor of 2 of observed in 100% of theC. dubiatests and 94% of theP. promelastests.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-13. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Tributyltin is an organotin chemical that has been commonly used in ship antifouling paints. Despite the global total prohibition of tributyltin-based paint in 2008, tributyltin continues to be found at toxic levels in areas of high maritime traffic such as ports and harbors. A remediation program was conducted at a New Zealand port to reduce tributyltin and copper concentrations to acceptable values. The present study assessed the efficacy of the program using a combination of chemical analyses and copepod bioassays. Sediment and water samples were collected at 3 locations along a spatial gradient within the port, and concentrations of various organotin compounds and trace metal levels were measured pre- and postremediation. The toxicity of sediment and elutriate samples was estimated by benthic and pelagic copepod bioassays. Although acute toxicity in sediment samples was reduced following remediation, reproductive success was still affected for the benthic copepod. This approach combining chemical analysis and bioassays is promising for assessing the efficacy of remediation processes at contaminated marine sites. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-8. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Munitions constituents (MC) may be released into aquatic environments as a result of underwater military munitions (UWMM) corrosion and breach. The present study investigated the release of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) from Composition B fragments under 2 realistic exposure scenarios in a large flume with flow set at 15 cm/s: the first represented the release of MC from fully exposed Composition B, and the second represented release through a small hole, simulating a breached munition. Release of MC through a small hole was approximately 10 times lower than from exposed Composition B, demonstrating the strong influence of exposure to flow on release. The rate of release of MC into the flume was similar to that previously reported in a related field experiment, but a similar mass loss resulted in MC concentration in the field >300 times lower, likely by the dilution effect of hydrodynamic transport. The present study corroborates previous findings of release of MC at UWMM sites resulting in concentrations below the toxicity threshold to most species. In the flume water, MC was quantified using frequent grab sampling and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS). For TNT, POCIS-estimated time-weighted average concentrations were up to 40% higher than those derived from grab samples, whereas for RDX differences were 6% or less, demonstrating that POCIS provide reliable temporal integration of changing environmental concentrations for common MC.

AB A hybrid model was used to characterize potential ecological risks posed by atrazine to the endangered Topeka shiner. The model linked a Topeka shiner individual-based bioenergetics population model (TS-IBM) to a comprehensive aquatic system model (CASM(TS)) to simulate Topeka shiner population and food web dynamics for an Iowa (USA) headwater pool. Risks were estimated for monitored concentrations in Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska (USA), and for monitored concentrations multiplied by 2, 4, and 5. Constant daily atrazine concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 250 mu g/L were assessed. Exposure-response functions were developed from published atrazine toxicity data (median effect concentrations [EC50s] and no-observed-effect concentrations). Two toxicity scenarios were developed: the first included sensitive and insensitive species of algae, and the second reduced algal EC50 values to increase atrazine sensitivity. Direct and indirect effects of atrazine on Topeka shiner prey were modeled; direct effects on Topeka shiner were not assessed. Risks were characterized as differences between population biomass values of 365-d baseline and exposure simulations. The results indicated no discernable food web effects for monitored atrazine concentrations or constant exposures of 10 mu g/L on Topeka shiner populations for either toxicity scenario. Magnified monitored concentrations and higher constant concentrations produced greater modeled indirect effects on Topeka shiners. The hybrid model transparently combines species-specific and surrogate species data to estimate food web responses to environmental stressors. The model is readily updated by new data and is adaptable to other species and ecosystems. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-16. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB A quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS)-based extraction and simultaneous dispersive solid-phase extraction (dSPE) clean-up method was developed for contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in sediment samples. Hydration with a phosphate buffer (pH 2.0) and salting out with NaCl and MgSO4 facilitated the extraction and liquid-liquid portioning of the aqueous and organic phases. Cleanup of the extracts was achieved by florisil and C18 (1:1) sorbents in dSPE with minimal compromise of the analytes. The extracts were clean enough for determination by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The procedure was validated for preservatives, blood lipid regulators, analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, plasticizers, and other classes of CECs in sediment matrix spiked at 6 levels between 1- and 40-fold concentrations for CECs of varying analytical sensitivities. The recovery values were generally between approximately 27 and 120% and the relative standard deviation (%RSD) values were below 20% at 10- , 20- , and 40-fold spiking levels, albeit the recoveries for some analytes dropped at low spike concentrations. The method showed high sensitivity where the method detection limits (MDLs) were at low ppb levels for the majority of the analytes that ranged between 0.002 and 1.93 mu g/kg. The method performance was also compared with well-established US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Method 1694 by analyzing sediment samples collected from Yundang Lagoon (Xiamen, China) with field-incurred CEC residues. The sediment samples were detected with residues of parabens, gemfibrozil, ketoprofen, naproxen, fenoprofen, diclofenac, miconazole, carbamazepine, benzophenon-3, glibenclamide, sildinafil citrate, and some bisphenol analogues.

AB In Norway, mine tailings waste can be deposited by coastal submarine dispersal. Mine tailings slurry includes fine particles <10 mu m with elevated levels of metals (e.g., copper, iron) from residual mineral ore. Prolonged suspension of small particles in the water column may bring them into contact with locally spawned pelagic fish eggs, including Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua. Newly fertilized cod embryos were exposed to suspended mine tailings particles up to 3.2 mg/L in flow-through aquaria for a total of 21 d. Significantly more particles adhered to the surface of the chorion from the high treatment after 11-d exposure, and dissolved Cu concentrations increased in the water (up to 0.36 +/- 0.06 mu g/L). There was no adverse effect on embryo mortality but an 8% elevation in larval mortality. There were no differences with treatment on timing of hatching, embryo and larva morphometrics, abnormalities, or cardiac activity. There was a treatment-dependent up-regulation of stress marker genes (hspa8, cyp1c1) but no indication of metal-induced activation of metallothionien (mt gene transcription). Transcription markers for DNA and histone methyltransferases did show treatment-related up-regulation, indicative of altered methylation in larvae when developmental methylation patterns are determined, indicating some level of chronic toxicity that may have longer-term effects.

AB Sediment from a log pond located in south Finland contained 15 000 to 50 000 mg/kg dry weight of C-10-C-40 hydrocarbons. It was unclear whether they originated from the hydraulic fluid of the log hoist or the wood extractives. In the present study, methods of effect-directed analysis were used for the identification of toxicants. A combination of fractionation, biotesting, and chemical analyses revealed that the key toxicant of log pond sediment was retene, a dialkyl-substituted phenanthrene derived from wood resin acids. In addition, the most toxic fraction included 3 other wood-originated diterpenic compounds. Typical wood extractives such as sesquiterpenes and odd-carbon number alkanes in the range C-21-C-33 were identified in the fraction, which showed minor genotoxic potency. The most polar fraction contained triterpenes and showed estrogenic activity. No evidence for the presence of hydraulic fluid in sediment was found. The study also indicated that in cases where the organic matter content of sediment or soil is high, using the results of standard mineral oil analysis in risk management can lead to incorrect actions because standard methods do not differentiate petroleum hydrocarbons from biogenic hydrocarbons.

AB Some environmental pollutants impair mitochondria, which are of vital importance as energy factories in eukaryotic cells. Mitochondrial toxicity was quantified by measuring the change of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of HepG2 cells with the Agilent Seahorse XF(e)96 Analyzer. Various mechanisms of mitochondrial toxicity, including inhibition of the electron transport chain or adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase as well as uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, were differentiated by dosing the sample in parallel with reference compounds following the OCR over time. These time-OCR traces were used to derive effect concentrations for 10% inhibition of the electron transport chain or 10% of uncoupling. The low effect level of 10% was necessary because environmental mixtures contain thousands of chemicals; only few of them interfere with mitochondria, but the others cause cytotoxicity. The OCR bioassay was validated with environmental pollutants of known mechanism of mitochondrial toxicity. Binary mixtures of uncouplers or inhibitors acted according to the mixture model of concentration addition. Uncoupling and/or inhibitory effects were detected in extracts of river water samples without apparent cytotoxicity. Uncoupling effects could only be quantified in water samples if inhibitory effects occurred at lower concentrations because no uncoupling can be detected without an appreciable membrane potential built up. The OCR bioassay can thus complement chemical analysis and in vitro bioassays for monitoring micropollutants in water.Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-12. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Receiving waters from agricultural areas can contain multiple pesticides such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the fungicide tebuconazole, leading to the potential for aquatic life to be exposed to such mixtures. In the present study, the effects of tebuconazole were tested alone and in binary mixtures with imidacloprid on 4 aquatic invertebrates: Chironomus dilutus, Hyalella azteca, Lumbriculus variegatus, and Neocloeon triangulifer. Acute (96-h) median lethal concentrations (LC50s) were derived for individual compounds and used to design a binary mixture study to determine cumulative effects. The LC50s showed that imidacloprid was more potent than tebuconazole by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude for the 4 species. Lethality data from mixture experiments were analyzed using MIXTOX to determine deviations from independent action, followed by the model deviation ratio (MDR) technique to determine the biological significance and reproducibility of observed mixture effects. MIXTOX showed that the cumulative toxicities of imidacloprid-tebuconazole differed between the species: for C. dilutus there was no deviation from independent action; however, for H. azteca the mixture was antagonistic (specifically dose ratio-dependent), and for N. triangulifer it was synergistic. The MDR method showed that only observations with H. azteca significantly deviated from independent action. Because of the lack of evidence of a clear deviation from independent action and the much greater potency of imidacloprid, the weight of evidence indicates that the presence of tebuconazole is unlikely to appreciably increase the hazard from imidacloprid exposure to aquatic invertebrates.

AB Current soil remediation guidelines for metals reflect single-generation laboratory studies, but in the field, organisms are exposed to metals for more than one generation. The present study assessed the multigenerational effect of zinc (Zn) on Oppia nitens under a pulse or continuous exposure scenario. Synchronized adult mites (parents) were exposed to 6 concentrations of Zn in a field soil. For the pulse exposure, juveniles of parent mites from 3 of the 6 concentrations (105, 158, 237, 335, 553, and 800 mg/kg) were kept in clean media and reared until the third generation. At every generation, the sensitivity of the mites to Zn was tested in a dose-response manner. For the continuous exposure, the mites produced from the parents were re-exposed to the same concentration as their parents. According to critical-level estimates like the median effect concentration, all populations of the F2 and F3 generation mites in the pulse exposure were less sensitive to Zn than the parents and were protected at 250 mg/kg of Zn (Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment [2018] soil quality guideline). However, the mite generations of the continuous exposure remained as sensitive as the parent generation and were not protected by the Zn guideline level. The Zn niche width narrowed considerably for all continuously exposed mite populations, indicating that they were more sensitive than the parent. Our results show that Zn has a deleterious multigenerational effect on continuously exposed populations of mites. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:896-904. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB In previous work we intensively studied the acute responses of the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia to major geochemical ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, and HCO3-/CO32-), culminating in the development of models to predict acute toxicity from ionic composition. To quantitatively evaluate whether the toxicological behavior of major ions observed for C. dubia extends to chronic toxicity, we conducted 58 chronic toxicity tests with individual major salts and binary mixtures thereof. Chronic responses paralleled those demonstrated previously for acute exposure, specifically 1) similar relative toxicity of individual salts; 2) different Na salts showing similar potency when exposure is expressed as osmolarity; 3) toxicity of Mg, Ca, and K salts related to cation activity; 4) decreased toxicity of Na and Mg salts when Ca activity is increased at less than toxic concentrations; 5) additive behavior for salt mixtures sharing a common cation; and 6) independent behavior for salt mixtures with dissimilar cations, except Mg/Ca mixtures which appeared additive. Acute-to-chronic ratios were fairly consistent among salts, with values of approximately 1.8 for acute 50% lethal concentration (LC50) to chronic 50% effect concentration (EC50) and 2.8 for LC50/EC20 when expressed on an activity basis. Adjusting the previous acute toxicity model for acute-to-chronic ratios yielded chronic models that predict chronic toxicity within the range of intertest variability. Because these models are informed by a wide range of ion mixtures, they should provide robust assessment tools for natural waters enriched with major ions. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:769-783.

AB Substances of unknown or variable composition, complex reaction products, and biological materials (UVCBs) comprise approximately 40% of all registered substances submitted to the European Chemicals Agency. One of the main characteristics of UVCBs is that they have no unique representation. Industry scientists who are part of the scientific community have been working with academics and consultants to address the problem of a lack of a defined structural description. It has been acknowledged that one of the obstacles is the large number of possible structural isomers. We have recently proposed and published a methodology, based on the generic substance identifiers, to address this issue. The methodology allows for the coding of constituents, their generation, calculation of important characteristics of UVCB constituents, and selection of representative constituents. In the present study we introduce a statistical selection of the minimum number of generated constituents representing a UVCB. This representative sample was selected in such a way that the structural variability and the properties of concern of the UVCB were approximated within a predefined tolerable error. The aim of the statistical selection was to enable the assessment of UVCB substances by decreasing the number of constituents that need to be evaluated. The procedure, which was shown to be endpoint-independent, was validated theoretically and on real case studies. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:682-694. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) link toxicity across levels of biological organization, and thereby facilitate the development of suborganismal responses predictive of whole-organism toxicity and provide the mechanistic information necessary for science-based extrapolation to population-level effects. Thus far AOPs have characterized various acute and chronic toxicity pathways; however, the potential for AOPs to explicitly characterize indirect, energy-mediated effects from toxicants has yet to be fully explored. Indeed, although exposure to contaminants can alter an organism's energy budget, energetic endpoints are rarely incorporated into ecological risk assessment because there is not an integrative framework for linking energetic effects to organismal endpoints relevant to risk assessment (e.g., survival, reproduction, growth). In the present analysis, we developed a generalized bioenergetics-AOP in an effort to make better use of energetic endpoints in risk assessment, specifically exposure scenarios that generate an energetic burden to organisms. To evaluate empirical support for a bioenergetics-AOP, we analyzed published data for links between energetic endpoints across levels of biological organization. We found correlations between 1) cellular energy allocation and whole-animal growth, and 2) metabolic rate and scope for growth. Moreover, we reviewed literature linking energy availability to nontraditional toxicological endpoints (e.g., locomotor performance), and found evidence that toxicants impair aerobic performance and activity. We conclude by highlighting current knowledge gaps that should be addressed to develop specific bioenergetics-AOPs. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:27-45. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Physical systems, such as currents and winds, have traditionally been considered responsible for transporting contaminants. Although evidence is mounting that animals play a role in this process through their movements, we still know little about how such contaminant biotransport occurs and the extent of effects at deposition sites. In the present study, we address this question by studying how rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata), a seabird that occurs in immense colonies (similar to 300 000 pairs at our study site, Teuri Island), affect contaminant levels at their colony and at nearby sites. More specifically, we hypothesize that contaminants are transported and deposited by seabirds at their colony and that these contaminants are passed on locally to the terrestrial ecosystem. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the concentration of 9 heavy metal and metalloids, as well as delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes, in bird tissues, plants, and soil, both within and outside of the colony. The results show that rhinoceros auklets transport marine-derived mercury (Hg), possibly from their wintering location, and deposit Hg via their feces at their breeding site, thereby contaminating plants and soils within the breeding colony. The present study confirms not only that animals can transport contaminants from marine to terrestrial ecosystems, potentially over unexpectedly long distances, but also that bird tissues contribute locally to plant contamination.

AB Studies were conducted to develop methods to assess the effects of a complex mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus). Treatments were administered by egg injection to compare embryonic effects of an environmentally relevant PCB congener mixture in the domestic chicken over a range of doses. Chicken eggs were injected with the PCB mixture with a profile similar to that found in avian eggs collected on the upper Hudson River, New York, USA, at doses that spanned 0 to 98g/g egg. Eggs were hatched in the laboratory to ascertain hatching success. In the domestic chicken, the median lethal dose was 0.3g/g. These data demonstrate adverse effects of an environmentally relevant PCB mixture and provide the basis for further work using in vitro and other models to characterize the potential risk to avian populations.

AB The effects of changing hydrodynamic conditions and changing temperatures on polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) sampling rates (R-s) were investigated for 12 crop protection chemicals. Exposure concentration was held constant in each laboratory experiment, and flow velocities were calculated from measured mass transfer coefficients of the water boundary layer near the surface of POCIS devices. At a given temperature R-s generally increased by a factor of 2 to 5 between a stagnant condition and higher flow velocities (6-21cm/s), but R-s for most compounds was essentially constant between the higher flow velocities. When temperature was varied between 8 and 39 degrees C for a given flow condition, R-s increased linearly. In general, R-s increased by a factor of 2 to 4 and 2 to 8 over this temperature range under flow and stagnant conditions, respectively. An Arrhenius model was used to describe the dependence of POCIS sampling rates on temperature. Adjustments of R-s for temperature did not fully explain observed differences between time-weighted average concentrations of atrazine determined from POCIS and from composite water sampling in a field setting, suggesting that the effects of other competing factors still need to be evaluated.

AB Currently, risk assessment for oil contamination does not consider behavioral responses of benthos to oil toxicity. Avoidance of oil-contaminated sediment by benthic amphipods, however, may be a highly sensitive endpoint for sublethal effects of commonly used distillate fuels. In the present study, the avoidance behavior of temperate freshwater (Gammarus pulex) and marine (Gammarus locusta) amphipods was tested by allowing them to choose between a reference sediment and a distillate marine grade A (DMA) oil-spiked sediment. Avoidance of DMA-spiked sediment at 1000mg/kg dry weight was significant within the total exposure time (96h) in G. pulex and within the first 72h in G. locusta in 1 of 2 tests. Absence of DMA avoidance at lower concentrations (250mg/kg dry wt) indicates that test species can only detect DMA above these concentrations. However, sensitivity to oil may vary according to the phenology and physiological conditions of the populations involved, such as the species temperature tolerance and reproductive stage. The results suggest that avoidance tests may be used as an alternative to traditional chronic toxicity tests provided that a causal link between avoidance and long-term effects can be established.

The study objectives were to determine 1) if fathead minnows and northern leopard frogs exposed to atrazine experience alterations in gene expression, and 2) whether these changes are elicited by a simulated herbicide mixture. Following a 7-d exposure to atrazine, female minnows were defeminized, whereas male frogs were feminized. The mixture did not elicit statistically significant effects in either species.

AB The present study assessed the relative risk of 29 chemical contaminants to aquatic wildlife in the Bohai region and the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers of China. River monitoring data from 2010 to 2015 for metals, pesticides, plasticizers, surfactants, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, flame retardants, and ammonia were collected. For each chemical, ecotoxicity data were compiled for Chinese-relevant aquatic species. The chemicals were ranked by relative risk either by comparing the ratios of the median river concentration divided by the median ecotoxicity concentration or by the percentage of river measurements which exceeded the lower 10th percentile ecotoxicity value. To provide context, these results were compared with the same analysis for rivers in the United Kingdom. From this collection of chemicals in Chinese rivers, the highest risks appear to be from Cu, closely followed by Zn, Fe, and Ni together with linear alkyl benzene sulfonate, nonylphenol, and NH3. This risk, particularly from the metals, can be several times higher than that experienced in UK rivers when using the same analysis. Ammonia median concentrations were notably higher in the Pearl and Yangtze than in UK rivers. The results suggest that China should focus on controlling metal contamination to protect its aquatic wildlife. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Although the complexity of contaminant mixtures in sediments can confound the identification of causative agents of adverse biological response, understanding the contaminant(s) of primary concern at impacted sites is critical to sound environmental management and remediation. In the present study, a stock mixture of 18 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds was prepared to reflect the variety and relative proportions of PAHs measured in surface sediment samples collected from discrete areas of a historically contaminated industrial estuary. This site-specific PAH stock mixture was spiked into nontoxic in-system and out-of-system field-collected reference sediments in dilution series spanning the range of previously measured total PAH concentrations from the region. Spiked sediments were evaluated in 10-d Leptocheirus plumulosus tests to determine whether toxicity in laboratory-created PAH concentrations was similar to the toxicity found in field-collected samples with equivalent PAH concentrations. The results show that toxicity of contaminated sediments was not explained by PAH exposure, while indicating that toxicity in spiked in-system (fine grain, high total organic carbon [TOC]) and out-of-system (course grain, low TOC) sediments was better explained by porewater PAH concentrations, measured using an antibody-based biosensor that quantified 3- to 5-ring PAHs, than total sediment PAH concentrations. The study demonstrates the application of site-specific spiking experiments to evaluate sediment toxicity at sites with complex mixtures of multiple contaminant classes and the utility of the PAH biosensor for rapid sediment-independent porewater PAH analysis.

AB Feminization of male and juvenile fish because of exposure to estrogens or estrogenic chemicals in effluents from central wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is a worldwide issue of concern. Intersex and induction of the female yolk protein, vitellogenin, in male and juvenile fish are robust biomarkers for estrogenic exposure, and feminized fish have been observed downstream of WWTP outlets in many countries. Danish central WWTPs reduce effluent estrogenicity effectively by advanced sewage treatment, and feminizations have not been observed downstream of central WWTP outlets. However, between 2000 and 2004, investigations of Danish streams not receiving sewage from central WWTPs revealed a high variation in vitellogenin concentrations of male juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta); some individuals had high concentrations, probably as a result of estrogenic point sources, and the plasma concentration was >50ngmL(-1) in 79% of the juvenile males. The streams were reinvestigated in 2010 to 2016, and the average male level had decreased to a hitherto unseen baseline level; in 2010 only 0.7% (one individual) of the males had a vitellogenin concentration >50ngmL(-1), which could indicate that the estrogenicity of the streams decreased after 2004. We examined possible estrogenic sources in streams unaffected by central WWTP effluents, and found that the reduced vitellogenin levels are most likely explained by a national effort to improve on-site wastewater treatment in scattered houses not connected to central WWTPs.

AB The formation of toluene by microbiological processes can confound environmental investigations relating to petroleum releases. This is because toluene is a constituent of petroleum and can move readily within wetland environments, and analysis for toluene in relation to a petroleum release can lead to incorrect assignment of detected biogenic toluene as related to the release. No legally defensible method of distinguishing biogenic and petrogenic origins of detectible concentrations of toluene have been demonstrated to date. Using example petrogenic samples and samples of peat from 2 wetland environments, a poor bog and a poor fen, the present study demonstrates the use of an established ASTM International analytical methodology that was originally designed for arson analysis for the determination of the origin of toluene. Environmental forensic data-interpretation methods such as chromatogram inspection and diagnostic ratios are shown to be capable of readily distinguishing biogenic and petrogenic origins of toluene.

AB Cell immobilization is an effective method to prolong the lifetime of a microorganism and has proven feasibility in some other biosensors. Thus, we studied the use of Escherichia coli immobilized by agar, gelatin, an agar/gelatin mixture, chitosan, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to screen toxicity electrochemically. The E. coli immobilized by PVA gel showed the highest apparent bioactivity and the longest storage time in pH 7.0 phosphate-buffered saline solution. Furthermore, the E. coli immobilized by different gels was applied in the toxicity determination via a reported ferricyanide-mediated electrochemical method, where 3,5-dichlorophenol (DCP) was used as a model toxin. The E. coli immobilized by PVA showed the highest sensitivity to DCP, and the corresponding value of 50% inhibition concentration was 9.62 mgL(-1). Inhibition concentrations were in the range of 6.32 to 13.75% when the E. coli immobilized by PVA was challenged by wastewater, which were comparable with values obtained with the standard luminescent bacteria method (effective inhibition were in the range 7.96-25.42% for the same samples). Given the apparent bioactivity, storage ability, and sensitivity to toxin, PVA was the best polymer to confine cells among the polymers used in the present study. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Sediment contamination is widespread and can be toxic to aquatic ecosystems and impair human health. Despite their significant ecological function, meio- and microbiota in aquatic ecosystems have been poorly studied in conventional sediment ecotoxicity tests because of the difficulty in sample collecting and identification. In the present study, a novel DNA metabarcoding method was used to assess the effects of spiked copper (Cu) on benthic eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities in laboratory sediment toxicity tests with macroinvertebrates, the chironomid Chironomus tepperi and the amphipod Austrochiltonia subtenuis. In addition to the obvious toxic effects to experimental animals, microbiota (bacteria, protists, algae, and fungi) were significantly altered by spiked Cu in the sediments. The phylogenetic diversity of eukaryotic communities was decreased after spiked-Cu exposure. Even a low-spiked Cu treatment (125 mg/kg) altered structures of eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities in the amphipod experiment. The present study demonstrates that measuring microbiota communities will expand our understanding of the influences of contaminants on aquatic ecosystems. Particularly, the alterations of phylogenetic biodiversity of eukaryotic communities and the structure of sedimentary communities are sensitive indicators for sediment contamination, which can be incorporated in the monitoring and assessment of sediment quality.

AB The avian embryo is an excellent model for testing adverse developmental effects of environmental chemicals as well as uptake and movement of xenobiotics within the egg compartments. Before incubation at embryonic day 0, C-14 3,3',4, 4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (C-14 PCB 77) was injected into Japanese quail eggs either onto the air cell or into the albumen. All egg components were collected on embryonic day 1, 5, or 10, and concentrations of C-14 PCB 77 were measured in various egg components (shell, membrane, yolk, albumen, and embryo). The results showed measurable C-14 PCB 77 in all egg components, with changing concentrations in each egg component over the course of embryonic development. Specifically, concentrations in the shell content decreased between embryonic days 1 and 10, increased in albumen from embryonic days 1 to 5 and then decreased at embryonic day 10, and increased in both yolk and embryo from embryonic days 1 to 10. Vehicle and injection site both influenced C-14 PCB 77 allantoic fluid concentrations, with little effect on other egg components except for the inner shell membrane. The fatty acid vehicle injected into the albumen yielded the highest C-14 PCB 77 recovery. These findings demonstrate dynamic movement of toxicants throughout the egg components during avian embryonic development and a steady increase of relatively low levels of C-14 PCB 77 in the embryo compared with the yolk, albumen, and shell, suggesting that embryonic uptake (i.e., exposure) mirrors utilization of egg components for nutrition and growth during development.

TI Flow-Covariate Prediction of Stream Pesticide Concentrations
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Pesticide; Water quality; Environmental modeling; Time series; Kriging
AB Potential peak functions (e.g., maximum rolling averages over a given duration) of annual pesticide concentrations in the aquatic environment are important exposure parameters (or target quantities) for ecological risk assessments. These target quantities require accurate concentration estimates on nonsampled days in a monitoring program. We examined stream flow as a covariate via universal kriging to improve predictions of maximum m-day (m = 1, 7, 14, 30, 60) rolling averages and the 95th percentiles of atrazine concentration in streams where data were collected every 7 or 14 d. The universal kriging predictions were evaluated against the target quantities calculated directly from the daily (or near daily) measured atrazine concentration at 32 sites (89 site-yr) as part of the Atrazine Ecological Monitoring Program in the US corn belt region (2008-2013) and 4 sites (62 site-yr) in Ohio by the National Center for Water Quality Research (1993-2008). Because stream flow data are strongly skewed to the right, 3 transformations of the flow covariate were considered: log transformation, short-term flow anomaly, and normalized Box-Cox transformation. The normalized Box-Cox transformation resulted in predictions of the target quantities that were comparable to those obtained from log-linear interpolation (i.e., linear interpolation on the log scale) for 7-d sampling. However, the predictions appeared to be negatively affected by variability in regression coefficient estimates across different sample realizations of the concentration time series. Therefore, revised models incorporating seasonal covariates and partially or fully constrained regression parameters were investigated, and they were found to provide much improved predictions in comparison with those from log-linear interpolation for all rolling average measures.

AB There is global demand for new in vitro testing tools for ecological risk assessment. The objective of the present study was to apply a set of cell-free neurochemical assays to screen many chemicals across many species in a relatively high-throughput manner. The platform assessed 7 receptors and enzymes that mediate neurotransmission of -aminobutyric acid, dopamine, glutamate, and acetylcholine. Each assay was optimized to work across 20 vertebrate species (5 fish, 5 birds, 7 mammalian wildlife, 3 biomedical species including humans). We tested the screening assay platform against 80 chemicals (23 pharmaceuticals and personal care products, 20 metal[loid]s, 22 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and halogenated organic compounds, 15 pesticides). In total, 10 800 species-chemical-assay combinations were tested, and significant differences were found in 4041 cases. All 7 assays were significantly affected by at least one chemical in each species tested. Among the 80 chemicals tested, nearly all resulted in a significant impact on at least one species and one assay. The 5 most active chemicals were prochloraz, HgCl2, Sn, benzo[a]pyrene, and vinclozolin. Clustering analyses revealed groupings according to chemicals, species, and chemical-assay combinations. The results show that cell-free assays can screen a large number of samples in a short period of time in a cost-effective manner in a range of animals not easily studied using traditional approaches. Strengths and limitations of this approach are discussed, as well as next steps. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3081-3090. (c) 2017 SETAC

AB Extensive agricultural use of neonicotinoid insecticide products has resulted in the presence of neonicotinoid mixtures in surface waters worldwide. Although many aquatic insect species are known to be sensitive to neonicotinoids, the impact of neonicotinoid mixtures is poorly understood. In the present study, the cumulative toxicities of binary and ternary mixtures of select neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam) were characterized under acute (96-h) exposure scenarios using the larval midge Chironomus dilutus as a representative aquatic insect species. Using the MIXTOX approach, predictive parametric models were fitted and statistically compared with observed toxicity in subsequent mixture tests. Single-compound toxicity tests yielded median lethal concentration (LC50) values of 4.63, 5.93, and 55.34g/L for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, respectively. Because of the similar modes of action of neonicotinoids, concentration-additive cumulative mixture toxicity was the predicted model. However, we found that imidacloprid-clothianidin mixtures demonstrated response-additive dose-level-dependent synergism, clothianidin-thiamethoxam mixtures demonstrated concentration-additive synergism, and imidacloprid-thiamethoxam mixtures demonstrated response-additive dose-ratio-dependent synergism, with toxicity shifting from antagonism to synergism as the relative concentration of thiamethoxam increased. Imidacloprid-clothianidin-thiamethoxam ternary mixtures demonstrated response-additive synergism. These results indicate that, under acute exposure scenarios, the toxicity of neonicotinoid mixtures to C. dilutus cannot be predicted using the common assumption of additive joint activity. Indeed, the overarching trend of synergistic deviation emphasizes the need for further research into the ecotoxicological effects of neonicotinoid insecticide mixtures in field settings, the development of better toxicity models for neonicotinoid mixture exposures, and the consideration of mixture effects when setting water quality guidelines for this class of pesticides.

AB Residential indoor environments are potential sources of exposure to pyrethroids, which have low acute toxicity to humans but are allergenic and suspected endocrine disruptors. The present study evaluated the persistence of the pyrethroids cypermethrin and beta-cyfluthrin on indoor surfaces and in house dust. Cypermethrin and beta-cyfluthrin were applied and maintained on aluminum foils and in dust samples for 112d under controlled conditions and for 12mo in a test house; periodically, they were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Cypermethrin and beta-cyfluthrin concentrations showed decreases of 10.1% and 7.7% on aluminum foils, and 12.7% and 16.4% in dust, respectively, at 112d under controlled conditions. In the test house, cypermethrin and beta-cyfluthrin concentrations decreased by 40.3% and 60.2% on aluminum foils, and 29.6% and 56.2% in dust at the end of the study. The results show the considerable persistence of cypermethrin and beta-cyfluthrin indoors and indicate the risk of exposure to these products. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:2895-2898. (c) 2017 SETAC

AB The present study shows the comet assay technique being successfully applied for the first time to one of the most widely used soil organisms in standardized ecotoxicological tests, Folsomia candida, providing a step forward in assessing the genotoxicity induced by xenobiotics. Because collembolans have a high content of chitin, a new methodology was developed in which the heads of the collembolans were separated from the rest of the body, allowing the hemolymph to leak out. This procedure allows the cells to be released, and after lysis the genetic material is available for the comet assay. Among other key procedures, the use of 30 organisms (20- to 22-d-old adults) per replicate and the correct amount of cells with genetic material (translated as 10 mu L of suspension) applied on the agarose gel were determinants for the success of the results obtained. The methodology was validated by exposing F. candida to a representative metallic element (cadmium) and a representative of organophosphates, the insecticide dimethoate, for a shorter time period of 10 d, compared with the 28 d for the International Organization for Standardization 11267 method. Within this method, the relatively low percentage of DNA damage (30%) observed in controls and the significant increase in terms of percentage of DNA damage for almost all the concentrations of dimethoate and Cd (reaching 52% and 56% of damage in the highest concentrations, respectively) confirmed the genotoxic effect of both compounds and validated this technique. The comet assay proved to be a sensitive technique to detect DNA strand breaks in collembolans' cells. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB A rapid monitoring platform for sensitive voltammetric detection of thiamethoxam residues is reported in the present study. A beta-cyclodextrin-reduced graphene oxide composite was used as a reinforcing material in electrochemical determination of thiamethoxam. Compared with bare glassy carbon electrodes, the reduction peak currents of thiamethoxam at reduced graphene oxide/glassy carbon electrode and beta-cyclodextrin-reduced graphene oxide/glassy carbon electrode were increased by 70- and 124-fold, respectively. The experimental conditions influencing voltammetric determination of thiamethoxam, such as the amount of beta-cyclodextrin-reduced graphene oxide, solution pH, temperature, and accumulation time, were optimized. The reduction mechanism and binding affinity of this material is also discussed. Under optimal conditions, the reduction peak currents increased linearly between 0.5 mu M and 16 mu M concentration of thiamethoxam. The limit of detection was 0.27 mu M on the basis of a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. When the proposed method was applied to brown rice in a recovery test, the recoveries were between 92.20% and 113.75%. The results were in good concordance with the high-performance liquid chromatography method. The proposed method therefore provides a promising and effective platform for sensitive and rapid determination of thiamethoxam. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Our ability to conduct whole-organism toxicity tests to understand chemical safety has been outpaced by the synthesis of new chemicals for awide variety of commercial applications. As a result, scientists and risk assessors are turning to mechanistically based studies to increase efficiencies in chemical risk assessment and making greater use of in vitro and in silico methods to evaluate potential environmental and human health hazards. In this context, the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework has gained traction in regulatory science because it offers an efficient and effective means for capturing available knowledge describing the linkage between mechanistic data and the apical toxicity end points required for regulatory assessments. A number of international activities have focused on AOP development and various applications to regulatory decision-making. These initiatives have prompted dialogue between research scientists and regulatory communities to consider how best to use the AOP framework. Although expert-facilitated discussions and AOP development have been critical in moving the science of AOPs forward, it was recognized that a survey of the broader scientific and regulatory communities would aid in identifying current limitations while guiding future initiatives for the AOP framework. To that end, a global horizon scanning exercise was conducted to solicit questions concerning the challenges or limitations that must be addressed to realize the full potential of the AOP framework in research and regulatory decision-making. The questions received fell into several broad topical areas: AOP networks, quantitative AOPs, collaboration on and communication of AOP knowledge, AOP discovery and development, chemical and cross-species extrapolation, exposure/toxicokinetics considerations, and AOP applications. Expert ranking was then used to prioritize questions for each category, where 4 broad themes emerged that could help inform and guide future AOP research and regulatory initiatives. In addition, frequently asked questions were identified and addressed by experts in the field. Answers to frequently asked questions will aid in addressing common misperceptions and will allow for clarification of AOP topics. The need for this type of clarification was highlighted with surprising frequency by our question submitters, indicating that improvements are needed in communicating the AOP framework among the scientific and regulatory communities. Overall, horizon scanning engaged the global scientific community to help identify key questions surrounding the AOP framework and guide the direction of future initiatives. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB The study goal was to develop a sediment polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) dose-response model based on benthic invertebrate effects to PCBs. The authors used an equilibrium partitioning (EqP) approach to generate predicted PCB sediment effect concentrations (largely Aroclor 1254) associated with a gradient of toxic effects in benthic organisms from effects observed in aquatic toxicity studies. The present study differs from all other EqP collective sediment investigations in that the authors examined a common dose-response gradient of effects for PCBs rather than a single, protective value. The authors reviewed the chronic aquatic toxicity literature to identify measured aqueous PCB concentrations and associated benthic invertebrate effects. The authors control-normalized the aquatic toxic effect data and expressed results from various studies as a common metric, percent injury. Then, they calculated organic carbon-normalized sediment PCB concentrations (mg/kg organic carbon) from the aqueous PCB toxicity data set using EqP theory based on the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPIWEB 4.1) derivation of the water-organic carbon partition coefficient (K-OC). Lastly, the authors constructed a nonlinear dose-response numerical model for these synoptic sediment PCB concentrations and biological effects: Y = 100/1+10(([logEC50-logX] x [Hill slope])) (EC50 = median effective concentration). These models were used to generate " lookup" tables reporting percent injury in benthic biota for a range of Aroclor-specific sediment concentrations. For example, the model using the EPIWEB KOC estimate predicts mean benthic injury of 23.3%, 46.0%, 70.6%, 87.1%, and 95% for hypothetical sediment concentrations of 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg, and 16 mg/kg dry weight of Aroclor 1254, respectively (at 1% organic carbon). The authors recommend the model presented for screening but suggest, when possible, determining a site-specific KOC that, along with the tables and equations, allows users to create their own protective dose-response sediment concentration.

AB Knowledge regarding the potential impacts of crude oil on endocrine signaling in freshwater aquatic vertebrates is limited. The expression of selected genes as biomarkers for altered endocrine signaling was studied in African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, tadpoles and juvenile Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, exposed to weathered bunker and unweathered refinery crude oil water accommodated fractions (WAFs). In addition, the expression of the aforementioned genes was quantified in X. laevis tadpoles exposed to surface water collected from the proximity of an underground oil bunker. The (anti) estrogenicity and (anti) androgenicity of crude oil, crude oil WAFs, and surface water were furthermore evaluated using recombinant yeast. Thyroid hormone receptor beta expression was significantly down-regulated in X. laevis in response to both oil WAF types, whereas a further thyroid linked gene, type 2 deiodinase, was up-regulated in O. mossambicus exposed to a high concentration of bunker oil WAF. In addition, both WAFs altered the expression of the adipogenesis-linked peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in X. laevis. The crude oil and WAFs exhibited antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic activity in vitro. However, O. mossambicus androgen receptor 2 was the only gene, representing the reproductive system, significantly affected by WAF exposure. Estrogenicity, antiestrogenicity, and antiandrogenicity were detected in surface water samples; however, no significant changes were observed in the expression of any of the genes evaluated in X. laevis exposed to surface water. The responses varied among the 2 model organisms used, as well as among the 2 types of crude oil. Nonetheless, the data provide evidence that crude oil pollution may lead to adverse health effects in freshwater fish and amphibians as a result of altered endocrine signaling. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site, Nova Scotia, Canada, is considered a biological mercury (Hg) hotspot because the tissues of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and common loons (Gavia immer) inhabiting the lakes frequently exceed so-called safe levels of Hg. In the present study, the relationships between Hg and overall health of males and females of 3 forage fish species (brown bullhead Ameirus nebulosus, banded killifish Fundulus diaphanus, and golden shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas; n = 6-18/sex/lake) in 6 lakes at the park were assessed using condition factor, liversomatic index (LSI), and macrophage aggregates (MAs; indicators of tissue damage). Mean muscle total Hg (THg) concentrations of brown bullhead, banded killifish, and golden shiner across lakes were 0.32 mu g/g, 0.27 mu g/g, and 0.34 mu g/g, respectively. Condition was negatively related to muscle THg in golden shiner and banded killifish, LSI was not related to THg in any species, and all species showed evidence of increasing MA prevalence (counts and area) with increasing THg concentrations. The MAs were most prevalent in spleen tissues of golden shiner, with mean percentage cover ranging from 0.36% to 5.59% across lakes. In addition, the area of MAs appeared to be better predicted by THg concentration than was the number of MAs in the same tissue. These findings suggest that Hg is affecting the health of wild fishes in Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site and that other populations with similar or higher concentrations of this metal may also be at risk.

AB Neonicotinoids are prophylactically used globally on a variety of crops, and there is concern for the potential impacts of neonicotinoids on aquatic ecosystems. The intensive use of pesticides on crops has been identified as a contributor to population declines of amphibians, but currently little is known regarding the sublethal effects of chronic neonicotinoid exposure on amphibians. The objective of the present study was to characterize the sublethal effect(s) of exposure to 3 environmentally relevant concentrations (1g/L, 10g/L, and 100g/L) of 2 neonicotinoids on larval wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) using outdoor mesocosms. We exposed tadpoles to solutions of 2 commercial formulations containing imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, and assessed survival, growth, and development. Exposure to imidacloprid at 10g/L and 100g/L increased survival and delayed completion of metamorphosis compared with controls. Exposure to thiamethoxam did not influence amphibian responses. There was no significant effect of any treatment on body mass or size of the metamorphs. The results suggest that current usage of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam does not pose a threat to wood frogs. However, further assessment of both direct and indirect effects on subtle sublethal endpoints, and the influence of multiple interacting stressors at various life stages, is needed to fully understand the effects of neonicotinoids on amphibians.

AB During the last century the increase in the mean global temperatures has been shown to impact on freshwater physicochemical parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, or ultraviolet (UV) light abundance. Changes in these parameters could modify the toxicity of environmental pollutants. Therefore, in the present study, the authors studied the tolerance (survival and sublethal endpoints) of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to variations in pH (3-12), dissolved oxygen (3.9-237 mu mol/L) and UV intensity (55-467 mW/m(2)) using selected endpoints. Sublethal endpoint assessment included the quantification of hatching success, developmental delay, reduction of body length, frequency of edema, and morphological abnormalities. Median lethal concentrations (LC50s; 96-h) of 3.68 and 10.21 were determined for acid and alkaline pH, respectively. Embryo survival appeared to be relatively resistant to oxygen depletion with a 96-h LC50 of 0.42 mg/L. However, concentrations of 6 mg/L and below caused edema and developmental retardations. Continuous exposure to UV radiation affected zebrafish development by reducing survival and hatching rate and triggering a series of developmental abnormalities such as pericardial edema and deformities. A72-h LC50 of 227 mW/m(2) was derived from intensity-response modeling. By generation of concentration-response parameters the authors' data provide a basis for the subsequent assessment of combined effect of environmental stress parameters and chemicals. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Vernal pool fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, (Branchiopoda; Anostraca) and other fairy shrimp species have been listed as threatened or endangered under the US Endangered Species Act. Because few data exist about the sensitivity of Branchinecta spp. to toxic effects of contaminants, it is difficult to determine whether they are adequately protected by water quality criteria. A series of acute (24-h) lethality/immobilization tests was conducted with 3 species of fairy shrimp (B. lynchi, Branchinecta lindahli, and Thamnocephalus platyurus) and 10 chemicals with varying modes of toxic action: ammonia, potassium, chloride, sulfate, chromium( VI), copper, nickel, zinc, alachlor, and metolachlor. The same chemicals were tested in 48-h tests with other branchiopods ( the cladocerans Daphnia magna and Ceriodaphnia dubia) and an amphipod (Hyalella azteca), and in 96-h tests with snails (Physa gyrina and Lymnaea stagnalis). Median effect concentrations (EC50s) for B. lynchi were strongly correlated (r(2) (_) 0.975) with EC50s for the commercially available fairy shrimp species T. platyurus for most chemicals tested. Comparison of EC50s for fairy shrimp and EC50s for invertebrate taxa tested concurrently and with other published toxicity data indicated that fairy shrimp were relatively sensitive to potassium and several trace metals compared with other invertebrate taxa, although cladocerans, amphipods, and mussels had similar broad toxicant sensitivity. Interspecies correlation estimation models for predicting toxicity to fairy shrimp from surrogate species indicated that models with cladocerans and freshwater mussels as surrogates produced the best predictions of the sensitivity of fairy shrimp to contaminants. The results of these studies indicate that fairy shrimp are relatively sensitive to a range of toxicants, but Endangered Species Act-listed fairy shrimp of the genus Branchinecta were not consistently more sensitive than other fairy shrimp taxa.

AB Dechlorane Plus (DP) is found widely in the environment. It is important to study DP enrichment and biomagnification in terrestrial ecosystems to improve our understanding of the possible effects of DP on the environment and human health. A total of 90 samples, including plant and animal tissues, were collected from Xilingol Prairie in Inner Mongolia, China. The DP concentrations in different species were assessed, and transmission of DP through food webs containing ectotherms and endotherms was assessed. The compound was detected in the biotic samples (plant; range 0.133-0.422 ng/g dry wt), in animal muscle (range: not dected-5.70 ng/g lipid wt), and in animal hair (range: not dected-2.03 ng/g dry wt), indicating that DP is present in remote environments such as Xilingol Prairie. These findings suggest that DP can undergo long-distance transport in the environment. Biomagnification factors (ectotherms: range 0.146-88.0, endotherms: range 0.866-17.2) and anti-DP/total DP concentration ratios (f(anti) values of 0.412-0.787) for the prairie animals were calculated. Ectotherms were found to selectively enrich syn-DP, and stereoselective enrichment increased moving up the food web. Lower-trophic-level endotherms strongly stereoselectively enriched syn-DP, and higher-trophic-level endotherms stereoselectively enriched anti-DP. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-9. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Diltiazem is ubiquitously prescribed and has been reported in many effluents and freshwater bodies. Being a calcium channel blocker, diltiazem could disrupt the function of the sensory and central nervous systems. In the present study, using electro-olfactography (EOG), we investigated the interaction of diltiazem with the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of rainbow trout by looking into the detection threshold and effects of immediate (similar to 5 min) and acute (24 h) exposure to diltiazem at 6.6, 66, and 660 mu g/L. We also studied the accumulation of the drug in fish plasma and whole body. Brief exposure to diltiazem impaired the OSN response to a chemosensory stimulus in a concentration-dependent manner at 6.6 mu g/L and higher, whereas OSNs exposed for 24 h only displayed an impairment at 660 mu g/L. Chemical analysis showed that the accumulation of diltiazem in fish plasma and body correlated with the EOG response because it was 10 times higher in the group that displayed a significant impairment (660 mu g/L) compared to the other 2 groups (6.6, 66 mu g/L). This correlation suggests that the impact of diltiazem on OSNs might partially be through the accumulated molecules in the fish bloodstream. Fish did not detect diltiazem as a sensory stimulus even at concentrations as high as 660 mu g/L; thus, fish could potentially swim toward or fail to escape harmful concentrations of diltiazem.

AB Exposure to multiple classes of contaminants, both legacy and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), were assessed in tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) tissue and diet samples from 6 sites along the Maumee River, Ohio, USA, to understand both exposure and possible effects of exposure to those CECs for which there are little avian data. The 6 sites represented a gradient from intensive agriculture upstream to highly urbanized and industrial landscapes downstream; 1 or 2 remote Wisconsin lakes were assessed for comparative purposes. Cytochrome P450 induction, DNA damage, and thyroid function were also assessed relative to contaminant exposure. Bioaccumulative CECs, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated substances, did not follow any upstream to downstream gradient; but both had significantly greater concentrations along the Maumee River than at the remote lake sites. Greater exposure to PBDEs was apparent in swallows at or near wastewater-treatment facilities than at other sites. Total polychlorinated biphenyl and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were greater in swallows at downstream locations compared to upstream sites and were associated with higher ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase activity. Few herbicides or nonorganochlorine insecticides were detected in swallow tissues or their food, except for atrazine and its metabolite desethylatrazine. Few pharmaceuticals and personal care products were detected except for DEET and iopamidol. Both were detected in most liver samples but not in eggs, as well as detected at the remote lake sites. This is one of the most comprehensive assessments to date of exposure and effects of a wide variety of CECs in birds.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-17. (c) 2020 SETAC.

AB Sediment contamination of freshwater streams in urban areas is a recognized and growing concern. As a part of a comprehensive regional stream-quality assessment, stream-bed sediment was sampled from streams spanning a gradient of urban intensity in the Piedmont ecoregion of the southeastern United States. We evaluated relations between a broad suite of sediment contaminants (metals, current-use pesticides, organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, brominated diphenyl ethers, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), ambient sediment toxicity, and macroinvertebrate communities from 76 sites. Sediment toxicity was evaluated by conducting whole-sediment laboratory toxicity testing with the amphipod Hyalella azteca (for 28 d) and the midge Chironomus dilutus (for 10 d). Approximately one-third of the sediment samples were identified as toxic for at least one test species endpoint, although concentrations of contaminants infrequently exceeded toxicity benchmarks. Ratios of contaminant concentrations relative to their benchmarks, both individually and as summed benchmark quotients, were explored on a carbon-normalized and a dry-weight basis. Invertebrate taxa measures from ecological surveys tended to decline with increasing urbanization and with sediment contamination. Toxicity test endpoints were more strongly related to sediment contamination than invertebrate community measures were. Sediment chemistry and sediment toxicity provided moderate and weak, respectively, explanatory power for the similarity/dissimilarity of invertebrate communities. The results indicate that current single-chemical sediment benchmarks may underestimate the effects from mixtures of sediment contaminants experienced by lotic invertebrates.

AB There is no use restriction associated with bees for many fungicides used in agriculture; however, this does not always mean that these pesticides are harmless for these nontarget organisms. We investigated whether the fungicide pyraclostrobin, which acts on fungal mitochondria, also negatively affects honey bee mitochondrial bioenergetics. Honey bees were collected from 5 hives and anesthetized at 4 degrees C. The thoraces were separated, and mitochondria were isolated by grinding, filtering, and differential centrifugation. An aliquot of 0.5 mg of mitochondrial proteins was added to 0.5 mL of a standard reaction medium with 4 mM succinate (complex II substrate) plus 50 nM rotenone (complex I inhibitor), and mitochondrial respiration was measured at 30 degrees C using a Clark-type oxygen electrode. Mitochondrial membrane potential was determined spectrofluorimetrically using safranin O as a probe, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis was determined by chemiluminescence. Pyraclostrobin at 0 to 50 mu M was tested on the mitochondrial preparations, with 3 repetitions. Pyraclostrobin inhibited mitochondrial respiration in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 10 mu M and above, demonstrating typical inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. Pyraclostrobin also promoted a decline in the mitochondrial membrane potential at doses of 5 mu M and above and in ATP synthesis at 15 mu M and above. We conclude that pyraclostrobin interferes with honey bee mitochondrial function, which is especially critical for the energy-demanding flight activity of foraging bees.

AB Gonadal development in medaka (Oryzias latipes) is dependent on the synergy between estrogens and androgens. Disruption of steroid hormone levels can lead to ovo-testis. To determine the sensitive windows for hormonally induced sex reversal in medaka, we developed a novel 42sp50-GFP_ChgH-GFP transgenic medaka line, allowing the identification of female gonadal tissue by fluorescence present in developing oocytes. Germinal transgenesis resulted in a stable line exhibiting a strong green fluorescent protein signal constitutively in the ovaries and in the liver in response to estrogens. The sensitivity of this line to disruption of sex determination following 16-d chronic exposures was in the nanograms per liter range. To identify the developmental period sensitive to exogenous agents, fry were exposed to 24-h pulses of high concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) or 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) at various time points between days postfertilization (dpf) 0 and 12. Evaluation of phenotype followed by genotyping at 16 dpf revealed sensitivity to E2 between 1 and 8 dpf as well as 2 periods of susceptibility to DHT between 0 and 1 dpf and 4 and 8 dpf. No phenotypic sex reversal was detected after exposure to DHT or E2 on 11 or 12 dpf. The observed effects persisted to at least 24 dpf. The identified sensitive embryonic time periods for disruption of sex determination will aid future research on sex determination and the development of screening assays using early embryonic life stages.

AB We applied and tested a bioenergetic-based, steady-state food web bioaccumulation model to predict polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposures in sport fish of the Detroit River (USA-Canada), which is a Great Lakes area of concern. The PCB concentrations in the sediment and water of the river were found to exhibit high spatial variation. The previously contained areas of high contamination may have spread to adjacent food webs as a result of fish movements. This process may cause biased predictions in single-compartment bioaccumulation models. We performed multiple simulations and contrasted model predictions against a database of 1152 fish sample records comprising 19 sport fish species. The simulations evaluated 4 spatial scales (river-wide, 2-nation, 4-zone, and 6-zone models) to reveal how the spatial heterogeneity of contamination and species-specific movements contribute to variation in fish PCB exposures. The model testing demonstrated that the 2-nation model provided the most accurate global prediction of fish contamination. However, these improvements were not equally observed across all species. The model was subsequently calibrated for poorly performing species, by allowing cross-zone exposures, demonstrating the importance of accounting for specific ecological factors, such as fish movement, to improve PCB bioaccumulation prediction, especially in highly heterogeneous water systems.

AB A former mining site has been the subject of extensive remediation and restoration, with a significant focus on disconnecting mine spoils from groundwater and managing the quantity and quality of runoff. A remaining task is ensuring concentrations of zinc (Zn) in the stream outflow of a pit lake are reduced below water quality standards. The efficacy of multiple capping materials for decreasing Zn dissolution from sediments was conducted under natural and reasonable worst-case conditions (pH = 5.5). Capping materials included AquaBlok (TM), limestone, and limestone-bone char. Field exposures were conducted in limnocorrals that isolated overlying water columns above the sediment and capping treatments. Simultaneous in situ and ex situ toxicity tests were conducted using Daphnia magna, Hyalella azteca, and Chironomus dilutus. In situ caged organisms were protected from temperature shock (warm epilimnetic waters) by deploying within a Toxicity Assessment Container System (TACS). Organisms were exposed to surficial sediments, caps, and hypolimnetic overlying waters for 4 d. Ex situ testing was conducted in core tube mesocosms containing sediments and caps at similar temperatures (15-19 degrees C). Results demonstrated the usefulness of TACS deployment in stratified lake systems. There were no differences in responses between treatments involving sediment capping materials in both in situ and ex situ tests. The lack of differences was likely due to dissolved Zn in surface water being below the hardness-adjusted threshold effects levels (164 mu g L-1). This field- and laboratory-based weight-of-evidence study provided site-specific data to support the selection of an effective remedy, with reduced uncertainty compared to laboratory and chemistry-only approaches.

This technique allows the detection of both direct and indirect relationships among AVS, SEM, and other soil variables, representing results in a graphical view. The dataset included 90 soil samples from 21 different sites belonging to 6 different saltmarshes and featured a wide range of soil chemicophysical properties. Variables included in the a priori model were hydroperiod, pH, soil redox potential, labile organic carbon, carbonates, total iron, and total amount of potentially toxic elements (PTEs). The best optimized model pointed out the main soil properties that affect AVS accumulation and SEM speciation in these soils. Effect plots of AVS and SEM calculated with the partial linear mixed-effects models included in the piecewise structural equation modeling showed a significant and positive influence of pH and carbonates on AVS and a highly significant effect of carbonates and labile organic carbon on SEM. Single SEM components were also considered separately, to define the potential contributions of labile organic carbon or carbonates as alternative binding phases. Simultaneously extracted Cu, Ni, and Zn were preferentially bound to carbonates, followed by labile organic carbon, whereas Pb and Cd were easily bound to labile organic carbon.

AB Manganese (Mn) might stimulate the valve closure reflex in the freshwater bivalve Anodontites trapesialis, leading to metabolic suppression, whereas zinc (Zn) is not able to modify this behavior. To investigate this particular response, we exposed A. trapesialis specimens to Mn (0.5 mg L-1) and Zn (1.0 mg L-1) alone, and to their mixture, to measure further endpoints in different clam tissues: glycogen level in gills, and calcium (Ca2+), sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl-) concentrations in the hemolymph. Furthermore, we used cutting-edge technology, proteomics, to evaluate modifications in protein patterns under the 3 exposure tests. The main results highlighted that only Mn caused a clear drop in glycogen levels in gills, an increase in Ca2+ and Na+, and a simultaneous decrease in Cl- concentration in the hemolymph. The proteomic analysis confirmed that Mn promoted more effects in A. trapesialis than the other tested conditions, because the number of proteins modulated was higher than the results obtained after exposure to Zn and the mixture. Moreover, 11 of the 12 modulated proteins were down-expressed. These results consolidate the hypothesis that Mn might suppress gill metabolic rate in A. trapesialis. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-6.

AB Emissions of plastic waste to the environment and the subsequent degradation into microplastic particles that have the potential to interact with biological organisms represent a concern for global society. Current understanding of the potential impacts on aquatic and terrestrial population stability and ecosystem structure and function associated with emissions of microplastic particles is limited and insufficient to fully assess environmental risks. Multistakeholder discussions can provide an important element in helping to identify and prioritize key knowledge gaps in assessing potential risks. In the present review, we summarize multistakeholder discussions from a 1-d International Council of Chemical Associations-sponsored symposium, which involved 39 scientists from 8 countries with representatives from academia, industry, and government. Participants were asked to consider the following: discuss the scientific merits and limitations of applying a proposed conceptual environmental risk assessment (ERA) framework for microplastic particles and identify and prioritize major research needs in applying ERA tools for microplastic particles. Multistakeholder consensus was obtained with respect to the interpretation of the current state of the science related to effects and exposure to microplastic particles, which implies that it is unlikely that the presence of microplastic in the environment currently represents a risk. However, the quality and quantity of existing data require substantial improvement before conclusions regarding the potential risks and impacts of microplastic particles can be fully assessed. Research that directly addresses the development and application of methods that strengthen the quality of data should thus be given the highest priority. Activities aimed at supporting the development of and access to standardized reference material were identified as a key research need. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2087-2100. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB Azole fungicides have entered the aquatic environment through agricultural and residential runoff. In the present study, we compared the off-target toxicity of tebuconazole, propiconazole, and myclobutanil using embryo-larval zebrafish as a model. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relative toxicity of tebuconazole, propiconazole, and myclobutanil using multiple-level endpoints such as behavioral endpoints and enzymatic and molecular biomarkers associated with their mode of action. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to azoles at environmentally relevant and high concentrations, 0.3, 1.0, and 1000 mu g/L, starting at 5 h postfertilization (hpf) up to 48 hpf, as well as 5 d postfertilization (dpf). Relative mRNA expressions of cytochrome P450 family 51 lanosterol-14 alpha-demethylase, glutathione S-transferase, caspase 9, phosphoprotein p53, and BCL2-associated X protein were measured to assess toxicity attributable to fungicides at the mRNA level, whereas caspase 3/7 (apoptosis) and 3,4-methylene dioxy amphetamine (lipid peroxidation) levels were measured at the enzymatic level. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction was measure through the Mito Stress test using the Seahorse XFe24 at 48 hpf. In addition, light to dark movement behavior was monitored at 5 dpf using Danio Vision (R) to understand adverse effects at the organismal level. There was no significant difference in the light to dark behavior with exposure to azoles compared to controls. The molecular biomarkers indicated that propiconazole and myclobutanil induced lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and potentially apoptosis at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.3 and 1 mu g/L). The results from the mitochondrial respiration assay indicated a slight decrease in spare respiratory capacity with an acute exposure (48 hpf) to all 3 azoles at 1000 mu g/L. Based on the present results, propiconazole and myclobutanil are acutely toxic compared to tebuconazole in aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations.

AB In vitro biotransformation studies were performed to support the bioaccumulation assessment of 3 hydrophobic organic ultraviolet filters (UVFs), 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC), 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC), and octocrylene. In vitro depletion rate constants (k(dep)) were determined for each UVF using rainbow trout liver S9 fractions. Incubations performed with and without added cofactors showed complete (4-MBC) or partial (EHMC and octocrylene) dependence of k(dep) on addition of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), suggesting that hydrolysis of EHMC and octocrylene by NADPH-independent enzymes (e.g., carboxylesterases) is an important metabolic route. The concentration dependence of k(dep) was then evaluated to estimate Michaelis-Menten parameters (K-M and V-max) for each UVF. Measured k(dep) values were then extrapolated to apparent whole-body biotransformation rate constants using an in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) model. Bioconcentration factors (BCFs) calculated from k(dep) values measured at concentrations well below K-M were closer to empirical BCFs than those calculated from k(dep) measured at higher test concentrations. Modeled BCFs were sensitive to in vitro binding assumptions employed in the IVIVE model, highlighting the need for further characterization of chemical binding effects on hepatic clearance. The results suggest that the tested UVFs are unlikely to accumulate to levels exceeding the European Union Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction regulation criterion for bioaccumulative substances (BCF > 2000 L kg(-1)). However, consideration of appropriate in vitro test concentrations and binding correction factors are important when IVIVE methods are used to refine modeled BCFs.

AB Previous studies have suggested that understanding soil metal speciation, rather than relying solely on total metal content, can improve the accuracy and utility of contaminated site risk assessments. Because soil properties and reaction time can alter metal speciation, speciation should influence metal bioaccessibility. For example, under gastrointestinal conditions, it is expected that metal species will differ in bioaccessibility depending on their stability in acidic pH environments. We studied the links between metal speciation and bioaccessibility. A combination of synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) was used to identify the zinc (Zn) speciation in spiked and smelter-affected soils. After conducting in vitro digestion tests on the soil samples, XANES and linear combination fitting were carried out on the residual pellets to identify the species of Zn that remained after digesting the soils in the simulated gastric and duodenal fluids. The metal species that were not present in the residual pellets were inferred to have been dissolved and, thus, more bioaccessible. Sphalerite (ZnS), ZnO, and outer-sphere Zn contributed more to Zn bioaccessibility than franklinite (ZnFe2O4) and Zn incorporated into a hydroxy interlayer mineral (Zn-HIM). The bioaccessibility of Zn-aluminum layered double hydroxides (Zn-Al-LDH) was found to be inversely proportional to its residence time in soil. It was also observed that the relatively high pH of the duodenum favors metal reprecipitation and readsorption, leading to a reduction in bioaccessible metal concentration. These results imply that metal speciation mainly controls metal bioaccessibility. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:448-459. (c) 2018 SETAC.

AB A semifield study to assess the effects of iprodione on honeybees at label use rates was conducted on a bloom mustard crop. The present study followed the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guideline 75 tunnel test and consisted of 3 groups: the iprodione-treated group, the untreated control group, and the toxic reference item group. In addition to the tunnels used for biological assessments, a tunnel was set up in the treatment and control groups to determine the level of residues in flowers, nectar, and pollen. The major endpoints to assess the effects of the application of iprodione were mortality, flight intensity, behavior, condition of the colonies, and development of the brood. Residue analysis showed that honeybees were exposed to significant residues of iprodione. However, no adverse effects were observed on overall mortality, flight intensity, behavior, or brood development of honeybees compared to control. It is concluded that iprodione does not adversely affect the health of honeybees when applied in agriculture at commercially relevant rates in a worst-case exposure scenario.

AB Sediments from the Upper Columbia River, Washington, USA, are contaminated with metals from smelting operations. We conducted short-term and long-term tests with the midge Chironomus dilutus and the amphipod Hyalella azteca and short-term tests with the freshwater mussel Lampsilis siliquoidea with 54 sediments from the Upper Columbia River to characterize thresholds for toxicity of metals to benthic invertebrates. Test sediments were screened for toxicity by comparisons with low-metal reference sediments. Toxic effects on amphipods occurred primarily in sediments from the upstream (riverine) reach, and toxic effects on midges occurred in sediments from both the upstream reach and the downstream (reservoir) reach. Little toxicity was observed in mussel tests. Toxicity thresholds (20% effect concentrations [EC20s]) for metals in sediment and porewater were estimated from logistic concentration-response models. Copper (Cu) concentrations in the simultaneously extracted metal fraction of sediments and bioavailable Cu in porewater, as characterized by biotic ligand models, had consistent associations with toxicity endpoints. Concentration-response models for sediment Cu produced EC20s for 6 endpoints, with long-term amphipod survival and reproduction being the most sensitive. A logistic regression model fitted to an endpoint sensitivity distribution for sediment Cu predicted that approximately one-half of the sediments tested would be toxic to at least one endpoint and that approximately 20% of test sediments would be toxic to more than half of the endpoints. These results indicate that sediments from the upstream reach of the Upper Columbia River, which contain high concentrations of metals associated with slags, cause a wide range of toxic effects in laboratory tests and are likely to have adverse effects on benthic invertebrate communities.

AB Coal mining can cause selenium (Se) contamination in US Appalachian streams, but linkages between water-column Se concentrations and Se bioaccumulation within Appalachian headwater streams have rarely been quantified. Using elevated specific conductance (SC) in stream water as an indicator of mining influence, we evaluated relationships between SC and Se concentrations in macroinvertebrates and examined dynamics of Se bioaccumulation in headwater streams. Twenty-three Appalachian streams were categorized into 3 stream types based on SC measurements: 1) reference streams with no coal-mining history; 2) mining-influenced, high-SC streams; and 3) mining-influenced, low-SC streams. Selenium concentrations in macroinvertebrates exhibited strong positive associations with both SC and dissolved Se concentrations in stream water. At 3 streams of each type, we further collected water, particulate matter (sediment, biofilm, leaf detritus), and macroinvertebrates and analyzed them for Se during 2 seasons. Enrichment, trophic transfer, and bioaccumulation factors were calculated and compared among stream types. Particulate matter and macroinvertebrates in mining-influenced streams accumulated high Se concentrations relative to reference streams. Concentrations were found at levels indicating Se to be a potential environmental stressor to aquatic life. Most Se enrichment, trophic transfer, and bioaccumulation factors were independent of season. Enrichment factors for biofilm and sediments and bioaccumulation factors for macroinvertebrate predators varied negatively with water-column Se. Our results increase scientific understanding of Se bioaccumulation processes in Appalachian headwater streams. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2714-2726. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Uranium (U) mining and milling release arsenic (As), nickel (Ni) and U to receiving waters, which accumulate in sediments. The objective of the present study was to investigate if As, Ni, and U concentrations in tissue residue of Hyalella azteca, overlying water, sediment porewater, and solids could predict juvenile and adult survival and growth in conditions similar to lake sediments downstream of U mines and mills. We conducted 14-d static sediment toxicity tests spiked with U, As, and Ni salts. For U, we spiked uranyl nitrate with sodium bicarbonate to limit U precipitation once in contact with circumneutral sediment. The median lethal concentrations for As, Ni, and U of juveniles and adults based on measured concentrations in sediments were 134 and 165g/g, 370 and 787g/g, and 48 and 214g/g, respectively. Adult survival and growth linearly decreased with increasing bioaccumulation. For juveniles, metal accumulation linearly predicted survival. We calculated median lethal body concentrations for juveniles and adults of 5 and 36g As/g, 14 and 49g Ni/g, and 0.4 and 1.0g U/g. The concentrations of As, Ni, and U in tissue residue leading to a 20% decrease in adult growth were 32gAs/g, 44gNi/g, and 1gU/g. Overall, the present study showed that U was the most toxic element, followed by As and Ni; that juveniles were more sensitive to the 3 metals tested than adults; and that threshold body concentrations can support assessment of benthic invertebrate community impairment.

AB Toxicity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to benthic organisms is a major concern. The use of AgNPs in industry and consumer products leads to increasing release of AgNPs into the aquatic environmentsediments being the major sink. Effects of sediment pH on the toxicity of AgNPs to benthic oligochaeta Lumbriculus variegatus were studied in a 23-d toxicity test. Artificially prepared sediments (pH 5 and 7) were spiked with varying concentrations of uncoated AgNP, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated AgNP, and silver nitrate (AgNO3) as dissolved Ag reference. Number of individuals and biomass change were used as endpoints for the toxicity. The toxic effects were related to the bioaccessible concentration of dissolved Ag in the sediments, assessed with a 2-step extraction procedure. The toxicity of 2 AgNPs was similar and greatly enhanced in the acidic sediment. Because the toxic effects were well related to the bioaccessible concentration of dissolved Ag in the sediments, the toxicity of sediment-associated AgNPs to L. variegatus is suggested to be a function of dissolved Ag rather than a result from NP-specific modes of toxicity.

AB Temporal trends in levels of biomagnifying contaminants, such as mercury (Hg), in top predators can provide insights into changes in contaminant bioavailability through time. However, interpreting contaminant temporal trends in predators can be confounded by temporal changes in their diets, which, in turn, could affect organism trophic position and exposure to biomagnifying contaminants. To address this issue, bulk stable nitrogen isotope analysis, that is, analysis of whole tissue, is widely incorporated into contaminant-monitoring programs for the estimation of organism trophic position. In the present study, we investigated lake-specific temporal trends in Hg levels in herring gull (Larus argentatus smithsonianus) eggs from Lakes Huron and Erie, 2 Laurentian Great Lakes. Levels of Hg in Lake Huron eggs declined, whereas Lake Erie eggs showed no change. Stable nitrogen isotope analysis of bulk material could not explain these interlake differences in Hg temporal trends. However, application of amino acid compound-specific stable nitrogen isotope analysis, in conjunction with other dietary tracers (i.e., fatty acids), provided insights into the factors regulating interlake differences in Hg temporal trends. Adjusting Hg levels in predators to account for temporal changes in their diets can have a significant impact on the interpretation of temporal trend contaminants data. In this case, it reconciled the apparently different Hg temporal trends observed in gull eggs from Lakes Huron and Erie. (C) 2018 SETAC

AB The unique physical and chemical properties of graphene-based nanomaterials (GNMs) have inspired a diverse range of scientific and industrial applications. The market value of GNMs is predicted to reach $US 1.3 billion by 2023. Common to many nanomaterials, an important and unresolved question is the environmental consequences of the increases in GNMs use. The current deficiencies in studies reporting ecotoxicology data for GNMs include differences in analytical methodologies for quantification, no standardized test guidelines, differences in morphology of GNMs, the lack of Chemical Abstract Service numbers, and the quality of the reported data. The assessment of potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms typically relies on guideline values based on species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) of toxicity data. We present preliminary water quality guideline values for graphene oxide NMs in freshwaters. Data include 10 species from 7 phyla (bacteria and fungi were not included). The most sensitive organism was found to be the freshwater shrimp Palaemon pandaliformis. The derived guideline values for 99, 95, 90, and 80% species protection were 350, 600, 830, and 1300g/L, respectively. These results will contribute to the regulatory derivations of future water quality guideline values for graphene-based NMs. (C) 2018 SETAC

AB Some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), components of crude oil, are known to cause increased toxicity when organisms are co-exposed with ultraviolet radiation, resulting in photo-induced toxicity. The photodynamic characteristics of some PAHs are of particular concern to places like Australia with high ultraviolet radiation levels. The objective of the present study was to characterize the photo-induced toxicity of an Australian North West Shelf oil to early life stage yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) and black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri). The fish were exposed to high-energy water accommodated fractions for 24 to 36 h. During the exposure, the fish were either co-exposed to full-intensity or filtered natural sunlight and then transferred to clean water. At 48 h, survival, cardiac effects, and spinal deformities were assessed. Yellowtail kingfish embryos co-exposed to oil and full-spectrum sunlight exhibited decreased hatching success and a higher incidence of cardiac arrhythmias, compared with filtered sunlight. A significant increase in the incidence of pericardial edema occurred in black bream embryos co-exposed to full-spectrum sunlight. These results highlight the need for more studies investigating the effects of PAHs and photo-induced toxicity under environmental conditions relevant to Australia. (C) 2018 SETAC.

We derived extirpation concentrations at the 95th percentile (XC95) of a weighted cumulative frequency distribution for fish species inhabiting streams of the central and southern Appalachians by customizing methods used previously with macroinvertebrate genera. Weighting factors were calculated based on the number of sites in basins where each species occurred, reducing overweighting observations of species restricted to fewer basins. Comparing the species- and genus-level fish XC95 values, XC95s for fish genera were near the XC95s for the most salt-tolerant species in the genus. Therefore, a genus-level effect threshold is not reliably predictive of species-level extirpation, unless the genus is monospecific in the assessed assemblage. Of the 101 fish species XC95 values, 5% were <509 and 10% were <565 mu S/cm. The lowest XC95 for a species was 322 mu S/cm, which is >300 mu S/cm, the exposure estimated to extirpate 5% of macroinvertebrate genera in the central Appalachians. Above 509 mu S/cm, 41 of the 101 species are expected to decline in occurrence. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:871-883. Published 2017 Wiley Periodicals Inc. on behalf of SETAC.

AB Particulate matter with diameter 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) is a serious atmospheric pollutant. Composition and source analyses are essential for controlling PM2.5. Rare earth elements (REEs) have received little attention as a component of PM2.5. In the present study, PM2.5 samples were collected in urban and suburban areas in Xiamen and analyzed for REEs. The concentration range of total REEs (Sigma REE) is 12.07 to 98.45mg/kg, with a mean of 38.53mg/kg, in urban PM2.5 and 16.44 to 160.62mg/kg, with a mean of 42.94mg/kg, in suburban PM2.5. Light REE concentrations are higher in suburban PM2.5, whereas heavy REE concentrations are higher in urban PM2.5, implying distinct sources of REEs in urban and suburban PM2.5. The scatter plots of Eu-Sigma REE and La-Ce-Sm suggest that REEs in urban PM2.5 originate from gasoline- and diesel-vehicle exhaust, whereas those in suburban PM2.5 are mainly influenced by gasoline-vehicle exhaust.

AB Organic contaminants with designed molecular bioactivity, such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals, originate from human and agricultural sources, occur frequently in surface waters, and threaten the structure and function of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Congaree National Park in South Carolina (USA) is a vulnerable park unit due to its location downstream of multiple urban and agricultural contaminant sources and its hydrologic setting, being composed almost entirely of floodplain and aquatic environments. Seventy-two water and sediment samples were collected from 16 sites in Congaree National Park during 2013 to 2015, and analyzed for 199 and 81 targeted organic contaminants, respectively. More than half of these water and sediment analytes were not detected or potentially had natural sources. Pharmaceutical contaminants were detected (49 total) frequently in water throughout Congaree National Park, with higher detection frequencies and concentrations at Congaree and Wateree River sites, downstream from major urban areas. Forty-seven organic wastewater indicator chemicals were detected in water, and 36 were detected in sediment, of which approximately half are distinctly anthropogenic. Endogenous sterols and hormones, which may originate from humans or wildlife, were detected in water and sediment samples throughout Congaree National Park, but synthetic hormones were detected only once, suggesting a comparatively low risk of adverse impacts. Assessment of the biodegradation potentials of 8 C-14-radiolabeled model contaminants indicated poor potentials for some contaminants, particularly under anaerobic sediments conditions.

AB Over the past decade, the field of molecular biology has rapidly incorporated epigenetic studies to evaluate organism-environment interactions that can result in chronic effects. Such responses arise from early life stage stress, the utilization of genetic information over an individual's life time, and transgenerational inheritance. Knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms provides the potential for a comprehensive evaluation of multigenerational and heritable effects from environmental stressors, such as contaminants. Focused studies have provided a greater understanding of how many responses to environmental stressors are driven by epigenetic modifiers. We discuss the promise of epigenetics and suggest future research directions within the field of aquatic toxicology, with a particular focus on the potential for identifying key heritable marks with consequential impacts at the organism and population levels.

AB Oysters accumulate Zn as an adaptation to Zn exposure; however, it is not known whether male and female oysters respond differently to Zn exposure. Proteomic and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses were used to investigate differential responses of male and female oysters (Crassostrea angulata) to Zn exposure. After exposure to 50 mu g L-1 or 500 mu g L-1 Zn for 30 d, gonads of female oysters accumulated more Zn than those of males, and gonadal development was accelerated in females but was abnormal in males. Differentially expressed proteins after exposure to Zn were identified and shown to function in Zn transport, Ca transport, phosphate metabolism, energy metabolism, immune regulation, oxidative stress responses, gene expression regulation, and fat metabolism. Proteins with functions in Zn transportation and storage, and multifunctional proteins, such as hemicentin-1 and histidinol dehydrogenase, were expressed at significantly higher levels in the gonads of female than male oysters after Zn exposure.

AB Using effects-directed analysis, we investigated associations previously observed between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and embryotoxicity in field-deployed low-density polyethylene (LDPE). We conducted effects-directed analysis using a zebrafish embryo assay and iterative fractionation of extracts of LDPE that were deployed in the Portland Harbor superfund megasite, Oregon (USA). Whole extracts induced toxicity including mortality, edema, and notochord distortion at 20% effect concentration (EC20) values of approximately 100, 100, and 10 mg LDPE/mL, respectively. Through fractionation, we determined that PAHs at concentrations similar to previous research did not contribute markedly to toxicity. We also eliminated pesticides, phthalates, musks, and other substances identified in toxic fractions by testing surrogate mixtures. We identified free fatty acids as lethal components of LDPE extracts and confirmed their toxicity with authentic standards. We found chromatographic evidence that dithiocarbamates are responsible for notochord and other sublethal effects, although exact matches were not obtained. Fatty acids and dithiocarbamates were previously unrecorded components of LDPE extracts and likely contribute to the toxicity of the whole mixture. The present study demonstrates the success of effects-directed analysis in nontargeted hazard identification using the zebrafish embryo test as a self-contained battery of bioassays that allows identification of multiple chemicals with different modes of action. This is the first effects-directed analysis to combine LDPE and zebrafish, approaches that are widely applicable to identifying developmental hazards in the bioavailable fraction of hydrophobic organic compounds.

AB Mercury (Hg) is a pollutant of global concern. Sentinel species such as river otter (Lontra canadensis) and mink (Neovison vison) are often used to monitor environmental concentrations in freshwater ecosystems. Tissue total Hg (THg) concentrations are frequently used as biomarkers of exposure. However, there is no comprehensive model relating Hg tissue concentrations in different tissues, making interstudy comparisons challenging. Our objective was to establish conversion factors relating fur, brain, liver, kidney, and muscle THg concentrations using mean concentrations and standard errors reported in the literature. We used data from more than 6000 samples, pooled across 16 studies and 96 sampling sites in North America and Europe. Sixteen regressions were derived for the river otter and mink models, which were statistically significant at a 95% confidence interval and yielded high explained variances. The models were validated using an external data set of individually measured THg tissue concentrations. The validated conversions were used to evaluate the current fur Hg screening guidelines of 20 mu g/g and 30 mu g/g. At both of these fur concentrations, brain concentrations are of concern for altering brain neurochemistry. Wesuggest a more conservative fur Hg screening guideline of 15 mu g/g to protect sensitive furbearers. The conversion factors can be used to predict internal organ THg concentrations from fur measurements, eliminating the need for invasive tissue sampling. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB The recovery of the confined aquatic disposal (CAD) facility located at Malmoykalven in Oslofjord, Norway, has been assessed using an array of field measurement techniques. These methods were used prior to the disposal of dredged sediments as well as during 3 annual postdisposal monitoring campaigns. Traditional sampling to assess chemical recovery indicates that an immediate reduction in total sediment concentrations and surface sediments can be characterized as having good quality. Deposition of new material indicates that the quality of depositing material at the CAD is stabile and representative of the natural background quality in the area. Continued deposition of this material will improve the long-term chemical recovery of the CAD. A positive biological recovery of the benthic community has been observed and is expected to continue along a typical benthic succession pattern. To supplement traditional sampling, passive samplers were deployed at the CAD. Results suggest that the flux and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 16 and polychlorinated biphenyl 7 released from the CAD will continue to decrease over time. The combined results from these multiple lines of evidence indicate that the CAD and capping layer function as predicted 3 yr after the construction was completed. There is not only an improvement in the efficacy of the CAD itself but also a general improvement of the area, compared with the situation prior to disposal. (C) 2017 SETAC

ID ENVIRONMENTAL FATE; DEGRADATION
AB Insensitive munitions are desirable alternatives to historically used formulations, such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), because of their so-called insensitivity to unintended detonation. The insensitive munition IMX-101 is a mixture of 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN), 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO), and nitroguanidine (NQ). Environmental releases of munitions may be from production wastewaters or training; these munitions may be exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. Therefore, it is useful to understand the relative toxicity of IMX-101 and its constituents both before and after photodegradation. The intent of the present study was to generate relative hazard information by exposing the standard ecotoxicological model Ceriodaphnia dubia to each insensitive munition constituent individually and to IMX-101 before and after the exposure solution was irradiated in a UV photoreactor. Without photodegradation, DNAN was more toxic (median lethal concentration [LC50] = 43 mg/L) than the other 2 constituents and it contributed predominantly to the toxicity of IMX-101 (LC50 = 206 mg/L) based on toxic units. Toxicity was observed only at high levels of NQ (LC50 = 1174 mg/L) and pH-adjusted NTO (LC50 = 799 mg/L). The toxicity of IMX-101 is lower than literature-reported TNT toxicity. Photodegradation efficiency was greater at lower insensitive munition concentrations. The observed degradation was greatest for NQ (42-99%), which in turn corresponded to the greatest relative increase in toxicity (100-1000-fold). Modest percent of degradation (4-18%) and increases in phototoxicity (2-100-fold) were observed for NTO and DNAN. Photodegraded NQ products were the predominant source of toxicity of photodegraded IMX-101. Future work involves research to enable analytical and computational confirmation of the specific degradation compounds inducing the observed photoenhanced toxicity.

AB The authors quantified hepatic hydrocarbon-inducible cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) expression, as ethoxyresorufin-Odeethylase (EROD) activity, in wintering harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) captured in Prince William Sound, Alaska (USA), during 2011, 2013, and 2014 (22-25 yr following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill). Average EROD activity was compared between birds from areas oiled by the spill and those from nearby unoiled areas. The present study replicated studies conducted from 1998 to 2009 demonstrating that harlequin ducks using areas oiled in 1989 had elevated EROD activity, indicative of oil exposure, up to 2 decades post spill. In the present study, it was found that average EROD activity during March 2011 was significantly higher in wintering harlequin ducks captured in oiled areas relative to unoiled areas, which the authors interpret to indicate that harlequin ducks continued to be exposed to residual Exxon Valdez oil up to 22 yr after the original spill. However, the 2011 results also indicated reductions in exposure relative to previous years. Average EROD activity in birds from oiled areas was approximately 2 times that in birds from unoiled areas in 2011, compared with observations from 2005 to 2009, in which EROD activity was 3 to 5 times higher in oiled areas. It was also found that average EROD activity during March 2013 and March 2014 was not elevated in wintering harlequin ducks from oiled areas. The authors interpret these findings to indicate that exposure of harlequin ducks to residual Exxon Valdez oil abated within 24 yr after the original spill. The present study finalizes a timeline of exposure, extending over 2 decades, for a bird species thought to be particularly vulnerable to oil contamination in marine environments.

AB Selenium (Se) is a developmental toxicant that is also capable of altering the bioenergetic and endocrine status of adult fish. To date, aquatic ecotoxicological research has predominantly focused on the toxic effects of Se in fish, and minimal information has been published related to amphibians. The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential toxicity associated with chronically elevated dietary Se consumption in adult female amphibians utilizing the model species Xenopus laevis. Adult X. laevis females were fed a diet augmented with L-selenomethionine at measured concentrations of 0.7 mu g Se/g (control), 10.9 mu g Se/g, 30.4 mu g Se/g, or 94.2 mu g Se/g dry mass for 68d, after which they were bred with untreated males. Ovary, egg, liver, muscle, and blood samples were collected from female frogs after completion of the exposure period and subsequent breeding to ascertain Se tissue distribution, muscle and liver triglyceride and glycogen levels, and plasma cortisol concentrations. The concentrations of Se measured in female tissues excluding the liver were significantly increased in proportion with dietary intake. No significant differences were observed among treatment groups with respect to biometric indices, energy stores, or stress response of adult female X. laevis after Se exposure, which suggests that this amphibian species is capable of accumulating substantial quantities of this element in their tissues with no adverse effects on fitness.

AB Nontarget aquatic insects are susceptible to chronic neonicotinoid insecticide exposure during the early stages of development from repeated runoff events and prolonged persistence of these chemicals. Investigations on the chronic toxicity of neonicotinoids to aquatic invertebrates have been limited to a few species and under different laboratory conditions that often preclude direct comparisons of the relative toxicity of different compounds. In the present study, full life-cycle toxicity tests using Chironomus dilutus were performed to compare the toxicity of 3 commonly used neonicotinoids: imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam. Test conditions followed a static-renewal exposure protocol in which lethal and sublethal endpoints were assessed on days 14 and 40. Reduced emergence success, advanced emergence timing, and male-biased sex ratios were sensitive responses to low-level neonicotinoid exposure. The 14-d median lethal concentrations for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam were 1.52g/L, 2.41g/L, and 23.60g/L, respectively. The 40-d median effect concentrations (emergence) for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam were 0.39g/L, 0.28g/L, and 4.13g/L, respectively. Toxic equivalence relative to imidacloprid was estimated through a 3-point response average of equivalencies calculated at 20%, 50%, and 90% lethal and effect concentrations. Relative to imidacloprid (toxic equivalency factor [TEF]=1.0), chronic (lethality) 14-d TEFs for clothianidin and thiamethoxam were 1.05 and 0.14, respectively, and chronic (emergence inhibition) 40-d TEFs were 1.62 and 0.11, respectively. These population-relevant endpoints and TEFs suggest that imidacloprid and clothianidin exert comparable chronic toxicity to C. dilutus, whereas thiamethoxam induced comparable effects only at concentrations an order of magnitude higher. However, the authors caution that under field conditions, thiamethoxam readily degrades to clothianidin, thereby likely enhancing toxicity. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:372-382. (c) 2016 SETAC

AB In the present study, the effects of lead (Pb) uptake and toxicity were investigated in a hydroponic culture using 7 tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) genotypes (Bina 1 [B1], Kutsaga Mammoth 10 [KM10], Nanjing 3 [N3], Kutsaga 35 [K35], Kutsaga E1 [KE1], Cocker 176 [C176], and Kutsaga RK6 [KRK6]) that differed in Pb tolerance. Lead was applied as a solution of Pb nitrate at concentrations of 0M, 10M, 250M, and 500M. After 4 wk of Pb treatment, tissue biomass and photosynthetic parameters were measured and elemental analysis was performed. The results showed decreases in growth and photosynthetic parameters with increases in Pb concentration compared with the control. The least reduction in the recorded physiological parameters was noted in K35, whereas the greatest reduction was observed in N3, which is an obvious indication of genotypic differences. Activities of peroxidase, catalase, and malondialdehyde increased significantly with increases in Pb concentration, with genotypes K35 and N3 showing the least and the greatest reduction, respectively. The results demonstrate the phototoxic nature of Pb on plants, and it can be concluded that in Pb-prone areas genotypes K35 and B1 can be used for cultivation because they can grow efficiently in the presence of high Pb concentrations while restricting Pb uptake in the aboveground parts, as seen by the higher Pb tolerance index.

AB A new mathematical model for analyzing data and predicting the effect of mixtures of toxic substances is presented as a generalized form of the concentration addition model. The proposed method, the generalized concentration addition (GCA) model, can be applied to mixtures with arbitrary strengths of interactions (synergistic or antagonistic). It requires mixture effect data for least 1 exposure concentration of the mixture in which fractions of all components and concentration-response functions for each component are known. The GCA model evaluates the interaction between components by introducing a novel response function, which is independent of the response functions for each individual components, to describe the effect of addition between different components. The GCA method was applied to published mixture toxicity data, and it was found to fit the mixture effect better than both the concentration addition model and the independent action model, the implication being that the proposed approach is widely applicable.

AB Concerns are increasing that pharmaceuticals released into the environment pose a risk to nontarget organism such as fish. The fish plasma model is a read-across approach that uses human therapeutic blood plasma concentrations for estimating likely effects in fish. However, the fish plasma model neglects differences in plasma protein binding between fish and humans. Because binding data for fish plasma are scarce, the binding of 12 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs; acidic, basic, and neutral) to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and human plasma was measured using solid-phase microextraction (SPME). The plasma/water distribution ratios (D-plasma/w) of neutral and basic APIs were similar for trout and human plasma, differing by no more than a factor of 2.7 for a given API. For the acidic APIs, the D-plasma/w values of trout plasma were much lower than for human plasma, by up to a factor of 71 for naproxen. The lower affinity of the acidic APIs to trout plasma compared with human plasma suggests that the bioavailability of these APIs is higher in trout. Read-across approaches like the fish plasma model should account for differences in plasma protein binding to avoid over- or underestimation of effects in fish. For the acidic APIs, the effect ratio of the fish plasma model would increase by a factor of 5 to 60 if the unbound plasma concentrations were used to calculate the effect ratio.

AB Increases in the concentrations of major ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-) in freshwater are a growing concern for ecosystem health. These increases may originate from anthropogenic activities such as road deicing, fracking spills, mining, and fertilizer application and have detrimental effects on freshwater organisms through disturbances in ionoregulation and acid-base balance. The cladoceran Daphnia magna is adapted for active ion uptake and reduction of ion loss to maintain osmotic balance, but alterations in ionic composition of the environmental water are associated with toxicity. In the present study, hemolymph ion concentrations were measured using ion-selective microelectrode techniques. Increases in the hemolymph concentrations of Na+ and K+ correspond to elevations in the concentrations of these ions in ambient water. Water concentrations associated with sustained increases in hemolymph ion concentrations correlate well with median lethal concentration values from previous toxicology studies, indicating that Na+ and K+ concentrations in hemolymph may predict toxicity. When water K+ concentration is increased, a simultaneous increase in water Na+ concentration mitigates the increase in hemolymph K+ concentration, a finding which is consistent with the reported mitigation of K+ toxicity by Na+. When ambient concentrations of K+, Na+, and Cl- are increased, not only is there a rise in hemolymph ion concentration but hemolymph pH is altered and pH regulation appears to be prioritized over regulation of hemolymph Na+, K+, and Cl- in D. magna.

AB There is an intrinsic link between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) accumulated in soils and increased health risk to humans after exposure to contaminated soil via ingestion, inhalation of particulates carrying PAHs, and direct contact with polluted soils. However, the assessment of PAH contamination in most developing countries fails to consider health risk assessment. Therefore, a comprehensive study was conducted to determine the concentration, source, toxicity, and human health risks of 16 PAHs in an urban area in Warri, Delta State, in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The results showed varying contamination levels for PAH in soil samples from all sampling points, with benzo[a]anthracene (BaP; at 338.81 mu g/kg) being the most abundant at all 9 sampling stations. The highest total concentration of PAH was observed at station 5 (1230.98 mu g/kg), which was closest to a flow station. Further comparison with PAH contamination standards showed that soils from stations 1 and 2 were weakly contaminated (<600 mu g/kg), and soil samples from stations 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 were moderately contaminated (<1000 mu g/kg). Soil samples from stations 5 and 8 were observed to be heavily contaminated (>1000 mu g/kg). The BaP estimates for soil samples obtained for stations 3 to 9 were higher than the BaP soil screening value (15 mu g/kg), indicating a carcinogenic potential of soil samples. The results also showed that the incremental lifetime cancer risk estimates for PAH in the soil for adults and children were above the recommended threshold (10(-4)) for ingestion and dermal contact, implying that exposure to contaminated soil could lead to cancers in adults and children. Currently, there are no regional or national standards for PAHs in soil that would indicate an increased likelihood for human exposure and subsequent health issues. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-11.

AB Pharmaceutical contamination of the environment is recognized as a global problem although most research has focused on Europe and North America to date, and there remains a dearth of information for developing countries, including those in Africa. To address this data gap, the occurrence of 37 pharmaceuticals belonging to 19 therapeutic classes was monitored in surface water and effluents in Lagos State, Southwest Nigeria. Samples were collected quarterly between April 2017 and March 2018 from 22 sites, and 26 compounds were detected at least once, many in the mu g/L range. Maximum concentrations for those compounds detected ranged from 75 to 129 mu g L-1, and even mean concentrations for 13 compounds were in the order of mu g L-1. These values are among the highest ever measured globally. Sewage effluent was more important than drug manufacturing waste in polluting rivers, although there are likely to be numerous unregulated sources of effluent being discharged to rivers that require further study, including urban waste collection areas and vacuum trucks that collect effluent. Seasonal trends in the data were complex, with some compounds being found at higher concentrations in the dry season and, conversely, others being greater during the wet period; this variation potentially relates to the variety of pollution sources in the catchment. Pharmaceuticals are indispensable to human health, although their usage and discharge into the aquatic environment may lead to ecological problems and antibiotic resistance. The data we present indicate that pharmaceutical pollution of freshwaters is a serious issue in Nigeria, and management efforts are needed to improve this problem. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-8.

AB The Alberta Oil Sands Region in Canada is home to one of the largest oil bitumen deposits in the world. The North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) is a top predator with a small home range and is sensitive to disturbances; it has been designated as a sentinel species for the potential impacts of the natural resource exploitation on freshwater ecosystems in the Alberta Oil Sands Region. With an increasing interest in noninvasive biomarkers, recent studies suggest that gut microbiota can be used as a potential biomarker of early biological effects on aquatic wildlife. The goal of the present study was to determine the river otter gut microbial structure related to environmental variables characterizing mining activities and metal body burden. We obtained 18 trapped animals from and surrounding the surface mineable area of the Alberta Oil Sands Region. The gut microbial community structure was characterized using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon analyses. Trace metal concentrations in the liver were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Our study revealed that the gut bacteria of river otters in the Alberta Oil Sands Region clustered in 4 groups dominated by Peptostreptococcaceae, Carnobacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Nostocaceae. We show that arsenic, barium, rubidium, liver-body weight ratio, and delta N-15 were associated with each cluster. When comparing affected versus less affected sites, we show that river otter gut bacterial community and structure are significantly related to trophic level of the river otter but not to Alberta Oil Sands Region mining activities. Our study reveals that the gut bacterial dynamics can provide insights into the diet and habitat use of river otters but that more work is needed to use it as a pollution biomarker.

AB The present study accessed the use of diffusive gradients in thin film (DGT) as a surrogate for estimating the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in a freshwater mussel. We coupled DGTs with mussels and deployed them in a constructed wetland. Water quality parameters were measured for a 4-d period on 3 continuous occasions during 12-d trials in the summer and winter; metal speciation was modeled for each occasion. Higher cumulative rainfall and water turbidity during the summer trial resulted in higher particulate metal concentrations compared to the winter trial. Mussel accumulated metals did not correlate with DGT-measured metals but positively correlated with particulate metals in the summer because filtering particulate food mainly contributed to the bioaccumulation. In contrast, the winter trial suggested a positive correlation between metal bioaccumulation and DGT-measured metals because uptake of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from water mainly contributed to the bioaccumulation, and the labile metal species complexed with DOM generally overlapped with DGT-targeted metals. Though Cu has a higher affinity for organic ligands than Zn, the interactions between Cu and Zn in the mixture did not impede their uptake and bioaccumulation. The deployment duration when DGTs and mussels are coupled to compare metal bioavailability should be no less than 12 d so that mussels have enough time to accumulate contaminants from the environmental media. In summary, DGT is a convenient surrogate for biomonitoring, but it may not fit the real environment such as the aquatic system with unstable water chemistries. Geochemical modeling is good at calculating metal speciation but inferior to DGT in predicting bioavailability and mimicking bioaccumulation.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-11. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB The frequency of wildfire is expected to increase with time as a function of climate change. Recent studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that pyrogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can cause greater-than-additive effects inHyalella aztecain the presence of low concentrations of Cu. We hypothesized that freshwater animals inhabiting Cu-contaminated sites, such as those in the vicinity of Cu mines, may be vulnerable to nonadditive toxicity from contaminants released by wildfires. To investigate the interaction between Cu and water conditioned by burnt wood ash (fire extract), we exposedH. aztecafor 14 d to binary mixtures of 225 mg/kg Cu-enriched artificial sediment (225 mg Cu/kg) and a fire extract dilution series (12.5, 25, 50, 75, and 100%). All binary mixtures of Cu-enriched sediment and fire extract resulted in complete mortality with the exception of Cu-enriched sediment + 12.5% fire extract. The combination of Cu-enriched sediment with 12.5% fire extract had a more-than-additive effect on survival and tissue Cu concentration, but there was no reduction in growth or acetylcholinesterase activity compared to the 225 mg/kg Cu-contaminated sediment or fire extract control, respectively. Acetylcholinesterase activity was significantly reduced in amphipods exposed to fire extract, but the presence of Cu did not exacerbate this effect. The results suggest that Cu-contaminated water bodies that receive runoff from wildfires are at risk of enhanced toxicity.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;39:1988-1997. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB There is growing concern over the health of North American birds, with evidence suggesting substantial population declines. Spiders are prominent dietary items for many bird species and mediate the transfer of contaminants to arachnivorous birds that consume them. Few studies have investigated the potential risk the spider exposure pathway poses to these birds because most studies have focused on piscivores. In the present study, we developed new chronic and acute As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, Se, Zn, and MeHg spider-based avian wildlife values (SBAWVs) for multiple adult and nestling birds (primarily passerines) and then used the newly generated SBAWVs to characterize the risk to birds across 2 study areas: 1) 5 reaches in the southern Appalachian Mountains, an area with substantial mercury deposition but minimal anthropogenic impact, and 2) 4 reaches adjacent to the Emory River, an area impacted by the largest fly coal-ash spill in US history. We identified MeHg and Cu, Pb, Se, and Zn as contaminants of potential concern (COPC) at the Appalachian Mountain and Emory River study areas, respectively, based on dietary exposure of aquatic contaminants via riparian spiders. The identification of COPC at both study areas due to dietary spider exposure is notable not only because the spider exposure pathway has largely been uninvestigated at these sites but also because the aquatic systems in both areas have been studied extensively. Significant differences in MeHg concentrations were detected among spider taxa and suggest that the selection of spider taxa can impact risk characterization. These results indicate that the spider exposure pathway is important to consider when assessing potential risk, particularly for passerine birds.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-11. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB The effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been largely explored, but there is still a lack of knowledge on their effects under the predicted changes in temperature as a consequence of climate change. The aim of the present study was to determine how leaf consumption by invertebrate shredders is affected by dietary exposure to AgNPs and AgNO(3)and whether changes in temperature alter such effects. Also, responses of antioxidant enzymes were examined. In microcosms, the invertebrate shredderLimnephilussp. was allowed to feed on alder leaves treated with AgNPs (5, 10, and 25 mg L-1) and AgNO3(1 mg L-1) at 10, 16, and 23 degrees C (6 replicates). After 5 d, the animals were transferred to clean water and allowed to feed on untreated leaves. The higher leaf consumption by the shredder was related to temperature increase and to the contamination of leaves with AgNPs and AgNO3. Results from enzymatic activities demonstrated that AgNP contamination via food induce oxidative and neuronal stress in the shredder: the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase were positively correlated with total Ag accumulated in the animal body. Moreover, glutathioneS-transferase activity was strongly associated with higher temperature (23 degrees C). Overall results indicated that the effects of toxicants on consumption rates and enzymatic activities are modulated by temperature and suggested that increases in temperature changes the AgNP effects on invertebrate shredder performance.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-9.

ID SEDIMENT; PHOSPHATE; NITROGEN; STORAGE; EXPORT; WATER
AB Human activities have increased nutrient loadings to aquatic ecosystems, especially during the past century. During low river flow in late summer and early fall, elevated concentrations of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen are present in the temperate Lower Great Miami River and contribute to its eutrophication. Although wastewater treatment plants are suspected of being major sources of P to the river, riverbed sediment has not been examined as an additional potential source of P. Benthic P fluxes were measured at 11 representative locations along the Lower Great Miami River during 3 sampling campaigns in late summer and early fall of 2015. Benthic fluxes of filtered total P (range, -1.6-12 mg m(-2) d(-1)) were related inversely to filtered total P concentrations in river water (p = 0.002,r = -0.60). This relationship suggests that elevated P in river water inhibits mobilization from sediment, likely by minimizing the concentration gradient between porewater and overlying water. To effectively mitigate long-term effects of legacy P stored in Lower Great Miami River sediments, external sources must continue to be managed and discharges reduced to allow legacy P to be mobilized and flushed from the system. Reducing nutrient loading will help protect water quality in the Lower Great Miami River, in other comparable rivers, and in downstream aquatic habitats.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-9.

AB Singular use of activity assays or staining dyes to assess pathogen agrochemical tolerance can underestimate tolerance if pesticides cause sublethal effects. We exposed Schistosoma mansoni cercariae, the aquatic life stage of this trematode that infects humans, to 4 insecticides at 5 concentrations using a 24-h time-to-death assay. We used Trypan blue dye, which stains dead tissue, and activity assays simultaneously to discriminate dead from live but paralyzed individuals. Whereas cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and dimethoate exposure did not affect cercariae at any ecologically relevant concentrations, methamidophos exposure increased survival of cercariae compared with those in the controls. This was because methamidophos-induced paralysis reduced cercarial activity and thus energy expenditures, extending the lifespan of this short-lived parasite that causes human schistosomiasis. These findings highlight that sublethal effects should be considered when pesticide effects on disease are under investigation. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-8. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB Recent regulatory testing programs have been designed to evaluate whether a chemical has the potential to interact with the endocrine system and could cause adverse effects. Some endocrine pathways are highly conserved among vertebrates, providing a potential to extrapolate data generated for one vertebrate taxonomic group to others (i.e., biological read-across). To assess the potential for biological read-across, we reviewed tools and approaches that support species extrapolation for fish, amphibians, birds, and reptiles. For each of the estrogen, androgen, thyroid, and steroidogenesis (EATS) pathways, we considered the pathway conservation across species and the responses of endocrine-sensitive endpoints. The available data show a high degree of confidence in the conservation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis between fish and mammals and the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis between amphibians and mammals. Comparatively, there is less empirical evidence for the conservation of other EATS pathways between other taxonomic groups, but this may be due to limited data. Although more information on sensitive pathways and endpoints would be useful, current developments in the use of molecular target sequencing similarity tools and thoughtful application of the adverse outcome pathway concept show promise for further advancement of read-across approaches for testing EATS pathways in vertebrate ecological receptors.

AB 2,2 ',3,5 ',6-Pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-95) is an environmental neurotoxicant. There is accumulated evidence that some neurotoxic effects of PCB-95 are caused by increased spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in neurons resulting from modifying ryanodine receptors (RyR) in calcium-releasing channels. However, there are large gaps in explaining brain and other developmental malformations on embryonic PCB-95 exposure. In the present study, we address those deficiencies by studying the toxic effects of PCB-95 using zebrafish as an ontogenetic model. To characterize these effects, zebrafish embryos with intact chorions were exposed to 4 different concentrations of PCB-95 (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 ppm) for 3 consecutive days. The controls were maintained in 0.5 x E2 medium or egg water and in 0.1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/0.5 x E2 medium or egg water. PCB-95-treated groups showed dose-dependent decreases in survival and hatching rates, with increased rates of developmental malformations when compared to controls. These include morphological malformations, brain cell necrosis, and smaller eye sizes at 5 d post fertilization. These data suggest potential mechanisms underlying the abnormal behavior observed in a visual stimulus assay. The present study provides insight into PCB-95-induced developmental toxicity and supports the use of the zebrafish model in understanding the effects of PCB-95 exposure.

AB Various environmental and chemical assessment frameworks including ecological risk assessment and life cycle impact assessment aim at evaluating long-term ecotoxicity effects. Chronic test data are reported under the European Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation for various chemicals. However, chronic data are missing for a large fraction of marketed chemicals, for which acute test results are often available. Utilizing acute data requires robust extrapolation factors across effect endpoints, exposure durations, and species groups. We propose a decision tree based on strict criteria for curating and selecting high-quality aquatic ecotoxicity information available in REACH for organic chemicals, to derive a consistent set of generic and species group-specific extrapolation factors. Where ecotoxicity effect data are not available at all, we alternatively provide extrapolations from octanol-water partitioning coefficients as suitable predictor for chemicals with nonpolar narcosis as mode of action. Extrapolation factors range from 0.2 to 7 and are higher when simultaneously extrapolating across effect endpoints and exposure durations. Our results are consistent with previously reported values, while considering more endpoints, providing species group-specific factors, and characterizing uncertainty. Our proposed decision tree can be adapted to curate information from additional data sources as well as data for other environments, such as sediment ecotoxicity. Our approach and robust extrapolation factors help to increase the substance coverage for characterizing ecotoxicity effects across chemical and environmental assessment frameworks.

AB We describe initial development of microarray-based assays for detecting 4 pyrethroid pesticides (bifenthrin, cypermethrin, esfenvalerate, and permethrin) in water. To facilitate comparison of transcriptional responses with gross apical responses, we estimated concentration-mortality curves for these pyrethroids using flow-through exposures of newly hatched Daphnia magna, Pimephales promelas adults, and 24 h posthatch P. promelas. Median lethal concentration (LC50) estimates were below most reported values, perhaps attributable to the use of flow-through exposures or of measured rather than nominal concentrations. Microarray analysis of whole P. promelas larvae and brains from exposed P. promelas adults showed that assays using either tissue type can detect these pyrethroids at concentrations below LC50 values reported for between 72 and 96% of aquatic species, depending on the pesticide. These estimates are conservative because they correspond to the lowest concentrations tested. This suggests that the simpler and less expensive whole-larval assay provides adequate sensitivity for screening contexts where acute aquatic lethality is observed, but the responsible agent is not known. Gene set analysis (GSA) highlighted several Gene Ontology (GO) terms consistent with known pyrethroid action, but the implications of other GO terms are less clear. Exploration of the sensitivity of results to changes in data processing suggests robustness of the detection assay results, but GSA results were sensitive to methodological variations.

AB The transformation of coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and their impacts on aquatic organisms require further study. The present study investigated the role of aging on the transformation of differently coated AgNPs and their sublethal effects on the freshwater alga Raphidocelis subcapitata. The stability of AgNPs was evaluated over 32 d, and the results indicated that transformation of AgNPs occurred during the incubation; however, coating-specific effects were observed. Fresh AgNPs increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, whereas aged AgNPs induced excessive ROS generation compared with their fresh counterparts. Increased ROS levels caused increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) in treatment groups exposed to both fresh and aged NPs, although LPO was comparatively higher in algae exposed to aged AgNPs. The observed increase in catalase (CAT) activity of algal cells was attributed to early stress responses induced by excessive intracellular ROS generation, and CAT levels were higher in the aged NP treatment groups. In conclusion, AgNPs increased ROS levels and LPO in algae and caused the activation of antioxidant enzymes such as CAT. Overall, the results suggest that aging and coating of AgNPs have major impacts on AgNP transformation in media and their effects on algae. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-12. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Activated carbon-amended bed sediments reduced total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) accumulation in 3 functionally different marine species, sandworms (Alitta virens), hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria), and sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus), during both clean and contaminated ongoing sediment inputs. Mesocosm experiments were conducted for 90 d to evaluate native, field-aged bed sediment PCBs, and ongoing input PCBs added 3 times a week. Simulated in situ remediation applied an activated carbon dose equal to the native organic carbon content that was premixed into the bed sediment for 1 mo. The highest bioaccumulation of native PCBs was in worms that remained in and directly ingested the sediment, whereas the highest bioaccumulation of the input PCBs was in fish that were exposed to the water column. When periodic PCB-contaminated sediment inputs were introduced to the water column, the activated carbon remedy had minimal effect on the input PCBs, whereas the native bed PCBs still dominated bioaccumulation in the control (no activated carbon). Therefore, remediation of only the local bedded sediment in environmental systems with ongoing contaminant inputs may have lower efficacy for fish and other pelagic and epibenthic organisms. While ongoing inputs continue to obscure remedial outcomes at contaminated sediment sites, the present study showed clear effectiveness of activated carbon amendment remediation on native PCBs despite these inputs but no remediation effectiveness for the input-associated PCBs (at least within the present study duration).

AB Baseline variations in trout-perch energy use (growth, gonad size) and energy storage (condition, liver size) were characterized between 2009 and 2015 in 8 reaches of the Athabasca River (AB, Canada), including 2 reaches upstream of the city of Fort McMurray (AB, Canada) and 6 reaches downstream of Fort McMurray among existing oil sands operations. Generalized linear models, used to account for background variation, indicated that fork length, gonad size, and liver size decreased, whereas body weight increased, in relation to river discharge, for both male and female trout-perch. Air temperature was positively correlated with liver size and negatively correlated with gonad size and body weight for females, but only positively correlated with gonad weight for males. These linear models explained approximately 20 to 25% of the variation in adjusted body size, and upward of 80% of the variation in adjusted body weight, liver weight, and gonad weight. Residuals from linear models were used to estimate normal ranges of variation for each of the fish population performance measures. Combined, the models and normal ranges can be used to assess subsequent monitoring data, providing potential triggers for follow-up monitoring activities. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-12.

AB Neonicotinoid insecticides are used extensively in agriculture and, as a consequence, are now detectable in nearby aquatic environments. Few studies have evaluated the effects of neonicotinoids on amphibians in these aquatic environments. In the present study, we examined the effects of 2 commercial formulations of neonicotinoids (active ingredients clothianidin and thiamethoxam) on survival and life-history traits of wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) and northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens). We used artificial pond mesocosms to assess the effects of these neonicotinoids, at nominal concentrations of 2.5 and 250 mu g/L, on amphibian larval development through metamorphosis. We found no differences between controls and neonicotinoid exposure for any of the endpoints assessed for either wood frogs or leopard frogs. The present study suggests that concentrations meeting or exceeding observed levels of clothianidin and thiamethoxam in surface waters will not directly affect metamorphosis in 2 amphibians.

AB There are few studies on nanoplastic that propose quantification of the amount ingested combined with evaluation of the toxic effects on aquatic organisms. We propose 2 methods to quantify the amount of polystyrene nanoplastic (PSNP) ingested by Daphnia magna: fluorescence intensity, where a fluorescent monomer (F) is added to the PSNP and quantified through fluorescence light microscopy, and total aluminum quantification, where PSNP is synthesized with Al2O3 metal-core nanoparticles and used for quantification of the nanoplastic ingested by the organism Daphnia magna using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. In addition, the PSNP was functionalized with palmitic acid to simulate the environmental conditions leading to biological and chemical transformations. Acute and chronic toxicity tests were performed with fluorescent PSNP (PSNP/F) and palmitic acid-functionalized PSNP/F (PSNP/F-PA). The ingestion quantified was higher by factors of 2.8 and 3.0 for PSNP/F-PA and 1.9 and 1.7 for PSNP/F applying the fluorescence intensity and total Al quantifying methods, respectively, when compared to PSNP. These results are consistent with the data obtained in the toxicity tests, which showed an approximately 3 times increase in the adverse effect of PSNP/F-PA on the mobility and reproduction of the organisms. Thus, the strong inhibition of D. magna reproduction caused by PSNP/F-PA in the chronic toxicity tests could be associated with a greater amount of this nanoplastic being ingested by the organisms.

AB Microplastic particles are ubiquitously detected in the environment. Despite intensive public and scientific discussions, their potential to transport contaminants in rivers and oceans under environmental conditions is still under assessment. In the present study we measured sorption isotherms and kinetics in batch experiments using phenanthrene (as a typical hydrophobic wastewater contaminant) and microplastic particles of different sizes and materials. We observed a linear sorption isotherm for polyethylene, in contrast to nonlinear sorption of polyamide and polystyrene, which could be best described by the Freundlich and the Polanyi-Dubinin-Manes isotherms, respectively. We modeled sorption kinetics as a combination of external mass transfer governed by diffusion through an aqueous boundary layer and intraparticle diffusion within the plastic. Which of these processes controls the kinetics depends on the sorption strength, particle size, diffusion coefficients, and time. We used semi-analytical and numerical methods to simulate the coupled mass transfer for both linear and nonlinear sorption. We successfully applied the semi-analytical model to polyethylene and the numerical code to polyamide and polystyrene, reproducing the measured kinetics and obtaining reasonable values for mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion coefficients. Subsequently, we used these coefficients to estimate the transport potential and relevant time scales for microplastic-bound contaminants under environmental conditions.

AB Recent studies have shown that temperature affects chronic nickel (Ni) toxicity to Daphnia magna at the individual (apical) level. However, the effect of temperature on Ni toxicity to D. magna at the population level is unknown. The present study investigated whether the effect of temperature on chronic Ni toxicity to D. magna assessed on apical endpoints can be extrapolated to the population level. The results of the population experiment showed no consistent Ni effects on total D. magna population abundance at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C, although the Ni concentrations tested were previously reported to significantly reduce reproduction in D. magna individuals. This result supports the idea that ecological risk assessment should not extrapolate as such from apical endpoints to the population level. A dynamic energy budget individual-based model (DEB-IBM) was calibrated using apical Ni toxicity data at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C. The goal was to investigate whether the calibrated DEB-IBM would be able to predict the unexpected absence of effects at the population level and to further investigate the effect of temperature on Ni toxicity to a D. magna population. At the population level, the calibrated DEB-IBM correctly predicted the unexpected absence of an effect of Ni on a D. magna population. Detailed analysis of simulation output suggests that the predicted lower Ni sensitivity at the population level occurs because Ni-induced mortality is compensated by reduced starvation (less intraspecific competition). Extrapolated median effective concentration (EC50) values for population density predicted that the effect of temperature on Ni toxicity to D. magna populations was smaller (1.9-fold higher at 25 degrees C than at 15 degrees C) than on Ni toxicity to D. magna apical reproduction (the EC50 is 6.5-fold higher at 25 degrees C than at 15 degrees C). These results show that the DEB-IBM can help to replace population experiments by in silico simulations and to optimize the experimental design of population studies.

AB Anthropogenic contamination in the Antarctic near-shore marine environment is a challenge for environmental managers because of its isolation, high costs associated with monitoring and remediation activities, and the current lack of Antarctic-specific ecotoxicological data. The present study investigated the application of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) with a Chelex-100 binding resin for metal contaminant assessment in Antarctic marine conditions. Diffusion coefficients for cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn), determined at 1 degrees C, ranged between 2.1 and 2.6x10(-6) cm(2)/s and were up to 32% lower than those derived by theoretical calculations. Competition of metals on the DGT binding resin was observed at subsaturation concentrations, reducing the effective capacity for metal uptake by approximately 60%. The lability of the dissolved (0.45 mu m filterable) Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn metal fraction to DGT was generally >90% and unaffected by the presence of the Antarctic marine microalga Phaeocystis antarctica. Both DGT and dissolved metal concentrations gave equivalent mixture toxicity predictions in independent action and concentration addition models to P. antarctica and Cryothecomonas armigera; that is, predictions using DGT-labile concentrations also showed antagonism to P. antarctica, which agrees with previously determined mixture interactivity. The benefits of DGT over traditional sampling techniques (i.e., discrete water sampling) include lower method detection limits (MDLs), in situ assessment, and time-averaged concentrations which capture pulses of contamination typical of the Antarctic near-shore marine environment. The present study provides MDLs and recommended minimum deployment times to guide field deployments in Antarctica. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1323-1333. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB Flexible, rapid, and predictive approaches that do not require the use of large numbers of vertebrate test animals are needed because the chemical universe remains largely untested for potential hazards. Development of robust new approach methodologies and nontesting approaches requires the use of existing information via curated, integrated data sets. The ecological threshold of toxicological concern (ecoTTC) represents one such new approach methodology that can predict a conservative de minimis toxicity value for chemicals with little or no information available. For the creation of an ecoTTC tool, a large, diverse environmental data set was developed from multiple sources, with harmonization, characterization, and information quality assessment steps to ensure that the information could be effectively organized and mined. The resulting EnviroTox database contains 91 217 aquatic toxicity records representing 1563 species and 4016 unique Chemical s Service numbers and is a robust, curated database containing high-quality aquatic toxicity studies that are traceable to the original information source. Chemical-specific information is also linked to each record and includes physico-chemical information, chemical descriptors, and mode of action classifications. Toxicity data are associated with the physico-chemical data, mode of action classifications, and curated taxonomic information for the organisms tested. The EnviroTox platform also includes 3 analysis tools: a predicted-no-effect concentration calculator, an ecoTTC distribution tool, and a chemical toxicity distribution tool. Although the EnviroTox database and tools were originally developed to support ecoTTC analysis and development, they have broader applicability to the field of ecological risk assessment.

AB Increasing oil and gas activities may substantially increase chemical stress to benthic ecosystems in the Arctic, and it is necessary to evaluate such environmental risks in these systems. Risk assessment procedures for oil-related compounds (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]) should address differences in exposure between Arctic and temperate benthos. We compare for the first time the bioaccumulation of PAHs by Arctic benthic invertebrate species with that of temperate species, based on their biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs). Measured PAH BSAFs were generally higher in temperate bivalves (Limecola balthica) than in Arctic bivalves (Macoma calcarea), whereas BSAFs in Arctic polychaetes (Nephtys ciliata) were higher than in temperate polychaetes (Alitta virens). Differences in measured BSAFs were explained by species-specific feeding modes and traits. However, modeled BSAFs revealed that steady state was not likely to be reached in the 28-d tests for all PAHs and organisms. Due to the low numbers of individuals, most species-specific parameters were too uncertain to reveal differences between Arctic and temperate species. The results of the present study suggest that data from temperate species could be used as a surrogate for Arctic species in risk assessment. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:883-895.

AB The production of accurate and reliable data on metal toxicity during ecotoxicological bioassays is important for credible environmental risk assessments and management in aquatic environments. Actual measurements and reporting of contaminant concentrations in bioassays are, however, often disregarded; and potential contaminant loss attributable to adsorption processes (e.g., wall adsorption) in bioassays is widely omitted, which can have detrimental effects on calculated metal toxicity thresholds. In the present we assessed copper (Cu) mass balance during a standard 48-h bioassay test with blue mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) embryos to evaluate effects on calculated toxicity endpoints. We demonstrated that measured Cu concentrations at the test conclusion need to be used to quantify the risk of Cu toxicity because nominal Cu and initial Cu concentrations underestimate overall Cu toxicity by up to 1.5-fold, owing to Cu loss in solution attributable to adsorption and bioaccumulation processes. For the first time we provide evidence that extracellular adsorption to the biological surface of the embryos is the most important sink for total dissolved Cu in a bioassay. We also established that adsorbed extracellular Cu accumulation reduces Cu toxicity to embryos, potentially by inhibiting Cu from entering the cell of the mussel embryo. Environmental factors (e.g., salinity and dissolved organic carbon) did not influence the partitioning of Cu within the laboratory-based bioassay. The present results 1) demonstrate the importance of differentiating extra- and intracellular Cu pools to improve our understanding of Cu toxicity and associated processes, 2) reveal the potential for bias with respect to calculated Cu toxicity thresholds when results are based on nominal and initial Cu concentrations, and 3) point out the need to follow current guidelines for the testing of chemicals to standardize toxicity tests and data reporting.

AB Copper (Cu) nanomaterials have been increasingly researched and produced for many different consumer products. They have high reactivity and bactericidal properties, making them important in antifouling paints, which are thus directly introduced into aquatic ecosystems. However, studies are scarce on the behavior of Cu nanoparticles (Cu-NPs) in natural aquatic systems and their interactions with primary producers such as microalgae. We investigated the effects of NPs on some physiological responses of the freshwater phytoplankton Chlorella sorokiniana. The cells were exposed to nominal concentrations ranging from 2.50 to 635.00 mu g L-1 Cu-NPs for 96 h under laboratory-controlled conditions. The cultures were monitored daily for population growth and maximum photosynthetic quantum yield. Total lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates were quantified at 72 h of Cu-NP exposure. The results showed a positive correlation between nominal Cu-NPs and Cu in the biomass (0.97 correlation coefficient) and that this was inversely proportional to total carbohydrates, with a -0.64 correlation coefficient. At the higher end of the Cu-NP concentrations tested, higher total proteins and reduced growth rates were obtained in comparison with controls; we suggest that metal-binding proteins/antioxidants and nonstructural proteins were preferentially produced under these conditions. Our results contribute to an understanding of the interaction between Cu-NPs and a cosmopolitan phytoplankton, C. sorokiniana, and we emphasize that the disposal and use of Cu-NPs requires monitoring because even at environmentally relevant concentrations, the composition of the algae was affected.

AB We analyzed the effect of pH on Cr(III) accumulation, biomass production, and phenolic profile of Salvinia rotundifolia and Salvinia minima plants grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of CrCl3. Biomass accumulation, metal tolerance index, and photosynthetic pigment contents indicate that Salvinia rotundifolia seems to be more tolerant of Cr(III) than S. minima at different pHs. Increased metal accumulation by Salvinia species under increasing pH could be explained by changes of the protonation status of cell wall functional groups because both the highest and the lowest pH values used in the present study were outside of the levels at which Cr(III) species start to precipitate. The metal translocation factor indicates that in buffered conditions S. rotundifolia tend to retain more Cr(III) in lacinias than S. minima, probably through the involvement of insoluble phenolics. The results of the present study could be useful to the management of solution pH to maximize the removal of Cr(III) by aquatic plants. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:167-176. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), perfluorooctane-sulfonamidoethanols (FOSEs), perfluorooctane-sulfonamides (FOSAs), and other poly- and perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) are common and ubiquitous byproducts of industrial telomerization processes. They can degrade into various perfluorinated carboxylic acids, which are persistent organic contaminants of concern. We assessed the use of polyethylene (PE) passive samplers as a sampling tool for neutral PFAS precursors during field-deployments in air and water. A wide range of neutral PFASs was detected in polyethylene sheets exposed in wastewater treatment effluents in August 2017. Equilibration times for most neutral PFASs were on the order of 1 to 2 wk. Based on known sampling rates, the partitioning constants between polyethylene and water, K-PEw, were derived. Log K-PEw values were mostly in the range of 3 to 4.5, with the greatest values for 8:2 FTOH, 10:2 FTOH, and n-ethyl-FOSE. To test the utility of polyethylene for gas-phase compounds, parallel active and passive sampling was performed in ambient air in Providence (RI, USA) in April 2016. Most PFASs equilibrated within 2 to 7 d. The greatest concentrations in polyethylene samplers were detected for MeFOSE and EtFOSE. Polyethylene/air partitioning constants, log K-PEa, were approximately 7 to 8 for the FTOHs, and approached 9 for n-methyl-FOSA and n-methyl-FOSE. Polyethylene sheets showed promise as a passive sampling approach for neutral PFASs in air and water. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:3002-3010. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Monitoring of benthic invertebrates in streams receiving acidic metal-contaminated water over an 18-yr period revealed both degraded conditions and recovery along a network of downstream locations. Compared with reference streams, and over the course of clean-up remediation efforts below an abandoned open-pit sulfur mine in the central Sierra Nevada of California, improving water quality was accompanied by recovery of benthic communities at some sites. Years of high flow resulted in degraded biological status when acid mine drainage capture was incomplete and metal loading had increased with runoff. Seasonal patterns of recovery evident in the fall after the summer treatment season reverted in the next spring after overwinter periods when sources were not captured. As the metal load has been reduced, phased recovery of community structure, function, and similarity progressed toward that of reference assemblage taxonomic composition. From impacted communities dominated by relatively tolerant midges, reassembly involved an increase in density, return of long-lived taxa, an increased ratio of sensitive-to-tolerant forms, then overall diversity and community composition, and eventually large predators and grazers reappearing along with mayfly, stonefly, and caddisfly richness. Threshold effect levels defined using several analysis methods showed that the response range of biological indicators corresponds to US Environmental Protection Agency guidelines of predicted effects utilizing cumulative criterion units (CCUs) of metal toxicity (i.e., CCU approximate to 1). All sites have shown improved function with increased density of some or all trophic groups over time. Although recovery is progressing, year-around treatment may be necessary to fully restore biological integrity in streams nearest the mine. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2575-2592. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB To find the connections between microcystins and the phytoplankton community, coupled with environmental factors, we investigated 2 cyanobacteria blooming lakes, Lake Taihu (at the center of the Yangtze River Delta, eastern China) and Lake Yanghe (near Qinhuangdao City, northern China). Two years of data, including water quality and the amounts of phytoplankton, microcystins, and the congeners in both algal cells and water, were collected from the 2 lakes during 2013 and 2014. The results showed that both the microcystin quota and release percentage were positively correlated with biodiversity of phytoplankton and the Chlorophyta to phytoplankton ratio, but were negatively correlated with cyanobacteria abundance and the cyanobacteria to phytoplankton ratio; both the microcystin quota and release percentage were closely related to the intensity of competition between cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton; meanwhile, microcystins played a role in the competition between cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton. Salinity had a significantly negative relationship with both cellular and total microcystins, but a significantly positive relationship with the microcystin releasing percentage, indicating that an increase in salinity inhibited the production of microcystins but promoted their release into the aquatic environment. In addition, the average number of microcystins in Lake Yanghe was several times higher than the provisional guideline value adopted by the World Health Organization, indicating a possible health risk to local people.

AB Copper-based algaecides are routinely applied to target noxious algal blooms in freshwaters. Standard toxicity testing data with copper suggest that typical concentrations used to control algae can cause deleterious acute impacts to nontarget organisms. These clean water experiments lack algae, which are specifically targeted in field applications of algaecides and contain competing ligands. The present research measured the influence of algae on algaecide exposure and subsequent response of the nontarget species Daphnia magna to copper sulfate and an ethanolamine-chelated copper algaecide (Captain (R)). Significant shifts (p<0.05) in D. magna 48-h median lethal concentration (LC50) values were found when algae were present in exposures along with a copper salt or a chelated copper formulation. Copper sulfate 48-h LC50 values shifted from 75.3 to 317.8 and 517.8g Cu/L, whereas Captain increased from 353.8 to 414.2 and 588.5gCu/L in no algae, 5x10(5), and 5x10(6) cells/mL algae treatments, respectively. Larger shifts were measured with copper sulfate exposures, although Captain was less toxic to D. magna in all corresponding treatments. Captain was more effective at controlling Scenedesmus dimorphus at most concentrations, and control was inversely proportional to toxicity to D. magna. Overall, incorporating target competing ligands (i.e., algae) into standard toxicity testing is important for accurate risk assessment, and copper formulation can significantly alter algaecidal efficacy and risks to nontarget organisms.

AB Although the paradigm for increased tolerance to pesticides has been by selection on constitutive (naive) traits, recent research has shown it can also occur through phenotypic plasticity. However, the time period in which induction can occur, the duration of induced tolerance, and the influence of multiple induction events remain unknown. We hypothesized that the induction of increased pesticide tolerance is limited to early sensitive periods, the magnitude of induced tolerance depends on the number of exposures, and the retention of induced tolerance depends on the time elapsed after an exposure and the number of exposures. To test these hypotheses, we exposed wood frog tadpoles to either a no-carbaryl control (water) or 0.5mg/L carbaryl at 4 time periods, and later tested their tolerance to carbaryl using time-to-death assays. We discovered that tadpoles induced increased tolerance early and midway but not late in our experiment and their constitutive tolerance increased with age. We found no difference in the magnitude of induced tolerance after a single or 2 exposures. Finally, induced pesticide tolerance was reversed within 6d but was retained only when tadpoles experienced all 4 consecutive exposures. Phenotypic plasticity provides an immediate response for sensitive amphibian larvae to early pesticide exposures and reduces phenotypic mismatches in aquatic environments contaminated by agrochemicals.

AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) continue to receive significant attention, with particular concern for PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), which was a constituent of aqueous film-forming foam used widely as a fire suppressant for aircraft since the 1970s. We were interested in the potential for risk to ecological receptors inhabiting Cooper Bayou, which is adjacent to 2 former fire-training areas at Barksdale Air Force Base (LA, USA). Previous research showed higher PFOS concentrations in surface water and biota from Cooper Bayou compared to reference sites. To estimate risk, we compared surface water concentrations from multiple sites within Cooper Bayou with several PFOS chronic toxicity benchmarks for freshwater aquatic organisms (approximate to 0.4-5.1g PFOS/L) and showed probability of exceedances from 0.04 to 0.5, suggesting a potential for adverse effects in the most contaminated habitats. A tissue-residue assessment similarly showed some exceedance of benchmarks but with a lower probability (maximum=0.17). Both fire-training areas have been inactive for more than a decade, so exposures (and, thus, risks) are expected to decline. Several uncertainties limit confidence in our risk estimates including highly dynamic surface water concentrations and limited chronic toxicity data for relevant species. Also, we have little data concerning organisms higher in the food chain which may receive higher lifetime exposures given the potential for PFOS to bioaccumulate and the longevity of many of these organisms. Overall, the present study suggests that PFOS can occur at concentrations that may cause adverse effects to ecological receptors, although additional, focused research is needed to reduce uncertainties.

AB Fungicides are used to control fungal plant pathogens, but they may also be highly toxic to aquatic fungi, which play an important role in natural aquatic ecosystems. However, a bioassay method using aquatic fungi has not been sufficiently developed. In the present study, a novel, efficient, and ecologically relevant bioassay method was developed for the ecological effect assessment of fungicides. Candidate test species were selected by considering the following 4 factors: 1) their ecological relevance (i.e., widely distributed and frequently observed) in freshwater habitats, 2) inclusion of a wide range of taxonomic groups, 3) availability from public culture collections, and 4) suitability for culture experiments using a microplate. The following 5 fungal species were selected: Rhizophydium brooksiaum (Chitridiomycota), Chytriomyces hyalinus (Chitridiomycota), Tetracladium setigerum (Ascomycota), Sporobolomyces roseus (Basidiomycota), and Aphanomyces stellatus (Oomycota, fungus-like organism). An efficient test method using the 5 species was developed based on a microplate assay using a 96-well white microplate and a test duration of 48h. Fungal biomass was determined as adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) luminescence, which is known to be proportional to live cell density and can be determined with a microplate reader. Test performance was evaluated by conducting bioassays of 3,5-dichlorophenol and malachite green as standard test substances. Fungal species were clearly more sensitive than other species to the fungicide malachite green. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:1980-1989. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB Metal bioaccumulation and oxidative stress biomarkers were determined in Prochilodus lineatus to understand the effects of short-term exposure to a triple-mixture of Zn, Mn, and Fe. Three independent tests were carried out, in which fish were exposed to 3 concentrations of Zn (0.18, 1.0, and 5.0mgL(-1)), Mn (0.1, 0.5, and 5.0mgL(-1)), and in the mix test to Fe (5.0mgL(-1)) and a mixture of Zn (1.0mgL(-1))+Mn (0.5mgL(-1)), with and without Fe. After exposure for 96h, tissues were removed for metal bioaccumulation analysis and oxidative stress biomarkers were determined in liver, along with DNA damage in blood cells. Our results revealed that Zn and Mn were bioaccumulated in fish tissues after exposure to 5.0mgL(-1), whereas Fe only bioaccumulated in muscle and gills after mixture exposure. Results indicated that 1 metal interfered with the other's bioaccumulation. In P. lineatus, 5mgL(-1) of both Mn and Fe were toxic, because damage was observed (lipid peroxidation [LPO] in liver and DNA damage in blood cells), whereas Zn induced liver responses (metallothionein [MT] and reduced glutathione [GSH] increases) to prevent damage. In terms of bioaccumulation and alterations of oxidative stress biomarkers, we showed that Zn, Mn, and Fe triple-mixture enhances individual metal toxicity in Neotropical fish P. lineatus.

AB Barium is present at elevated concentrations in oil and gas produced waters, and there is no international water quality guideline value to assess the potential risk of adverse effects to aquatic biota. Sulfate concentration largely controls the solubility of barium in aquatic systems, with insoluble barium sulfate (barite) assumed to be less bioavailable and less toxic than dissolved barium. We exposed aquatic biota to dissolved barium only and to a mixture of dissolved and precipitated barium. The chronic dissolved barium 48-h growth rate inhibition effect concentrations, (EC10 and EC50) for the tropical freshwater alga Chlorella sp. 12 were 40mg/L (27-54mg/L 95% confidence limits [CL]), and 240mg/L (200-280mg/L 95% CL), respectively. The acute EC10 and EC50 values for 48-h immobilization of the water flea (Ceriodaphnia dubia) by dissolved barium were 14mg/L (13-15mg/L 95% CL) and 17mg/L (16-18mg/L 95% CL), respectively. Chlorella sp. 12 was significantly more sensitive to precipitated barium than to dissolved barium, whereas the opposite seemed likely for C. dubia. Ceriodaphnia dubia was predicted to be chronically sensitive to dissolved barium at concentrations measured in produced waters and receiving waters, based on a predicted chronic EC10 of 1.7mg/L derived from the acute EC50/10. Further chronic toxicity data that account for barium toxicity in dissolved and precipitated forms are required to derive a barium guideline for freshwater biota.

AB In situ amendment of surface sediment with activated carbon is a promising technique for reducing the availability of hydrophobic organic compounds in surface sediment. The present study evaluated the performance of a logistically challenging activated carbon placement in a high-energy hydrodynamic environment adjacent to and beneath a pier in an active military harbor. Measurements conducted preamendment and 10, 21, and 33 months (mo) postamendment using in situ exposures of benthic invertebrates and passive samplers indicated that the targeted 4% (by weight) addition of activated carbon (particle diameter 74 mu m) in the uppermost 10cm of surface sediment reduced polychlorinated biphenyl availability by an average (+/- standard deviation) of 81 +/- 11% in the first 10 mo after amendment. The final monitoring event (33 mo after amendment) indicated an approximate 90 +/- 6% reduction in availability, reflecting a slight increase in performance and showing the stability of the amendment. Benthic invertebrate census and sediment profile imagery did not indicate significant differences in benthic community ecological metrics among the preamendment and 3 postamendment monitoring events, supporting existing scientific literature that this approximate activated carbon dosage level does not significantly impair native benthic invertebrate communities. Recommendations for optimizing typical site-specific assessments of activated carbon performance are also discussed and include quantifying reductions in availability and confirming placement of activated carbon.

AB Many research studies have endeavored to investigate the ecotoxicological hazards of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). However, little is known regarding the actual environmental risks of ENMs, combining both hazard and exposure data. The aim of the present study was to quantify the environmental risks for nano-Al2O3, nano-SiO2, nano iron oxides, nano-CeO2, and quantum dots by comparing the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) with the predicted-no-effect concentrations (PNECs). The PEC values of these 5 ENMs in freshwaters in 2020 for northern Europe and southeastern Europe were taken from a published dynamic probabilistic material flow analysis model. The PNEC values were calculated using probabilistic species sensitivity distribution (SSD). The order of the PNEC values was quantum dots < nano-CeO2 < nano iron oxides < nano-Al2O3 < nano-SiO2. The risks posed by these 5 ENMs were demonstrated to be in the reverse order: nano-Al2O3 > nano-SiO2 > nano iron oxides > nano-CeO2 > quantum dots. However, all risk characterization values are 4 to 8 orders of magnitude lower than 1, and no risk was therefore predicted for any of the investigated ENMs at the estimated release level in 2020. Compared to static models, the dynamic material flow model allowed us to use PEC values based on a more complex parameterization, considering a dynamic input over time and time-dependent release of ENMs. The probabilistic SSD approach makes it possible to include all available data to estimate hazards of ENMs by considering the whole range of variability between studies and material types. The risk-assessment approach is therefore able to handle the uncertainty and variability associated with the collected data. The results of the present study provide a scientific foundation for risk-based regulatory decisions of the investigated ENMs. (C) 2018 SETAC.

AB Since the detection of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in various environmental media, research has explored the potential uptake and toxicity of these chemicals to species inhabiting these matrices. Specifically, pharmaceuticals, including the antiepileptic API carbamazepine (CBZ), are taken up from soil by a range of plants. Many short-term studies have also suggested that certain APIs induce toxicity in plants. However, the effects of APIs on fruiting plants remain relatively unexplored. The present study investigated the uptake, bioaccumulation, and toxicity of CBZ in Cucurbita pepo (zucchini) from seed to full maturity across a range of CBZ exposure concentrations in soil (0.1-20mg/kg). Results of biomass, chlorophyll, starch and total nitrogen (N) concentration in C. pepo indicated toxicity at soil concentrations of >= 10mg/kg. There were clear visual indications of increasing toxicity on leaves, including chlorosis and necrosis, from soil concentrations of 1 up to 20mg/kg. The present study also revealed novel insights into the effect of CBZ accumulation on C. pepo fruiting: female C. pepo flowers were unable to set fruit when leaf concentrations were >= 14mg/kg. These findings may have implications for future agricultural productivity in areas where reclaimed wastewater containing APIs is a source of irrigation. Detectable CBZ concentrations were found in edible C. pepo fruit, indicating the possibility of trophic transfer. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB The development of environmental guidelines in the Antarctic and subantarctic is essential, because expansion of research, tourism, and fishing is placing these regions at increasing risk of contamination. Data are currently insufficient to create the region-specific guidelines needed for the unique conditions in these areas. To develop the most appropriate environmental guidelines, data from the most sensitive life stages of a species should be included to ensure effective protection throughout its life cycle. It is generally accepted that early life stages are more sensitive to contaminants. We compared the toxicity of copper between juvenile and adult life stages of 4 subantarctic marine invertebrates using sublethal and lethal endpoints. For 2 of the species tested, juveniles were more sensitive than adults. (The 7-d median effect concentration [EC50] values for the gastropod Laevilittorina caliginosa were 79g/L at the juvenile stage and 125g/L at the adult; for the flatworm Obrimoposthia ohlini, values were 190g/L at the juvenile stage and 300g/L at the adult.) For the isopod Limnoria stephenseni, juveniles were either more sensitive or of equal sensitivity to adults (7-d EC50 values: juvenile 278g/L and adult 320g/L). In contrast, for the bivalve Gaimardia trapesina, adults appeared to be more sensitive than young adults (7-d EC50 values: juvenile 23g/L and adult <10-20g/L). Although no consistent trend in the sensitivity of life history stages was observed, the present study contributes important information for the development of water quality guidelines in polar regions.

AB The intensive drilling and extraction of fossil fuels in the Gulf of Mexico result in a considerable risk of oil spills impacting its coastal ecosystems. Impacts are more likely to be far-reaching if the oil affects ecosystem engineers like fiddler crabs, whose activities modify biogeochemical processes in the sediment. The present study investigated effects of oil on the fiddler crabs Uca longisignalis and Uca panacea, which are important as ecosystem engineers and as prey for a wide variety of species. The present study used mesocosms and microcosms to investigate the effects of crude oil on fiddler crab burrowing and to assess cellular and tissue damage by the oil. Fiddler crabs were exposed for periods of 5 or 10 d to oil concentrations up to 55 mg/cm(2) on the sediment surface. Their burrowing was delayed, their burrows were smaller, and they transported less sediment in the presence of oil. The hepatopancreas had elevated levels of oxidative stress and a higher abundance of blister cells, which play a role in secretory processes. Interspecific differences were observed; most effects were strongest in U. panacea, though burrowing was more strongly affected in U. longisignalis. The present study demonstrates that crude oil is likely to impact fiddler crabs and many species that depend on them for their diet or for the ecological changes that result from their burrowing.

AB We exposed Blanchard's cricket frogs (Acris blanchardi) to ecologically relevant concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, and 10 mu g/L) of a commercial formulation of atrazine throughout the larval period to determine effects on survival, somatic growth and development (time to metamorphosis and mass at metamorphosis), and gonadal development (sex ratio at metamorphosis and the prevalence of testicular ova in phenotypic males). We tested the following hypotheses: 1) atrazine feminizes the sex ratio, 2) atrazine increases the proportion of phenotypic males with testicular ova, and 3) atrazine differentially affects somatic growth (mass at metamorphosis) and development (time to metamorphosis) for males and females. Although the control sex ratio wasmale-biased, exposure to 0.1 and 10 mu g/L atrazine feminized sex ratios, because these treatments produced 51 and 55% fewer males than the control, respectively. We did not observe testicular ova. Atrazine did not impact survival or metamorphosis, and we did not detect sexually dimorphic impacts on time to metamorphosis or mass at metamorphosis. However, males metamorphosed 2.3 d later than females, regardless of treatment. Sex biases in timing of metamorphosis are underexplored in anurans, but if prevalent, could have important implications for theory surrounding the impact of environmental factors on metamorphosis. Our data suggest that cricket frog sex ratios are sensitive to environmentally relevant concentrations of atrazine and that feminization in the field is likely. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Although conventional wastewater treatment technologies are effective at removing many contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from municipal wastewater, some contaminants are not removed efficiently. Ozonation may be a treatment option for reducing the concentrations of recalcitrant CECs in wastewater, but this process may generate toxic transformation products. In the present study, we conducted semibatch experiments to ozonate municipal wastewater effluent spiked with 5 commonly detected CECs. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether ozonation increased or decreased biological responses indicative of sublethal toxicity in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with extracts prepared from ozonated and nonozonated wastewater effluent. Blood, liver, and brain tissues were collected from the fish at 72 h post injection for analysis of a battery of biomarkers. In fish i.p. injected with the extracts from nonozonated wastewater effluent, significant induction of plasma vitellogenin (VTG) was observed, but ozonation of the municipal wastewater effluent spiked with CECs significantly reduced this estrogenic response. However, in fish injected with extracts from spiked municipal wastewater effluent after ozonation, the balance of hepatic glutathione in its oxidized (glutathione disulfide [ GSSG]) form was altered, indicating oxidative stress. Levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin were significantly elevated in brain tissue from trout injected with the extracts from ozonated spiked municipal wastewater effluent, a biological response that has not been previously reported in fish. Other in vivo biomarkers showed no significant changes across treatments. These results indicate that ozonation reduces the estrogenicity of wastewater, but may increase other sublethal responses. The increase in biomarker responses after ozonation may be because of the formation of biologically active products of transformation of CECs, but further work is needed to confirm this conclusion.

AB Benzotriazole ultra violet stabilizers (BZT-UVs) are compounds used in many applications and products to prevent photochemical degradation. Despite their widespread presence in aquatic ecosystems and persistence in the environment, there are very limited data on their effects and toxicity, and their modes of action remain largely unknown. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the chronic effects of 2 BZT-UVs, 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-bis(1-methyl-1-phenylethyl)phenol (UV-234) and 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-di-tert-pentylphenol (UV-328), on the freshwater green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna. Organisms were exposed to 0.01 and 10g/L of UV-234, UV-328, as well as a mixture of the 2 compounds. Life-history endpoints (viability, reproduction, and growth) and oxidative stress-related biomarkers (gene transcription, reactive oxygen species [ROS] production, and lipid peroxidation) were measured. Daphnia magna growth, reproduction, and gene transcription were not impacted by 21-d individual or mixed exposure. After 96-h of exposure, no differences were observed on the cellular viability of C. reinhardtii for either of the 2 BZT-UVs. In the algae, results showed increased ROS production in response to UV-328 and lipid peroxidation following exposure to UV-234. Synergistic effects of the 2 BZT-UVs were evident at the transcriptional level with 2 to 6 times up-regulation of glutathione peroxidase (gp(x)) in response to the mixture for all treatment conditions. The transcription of superoxide dismutase (sod), catalase (cat), and ascorbic peroxidase (apx) was also regulated by UV-234 and UV-328 in the green algae, most likely as a result of ROS production and lipid peroxidation. Results from the present study suggest potential impacts of UV-234 and UV-328 exposure on the antioxidant defense system in C. reinhardtii. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3333-3342.

AB Across the circumpolar world, intensive anthropogenic activities in the southern reaches of many large, northward-flowing rivers can cause sediment contamination in the downstream depositional environment. The influence of ice cover on concentrations of inorganic contaminants in bed sediment (i.e., sediment quality) is unknown in these rivers, where winter is the dominant season. A geomorphic response unit approach was used to select hydraulically diverse sampling sites across a northern test-case system, the Slave River and delta (Northwest Territories, Canada). Surface sediment samples (top 1cm) were collected from 6 predefined geomorphic response units (12 sites) to assess the relationships between bed sediment physicochemistry (particle size distribution and total organic carbon content) and trace element content (mercury and 18 other trace elements) during open-water conditions. A subset of sites was resampled under-ice to assess the influence of season on these relationships and on total trace element content. Concentrations of the majority of trace elements were strongly correlated with percent fines and proxies for grain size (aluminum and iron), with similar trace element grain size/grain size proxy relationships between seasons. However, finer materials were deposited under ice with associated increases in sediment total organic carbon content and the concentrations of most trace elements investigated. The geomorphic response unit approach was effective at identifying diverse hydrological environments for sampling prior to field operations. Our data demonstrate the need for under-ice sampling to confirm year-round consistency in trace element-geochemical relationships in fluvial systems and to define the upper extremes of these relationships. Whether contaminated or not, under-ice bed sediment can represent a worst-case scenario in terms of trace element concentrations and exposure for sediment-associated organisms in northern fluvial systems.

AB Herbicide drift may have unintended impacts on native vegetation, adversely affecting individual species and plant communities. To determine the potential ecological effects of herbicide drift, small plant community plots were constructed using 9 perennial species found in different Willamette Valley (OR, USA) grassland habitats. Studies were conducted at 2 Oregon State University (Corvallis, OR, USA) farms in 2 separate years, with single and combined treatments of 0.01 to 0.2 x field application rates (f.a.r.) of 1119 g ha(-1) for glyphosate (active ingredient [a.i.] of 830 g ha(-1) acid glyphosate) and 560 g ha(-1) a.i. for dicamba. Plant responses were percentage of cover, number of reproductive structures, mature and immature seed production, and vegetative biomass. Herbicide effects differed with species, year, and, to a lesser extent, farm. Generally, 0.1 to 0.2 x f.a.r. of the herbicides were required to affect reproduction in Camassia leichtlinii, Elymus glaucus, Eriophyllum lanatum, Festuca idahoensis, Iris tenax, and Prunella vulgaris. Eriophyllum lanatum also had a significant increase in percentage of immature seed dry weight with 0.01 x f.a.r. of dicamba or the combination of glyphosate plus dicamba. Other species showed similar trends, but fewer significant responses. These studies indicated potential effects of low levels of herbicides on reproduction of native plants, and demonstrated a protocol whereby species growing in a constructed plant community can be evaluated for ecological responses.

AB Understanding the effects of fungicides on nontarget organisms at realistic concentrations and exposure durations is vital for determining potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Environmental concentrations of the fungicide azoxystrobin have been reported up to 4.6 mu g/L in the United States and 30 mu g/L in Europe. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the chronic toxicity of azoxystrobin in water-only exposures with an amphipod (Hyalella azteca; 42-d exposure), a midge (Chironomus dilutus; 50-d exposure), a cladoceran (Ceriodaphnia dubia; 7-d exposure), and a unionid mussel (Lampsilis siliquoidea; 28-d exposure) at environmentally relevant concentrations. The potential photo-enhanced toxicity of azoxystrobin accumulated by C. dubia and L. siliquoidea following chronic exposures to azoxystrobin was also evaluated. The 20% effect concentrations (EC20s) based on the most sensitive endpoint were 4.2 mu g/L for H. azteca reproduction, 12 mu g/L for C. dubia reproduction and C. dilutus emergence, and >28 mu g/L for L. siliquoidea. Hyalella azteca was more sensitive to azoxystrobin compared with the other 3 species in the chronic exposures. No photo-enhanced toxicity was observed for either C. dubia or L. siliquoidea exposed to ultraviolet light in control water following azoxystrobin tests. The results of the present study indicate chronic effects of azoxystrobin on 3 of 4 invertebrates tested at environmentally relevant concentrations. The changes noted in biomass and reproduction have the potential to alter the rate of ecological processes driven by aquatic invertebrates. Published 2017 Wiley Periodicals Inc. on behalf of SETAC.

AB Increased variability in lake and river water levels associated with changing climate could impact the fate and effects of metals in redox-sensitive sediments through the alteration of microbial communities and of acid-base and redox chemistry. The objective of the present study was to determine the influence of water level fluctuation on metal speciation in porewater and predict environmental risk to high-carbonate systems. Using experimental microcosms with sediments collected from 4 metal-contaminated coastal freshwater wetlands in Michigan, USA, we conducted water level fluctuation experiments. Porewater and sediment metals (Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn) and important metal binding phases (iron-oxide speciation, acid-volatile sulfide) were quantified. In a short-term drying (seiche) experiment, there were decreases in all porewater metals after inundation of saturated sediments. During a drought experiment, reinundation of oxidized sediments increased porewater Cu, Zn, Mg, Ca for most sites. Porewater Zn increased after inundation to levels exceeding the US Environmental Protection Agency threshold for chronic toxicity. These data show that the dissolution of metal carbonates and metal sulfates contributes to metal release after re-flooding and indicate that we might expect increased ecological risk to organisms present in drought-sensitive regions where altered hydroperiods are likely to increase metal bioavailability.

AB A new polymeric biocide polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG) molybdate has been synthesized. The obtained cationic polymer has limited water solubility of 0.015 g/100mL and is insoluble in paint solvents. The results of acute toxicity studies indicate moderate toxicity of PHMG molybdate, which has a median lethal dose at 48 h of 0.7 mg/L for Daphnia magna and at 96 h of 17 mg/L for Danio rerio (zebrafish) freshwater model organisms. Commercial ship paint was then modified by the addition of a low concentration of polymeric biocide 5% (w/w). The painted steel panels were kept in Dnipro River water for the evaluation of the dynamics of fouling biomass. After 129-d exposure, Bryozoa dominated in biofouling of tested substrates, forming 86% (649 g/m(2)) of the total biomass on control panel surfaces. However, considerably lower Bryozoa fouling biomass (15 g/m(2)) was detected for coatings containing PHMG molybdate. Dreissenidae mollusks were found to form 88% (2182 g/m(2)) of the fouling biomass on the control substrates after 228 d of exposure, whereas coatings containing PHMG molybdate showed a much lower biomass value of 23.6 g/m(2). The leaching rate of PHMG molybdate in water was found to be similar to rates for conventional booster biocides ranging from 5.7 mg/cm(2)/d at the initial stage to 2.2mg/cm(2)/d at steady state.

AB Ionic liquids are a group of chemical compounds with chemical properties that are of great interest to various fields of science and industry. However, commercial use of these substances raises concern because they may threaten the natural ecosystems. The present study used 2 types of (-)-menthol-containing imidazolium chiral ionic liquids: 1-[(1R,2S,5R)-(-)-menthoxymethyl]-3-methylimida-zolium hexafluorophosphate [Im-Men][PF6] and 1-[(1R,2S,5R)-(-)-menthoxymethyl]-3-methylimidazolium trifluoroacetate [Im-Men] [CF3CO2]. The effects of these compounds on growth and development of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare) and common radish (Raphanus sativus L. subvar. radicula Pers.) were investigated. The present study demonstrated that chiral ionic liquids produced a relatively high phytotoxicity, by shortening the plants' lengths and roots, thus causing a decline in the experimental plants' fresh weights. The investigated ionic liquids also led to a reduction in photosynthetic pigment levels, changes in hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde content, and changes in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase in both plants. Changes in these enzymes were used to indicate oxidative stress levels in spring barley and common radish. It was demonstrated that imidazolium ionic liquid-induced phytotoxicity depended largely on the type of anion. The liquid [Im-Men][PF6] exhibited higher toxicity toward spring barley and common radish seedlings. Common radish was more resistant to chiral ionic liquids.

AB The use of carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs) such as multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), graphene, and graphene oxide (GO) is increasing across many applications because of their unique and versatile properties. These CNMs may enter the aquatic environment through many pathways, creating the potential for organism exposure. The present study addresses the bioaccumulation and toxicity seen in Daphnia magna exposed to CNMs dispersed in sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS). In study I, D. magna were exposed to varying outer diameters of MWCNTs for 24 h in moderately hard or hard freshwater. Bioaccumulation of MWCNT was found in all treatments, with the highest concentrations (0.53 +/- 0.27 mu g/g) in D. magna exposed in hard freshwater (p< 0.005). The median lethal concentration (LC50) was determined for D. magna exposed to CNMs in moderately hard and hard freshwater. In study II, D. magna were exposed to CNMs for 72 h in moderately hard freshwater to assess swimming velocity and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) detected by dichlorofluorescein fluorescence. An overall decrease was seen in D. magna swimming velocity after exposure to CNMs. The generation of ROS was significantly higher (1.54 +/- 0.38 dichlorofluorescein mM/mg dry wt) in D. magna exposed to MWCNTs of smaller outer diameters than in controls after 72 h (p<0.05). These results suggest that further investigation of CNM toxicity and behavior in the aquatic environment is needed. (C) 2017 SETAC.

AB Herbicides are often detected in watersheds at concentrations that are toxic to phytoplankton, potentially causing indirect effects on higher trophic organisms. The long-term effects of 5 applications over 30 d of binary mixtures of the herbicides diuron and hexazinone were assessed at "low" and "high" concentrations typically found in the environment, using mesocosms. Sixteen of 95 phytoplankton taxa, 3 of 18 zooplankton taxa, and 6 of 14 macroinvertebrate taxa responded negatively to contaminant exposures. Herbicide applications altered the phytoplankton community structure. Relative abundance of Cyanophyceae decreased following 5 applications from 52.1% in the control to 37.3% in the low treatment and to 25.9% in the high treatment, while Chlorophyceae increased to 50.6% in the low treatment and to 61.7% in the high treatment compared with the control (39.7%). Chlorophyceae had the greatest number of affected species ( 8), whereas 1 species within the Cyanophyceae was negatively affected on more than 1 sampling day. Further, chlorophyll a was reduced on 4 and 5 d out of the 8 total sampling days in the low and high treatments, respectively, compared with the control. These results highlight that integrating multiple taxa and contaminants with long-term exposures in ecological risk assessments of herbicides can facilitate the ability to make predictive and mechanistic generalizations about the role of herbicides in shaping patterns of species abundance in natural systems.

AB Intraspecific variability in contaminant sensitivity could undermine risk assessments for nontarget organisms such as amphibians. To test how amphibian populations vary in tolerance to anticipated lethal and sublethal exposures to a pesticide, we exposed Blanchard's cricket frogs (Acris blanchardi) from 3 populations across a broad portion of their range to the insecticide malathion. Exposure in mesocosms to a nominal concentration of 1 mg/L (measured concentrations at 1 h and 24 h postaddition of 0.160 mg/L and 0.062 mg/L, respectively), a realistic direct-overspray scenario, reduced survival to metamorphosis by 43% relative to controls and revealed variation in tolerance among populations. Survival ranged from 74% for the most tolerant population to 18% for the least tolerant population, a 4.1-fold difference. Mass at metamorphosis and time to metamorphosis were unaffected. Although malathion reduced zooplankton abundance, it did not alter food resources (periphyton or phytoplankton relative abundance), or a suite of water-quality variables (pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen). A 96-h time-to-death assay designed to isolate direct, lethal effects also revealed variation in tolerance among populations. Time to death (mean +/- standard error) ranged from 2.4 +/- 0.18 h for the least tolerant population to 17.8 +/- 4.72 h for the most tolerant population, a 7.4-fold difference. However, relative sensitivities of populations differed in the mesocosm and laboratory studies, which differed in exposure concentrations, suggesting that populations tolerant of high concentrations can be more sensitive to lower concentrations. We suggest that direct overspray could reduce larval survival in the field for this species. Studies assessing the role of contaminants in declines or extrapolating to untested populations, especially across large geographical regions, should quantify the range of intraspecific variation. Risk assessors could address intraspecific variability directly by using an intraspecific uncertainty factor. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Few studies have considered the effect of temperature on the chronic sensitivity of Daphnia magna to other stressors. The present study investigated the effect of temperature on chronic metal toxicity and whether this effect differed among 4 different D. magna clones. Life table experiments were performed with copper, zinc, and nickel at 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 25 degrees C. General linear modeling indicated that chronic Cu, Zn, and Ni toxicity to D. magna were all significantly affected by temperature. When averaged across clones, our results suggest that chronic metal toxicity to D. magna was higher at 15 degrees C than at 20 degrees C, which is the temperature used in standard toxicity tests. At 15 degrees C, the 21-d median effect concentrations (EC50s) of Cu, Zn, and Ni were 1.4 times, 1.1 times, and 1.3 times lower than at 20 degrees C, respectively. At 25 degrees C, chronic Cu and Zn toxicity did not change in comparison with 20 degrees C, but chronic Ni toxicity was lower (21-d EC50 of nickel at 25 degrees C was 1.6 times higher than at 20 degrees C). The same trends were observed for Cu and Ni when the 21-d 10% and 20% effect concentrations were considered as the effect estimator, but not for Zn, which warns against extrapolating temperature effects on chemical toxicity across effect sizes. Overall, however, chronic metal toxicity was generally highest at the lowest temperature investigated (15 degrees C), which is in contrast with the usually observed higher acute metal toxicity at higher temperatures. Furthermore, the effect of temperature on chronic Ni toxicity depended significantly on the clone. This warns against extrapolating results about effect of temperature on chemical toxicity from single clone studies to the population level. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the Natural Resource Trustees implemented a toxicity testing program that included 4 different Deepwater Horizon oils that ranged from fresh to weathered, and 3 different oil-in-water preparation methods (including one that used the chemical dispersant Corexit 9500) to prepare a total of 12 chemically unique water accommodated fractions (WAFs). We determined how the different WAF preparation methods, WAF concentrations, and oil types influenced the chemical composition and concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the dissolved and particulate phases over time periods used in standard toxicity tests. In WAFs prepared with the same starting oil and oil-to-water ratio, the composition and concentration of the dissolved fractions were similar across all preparation methods. However, these similarities diverged when dilutions of the 3 WAF methods were compared. In WAFs containing oil droplets, we found that the dissolved phase was a small fraction of the total PAH concentration for the high-concentration stock WAFs; however, the dissolved phase became the dominant fraction when it was diluted to lower concentrations. Furthermore, decreases in concentration over time were mainly related to surfacing of the larger oil droplets. The initial mean diameters of the droplets were approximately 5 to 10 mu m, with a few droplets larger than 30 mu m. After 96 h, the mean droplet size decreased to 3 to 5 mu m, with generally all droplets larger than 10 mu m resurfacing. These data provide a detailed assessment of the concentration and form (dissolved vs particulate) of the PAHs in our WAF exposures, measurements that are important for determining the effects of oil on aquatic species.

AB Mercury (Hg) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant and potent neurotoxin, which may be transformed by bacteria in aquatic ecosystems to methylmercury (MeHg), an organic form which bioaccumulates and biomagnifies. Consequently, long-lived organisms at the top of the food web are at risk of dietary MeHg exposure, which can be actively transferred from mother to offspring. Exposure during neurodevelopment can lead to serious, irreversible neurological dysfunction, associated with a variety of cognitive and motor abnormalities. At low dietary concentrations, MeHg exposure has been associated with deficits in attention and hyperactivity in multiple species. Pathways associated with cognitive function and motor activity are primarily associated with the dopaminergic system. The present study used a model fish species, Pimephales promelas, to examine the effects of MeHg exposure on dopamine concentrations and monoamine oxidase activity in embryos and adult brains. Adult fatheads were exposed for 30d to either a control or a treated diet (0.72ppm Hg). Embryonic and larval exposures were a result of maternal transfer of dietary MeHg. The authors confirmed hyperactive behaviors in embryos and detected significant changes in embryonic dopamine concentrations. Similar effects on dopamine concentrations were seen in the telencephalon of adult brains. Exposure to MeHg also corresponded with a significant decrease in monoamine oxidase activity in both embryos and brain tissue. Collectively, these results suggest that current exposure scenarios in North America are sufficient to induce alterations to this highly conserved neurochemical pathway in offspring, which may have adverse effects on fish behavior and cognition.
