AB Disinfectant quaternary ammonium compounds (Quats) have diverse uses in a variety of consumer and commercial products, particularly cleaning products. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, they have become a primary tool to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces. Disinfectant Quats have very low vapor pressure, and following the use phase of the products in which they are found, disposal is typically "down-thedrain" to wastewater treatment systems. Consequently, the potential for the greatest environmental effect is to the aquatic environment, from treated effluent, and potentially to soils, which might be amended with wastewater biosolids. Among the earliest used and still common disinfectant Quats are the alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (ADBAC) compounds and the dialkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC) compounds. They are cationic surfactants often found in consumer and commercial surface cleaners. Because of their biocidal properties, disinfectant Quats are heavily regulated for human and environmental safety around the world. Consequently, there is a robust database of information regarding the ecological hazards and environmental fate of ADBAC and DDAC; however, some of the data presented are from unpublished studies that have been submitted to and reviewed by regulatory agencies (i.e., EPA and European Chemicals Agency) to support antimicrobial product registration. We summarize the available environmental fate data and the acute and chronic aquatic ecotoxicity data for freshwater species, including algae, invertebrates, fish, and plants using peerreviewed literature and unpublished data submitted to and summarized by regulatory agencies. The lower limit of the range of the ecotoxicity data for disinfectant Quats tends to be lower than that for other surface active agents, such as nonionic or anionic surfactants. However, ecotoxicity is mitigated by environmental fate characteristics, the data for which we also summarize, including high biodegradability and a strong tendency to sorb to wastewater biosolids, sediment, and soil. As a result, disinfectant Quats are largely removed during wastewater treatment, and those residues discharged in treated effluent are likely to rapidly bind to suspended solids or sediments, thus mitigating their toxicity.

AB Organophosphate esters (OPEs) in atmospheric fine particles (PM2.5) were comprehensively investigated in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region from April 2016 to March 2017. The concentrations of Sigma 8OPEs in all the five sampling sites ranged from 90 to 8291 pg/m(3) (mean 1148 + 1239 pg/m(3); median 756 pg/m(3)). The highest level (median 1067 pg/m(3)) was found at one of the urban sites in Beijing, followed by Tianjin (746 pg/m(3)) and Shijiazhuang (724 pg/m(3)). Tris(2-chlomethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and tri[(2R)-1-chloro-2-propyl] phosphate (TCPP) were the dominant compounds across the five sampling locations. Generally, the concentrations of chlorinated OPEs were relatively higher in summer than in winter (p < 0.05), but no significant seasonal difference was discovered for non-chlorinated individual OPEs. The concentrations of tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP), TCEP, TCPP and triphenyl phosphate (TPP) were positively correlated with the meteorological parameters (i.e. temperature and relative humidity) (p < 0.05), indicating an evident influence of meteorological condition on OPE distribution. We observed a negative correlation (p < 0.05) between octanol-air partition coefficients (logK(oa)) and the ratio of PM2.5 -bound OPE concentrations to total suspended particulates-bound OPE concentrations, suggesting that physicochemical properties affect the particle-size distribution of OPEs. Furthermore, the median value of cancer hazard quotients (HQs) of TCEP was higher than TBP and tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP). The health risk assessment showed that HQ values for children were similar to 1.6 times higher than those for adults. Relatively higher health risk induced by PM2.5-bound OPEs via inhalation was found during severe hazy days than in clear days.

AB Sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) and exogenous L-thyroxine (T4), two kinds of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), mainly affect the circulating thyroid hormones, which regulate the initiation and rate of metamorphosis in amphibian. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential role of EDCs in regulating the development of tadpoles and leptin signaling pathway of liver during the metamorphosis of Bufo gargarizans. There was completely opposite result of average development stage of tadpoles and morphological parameters between the NaClO4 and T4 exposure groups. Histological analysis revealed that NaClO4 and T4 exposure both caused liver injury, such as the decreased size of hepatocytes, atrophy of nucleus, increased melanomacrophage centres and disappearance of hepatocyte membranes. In addition, the results of RT-qPCR revealed that NaClO4 treatment significantly inhibited the transcript levels of genes related to thyroid hormone (D2, TR alpha and TR beta) and leptin signaling pathway (LepR, JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2), while there was an increase of mRNA expression of these genes in the liver of tadpoles administrated with T4 compared with control. This work lays an important foundation for assessing the risk of EDCs in relation to amphibian development during metamorphosis.

AB Triphenyl phosphate (TPP) has been found in various environmental media and in biota suggesting widespread human exposure. However, there is still insufficient information on the hepatotoxicity mechanisms of health risk exposed to TPP. In this study, TPP could induce human normal liver cell (L02) apoptosis, injury cell ultrastructure and elevate the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The integrated multi-omit (transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) analysis was used to further investigate the mechanisms. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that TPP exposure markedly affected cell apoptosis, oncogene activation, REDOX homeostasis, DNA damage and repair. Additionally, proteomic analysis found that the related proteins associated with apoptosis, oxidative stress, metabolism and membrane structure were affected. And metabolomic analysis verified that the related metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, citrate cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, lipid and protein metabolism, were also significantly disrupted. Based on the multi-omic results, a hypothesized network was constructed to discover the key molecular events in response to TPP and illustrate the mechanism of TPP-induced hepatotoxicity in L02 cells. Therefore, molecular responses could be elucidated at multiple biological levels, and multi-omic analysis could provide scientific tools for exploring potential mechanisms of toxicity and chemical risk assessment.

AB Very limited studies have evaluated the impact of rainfall on the fate of endocrine-disrupting micmpollutants in lacustrine systems. This yearlong study investigated monthly fluctuation of bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-nonylphenol (NP) concentrations in both water and sediment samples from Taihu Lake and evaluated the impact of rainfall on their spatiotemporal distribution and partition trends. Results showed that BPA concentration in water was negatively correlated to rainfall while NP concentrations in both phases were positively related to rainfall. The spatial distribution of NP in the lake water was season specific with the lakeshore area higher than the central area during the wet season and a reversed pattern during the dry season. The spatial distributions of sediment-associated NP and BPA in both phases were not significantly different among seasons. Contrary partition tendencies were observed for BPA and NP that BPA tended to desorb from sediment and NP tended to be adsorbed during the wet season while the trends were reversed during the dry season. This study suggests that rainfall could affect the occurrence, distribution and environmental fate of micropollutants and should be considered in the monitoring program and risk assessment.

AB The pollution level of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in surface soils is detrimental to the ecosystem and human health. In this research, various indices such as an index of geo-accumulation (I-geo), contamination factor (CF), degree of contamination (DC), and principal component analysis (PCA) were implemented to identify and evaluate the soil PTEs pollution; and then human health risk assessment model used to establish the link between heavy metals pollution and human health in the urban region of south India. Results exhibited that the mean concentration of Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn were found to be 1.45-6.03 times greater than the geochemical background values. Cr and Cu were the most profuse PTEs measured in the soils. The pollution indices suggest that soil of the study region is mainly moderate to highly polluted. The non-carcinogenic health risk assessment proposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) suggested the mean hazard indices (HIs) were below one which denotes no significant of non-carcinogenic risks to both children and adults. Furthermore, carcinogenic risk assessment results advised similar to 80% of cancer risk was caused by Cr contents, while other heavy metals indicate that neither children nor adults in the study region were of carcinogenic risks.

AB Silicon (Si) is a metalloid which is gaining worldwide attention of plant scientists due to its ameliorating impact on plants' growth and development. The beneficial response of Si is observed predominantly under numerous abiotic and biotic stress conditions. However, under favorable conditions, most of the plant can grow without it. Therefore, Si has yet not been fully accepted as essential element rather it is being considered as quasi-essential for plants' growth. Si is also known to enhance resilience in plants by reducing the plant's stress. Besides its second most abundance on the earth crust, most of the soils lack plant available form of Si i.e. silicic acid. In this regard, understanding the role of Si in plant metabolism, its uptake from roots and transport to aerial tissues along with its ionomics and proteomics under different circumstances is of great concern. Plants have evolved a well-optimized Si-transport system including various transporter proteins like Low silicon1 (Lsi1), Low silicon2 (Lsi2), Low silicon3 (Lsi3) and Low silicon6 (Lsi6) at specific sub-cellular locations along with the expression profiling that creates precisely coordinated network among these transporters, which also facilitate uptake and accumulation of Si. Though, an ample amount of information is available pertinent to the solute specificity, active sites, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of these transporter genes. Similarly, the information regarding transporters involved in Si accumulation in different organelles is also available particularly in silica cells occurred in poales. But in this review, we have attempted to compile studies related to plants vis a vis Si, its role in abiotic and biotic stress, its uptake in various parts of plants via different types of Si-transporters, expression pattern, localization and the solute specificity. Besides these, this review will also provide the compiled knowledge about the genetic variation among crop plants vis a vis enhanced Si uptake and related benefits.

AB The adverse impacts of detrimental thallium (Tl) contamination are of increasing concerns to sustainable development. Herein, the contents, distributions and sources of Tl and potential toxic elements (PTEs) (Pb, As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Co, Sb, Cd and U) were investigated in sediments collected in Gaofeng River, which has been contaminated by long-term mining activities, located in Yunfu City, Southern China. Results indicated that excessive Tl levels were found in sediments (1.80-16.70 mg/kg). Sequential extraction procedure indicated that despite a large amount of Tl entrapped in residual fraction, a significant level of Tl (0.28-2.34 mg/kg) still exhibited in geochemically labile fractions, which was easy for Tl mobilization and availability. Pb isotope tracing method further confirmed that the pyrite exploitations may be the prime contaminated contributor (47-76%) to these sediments. These findings highlight that it is essential to establish more effective measures for Tl contamination control and call for engineered remediation countermeasures towards polluted river sediments.

AB Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) have been extensively used in various industries and reported to inhibit spermatogenesis, however, ZnO NPs-induced spermatogenesis failure is yet to be fully elucidated. Herein, mouse derived spermatogonia cell line GC-1 spg cells were treated with ZnO NPs for 24 h in the presence or absence of radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA), then cell viability was observed by MTT assay; apoptosis was observed by western blotting analysis and AnnexinV-FITC/PI assay, respectively; autophagy was detected by western blotting analysis and transmission electron microscopy, respectively; and the contents of MDA and GSH and the activities of SOD and GSH-PX were measured by oxidative stress kits. The present study showed that ZnO NPs exposure inhibited viability and induced apoptosis of mouse GC-1 spg cells. Intriguingly, ZnO NPs markedly increased the protein content of LC3-II, the ratio of LC3II/LC3-I, and the protein levels of ATG 5 and Beclin 1 in the cells. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that autophagic vesicles in the cytoplasm increased significantly in the ZnO NPs-treated cells, indicating that ZnO NPs could induce autophagy of the cells. Oxidative stress could be induced by ZnO NPs; moreover, inhibition of oxidative stress could alleviate the induction of apoptosis and autophagy by ZnO NPs. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA could rescue the inhibition of cell viability and induction of apoptosis by ZnO NPs, which indicated that autophagy might have cytotoxic effect on ZnO NPs-induced apoptosis. In summary, oxidative stress was involved in ZnO NPs-induced apoptosis and autophagy of mouse GC-1 spg cells, and autophagy might play a cytotoxic role in ZnO NPs-induced apoptosis.

AB The phytoavailability of heavy metals in soils is important for both food safety and environmental management. Hence soil metal phytoavailability threshold values need to be established based on a firm scientific basis. In this study, optimal Cd phytoavailability threshold values, were determined for bean, rice and sesame cultivated in 100 soils varying widely in soil chemical characteristics by comparing the soil Cd phytoavailability obtained using three commonly used extraction procedures. Subsequently, the transfer functions derived in this study, were used to establish soil Cd phytoavailability threshold value standard limits for each specific crop. In addition, independent experimental data were used to supplement the obtained soil phytoavailable Cd threshold value for rice. Soil phytoavailable Cd concentrations extracted by 1 M NH4NO3, 0.05 M EDTA and Mehlich3 solutions were each more significantly correlated with plant Cd concentrations than total soil Cd concentrations. Thus, the soil Cd phytoavailability threshold values proposed in this study provide a more effective means of ensuring safer agricultural food production. Therefore, it is recommended that current agricultural soil heavy metal management policy; which is based on total concentrations; should be changed to embrace soil metal phytoavailability for safer agricultural food production.

AB The toxicity of the insecticide carbofuran and herbicide diuron (individually and in mixture) to the invertebrates Paramecium caudatum and Ceriodaphnia silvestrii was evaluated. Acute and chronic toxicity tests were carried out with the diuron and carbofuran active ingredients and their commercial products, Diuron Nortox (R) 500 SC and Furadan (R) 350 SC, respectively. Individual toxicity tests showed that C. silvestrii was more sensitive to both carbofuran and diuron than P. caudatum. In single exposures, both pesticides caused adverse effects to C. silvestrii in environmentally relevant concentrations (48 h EC50 = 0.001 mg L-1 and 8 d LOEC = 0.00038 mg L-1 for formulated carbofuran; 8 d LOEC < 0.05 mg L-1 for formulated diuron). For P. caudatum, carbofuran and diuron in single exposures were only slightly toxic (24 h IC50 = 5.1 mg L-1 and 6.9 mg L-1 for formulated carbofuran and diuron, respectively). Acute and chronic exposures to diuron and carbofuran mixtures caused significant deviations of the toxicity predicted by the Concentration Addition and Independent Action reference models for both test species. For the protozoan P. caudatum, a dose-dependent deviation was verified for mortality, with synergism caused mainly by carbofuran and antagonism caused mainly by diuron. For protozoan population growth, however, an antagonistic deviation was observed when the active ingredient mixtures were tested. In the case of C. silvestrii, antagonism at low concentrations and synergism at high concentrations were revealed after acute exposure to active ingredient mixtures, whereas for reproduction an antagonistic deviation was found. Commercial formulation mixtures presented significantly higher toxicity than the active ingredient mixtures. Our results showed that carbofuran and diuron interact and cause different toxic responses than those predicted by the individually tested compounds. Their mixture toxicity should therefore be considered in risk assessments as these pesticides are likely to be present simultaneously in edge-of-field waterbodies.

AB Acetylcholine (ACh), a well-known major neurotransmitter, plays a potential role in response to abiotic stresses. However, the mechanism of ACh-mediated cadmium (Cd) toxicity in tobacco seedlings is largely uncharacterized. In this study, a hydroponics experiment was conducted under 100 mu M Cd stress in the presence or absence of ACh (50 mu M) to investigate the potential effects of ACh on Cd toxicity. The results revealed that ACh application effectively alleviated Cd-induced reductions in plant growth, photosynthetic pigments and gas exchange attributes and improved the photosystem II activity. Ultrastructural observation indicated that Cd exposure ruptured the internal structure of chloroplasts, and even caused the accumulation of osmiophilic granules in chloroplasts, whereas these phenomena were alleviated by the addition of ACh. Cd stress also caused a marked increase in oxidative stress, as evidenced by the accumulation of O-2(center dot-) and H2O2, which were efficiently minimized after ACh application by up-regulating antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, SOD; catalase, CAT; ascorbate peroxidase, APX; glutathione reductase, GR). Besides, Cd stress considerably increased the levels of glutathione (GSH), Non-protein thiols (NPTs) and phytochelatins (PCs), whereas ACh application to Cd-stressed seedlings further increased those contents, thereby enhancing the tolerance of Cd-stressed plants. Moreover, exogenously applied ACh declined the accumulation of Cd and minimized the damage from Cd toxicity by modulating the distribution of Cd in the vacuole and cell wall. Therefore, these results provide insights into the ameliorative effects of ACh on Cd-induced a series of physiological reactions.

AB During its development, embryo is easily susceptible to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Evidence demonstrate protective role of the antioxidants, improving both cellular growth and embryonic development. Among these, ellagic acid (EA) is a natural antioxidant with anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogen properties. The aim of this work was to assess in vitro the protective and anti-genotoxic role of EA during Danio rerio (zebrafish) embryonic development. For the study, zebrafish embryos were treated with H2O2 (15 mu M, 30 mu M and 45 mu M) to simulate an oxidative damage, and with EA (2.5 mM, 5 mM and 10 mM) for 8, 20, 24, 48, 96 hpf (hours post fertilization). Vitality rate, alterations in the morphology and behavior of the larvae and the genomic stability were analyzed. The exposure to H2O2 caused genotoxicity for all exposure times. The incubation in 45 mu M H2O2 and 30 mu M H2O2 resulted in increased mortality rate of the larvae, as well as 10 mM EA. The co-exposure was performed using to 15 mu M H2O2 and 2.5 mM and 5 mM EA and it demonstrated the EA capacity to protect the embryo DNA and development from the oxidative insult. Particularly, the co-exposure to 15 mM H2O2 and 5 mM EA showed an increase in the embryo survival rate and absence of alterations in morphology and behavior at 96 hpf. Interestingly, we observed a higher genomic stability at 8h and 20h co-exposure (15 mM H2O2 and 5 mM EA) time. The decline observed in ROS concentration for both exposure times confirmed the observation. In conclusion, EA protects the zebrafish embryonic development from DNA oxidative damage increasing the embryo survival rate and improving morphological parameters of the larvae.

AB Thiazole-Zn is a systemic fungicide synthesized and developed in China that has been used for the prevention and treatment of bacterial and fungal diseases on fruits and vegetables. Thiazole-Zn is a new thyroid disruptor chemical. The purpose of this study was to clarify the thyroid-disrupting property of thiazole-Zn and the mechanism responsible for thyroid hormone (TH) biosynthesis inhibition in male rats induced by thiazole-Zn. First, the effects of different thiazole-Zn doses and exposure times on the thyroid weights, thyroid morphology and serum hormone levels of rats were investigated. The results showed that thiazole-Zn increased thyroid weights and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and induced thyroid cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia in a dose-related and time-related manner. Furthermore, measurement of thyroid radioiodine uptake in vivo in rats confirmed that thiazole-Zn inhibited active iodide uptake into the thyroid, which reduced circulating levels of serum T3 and T4. Decreases in circulating THs resulted in a compensatory increase in serum TSH levels through a negative feedback system. Subsequently, sustained excessive stimulation of the thyroid gland by TSH led to thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia. In addition, thiazole-Zn increased sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) expression in the rat thyroid, and the increased NIS expression promoted and restored iodide uptake into the thyroids of rats. The risk of iodine intake inhibition by thiazole-Zn to humans, especially susceptible individuals, such as children and pregnant women, warrants additional attention.

AB Several studies have demonstrated that PM2.5 inhalation is associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease (CVD), in which inflammation plays an important role. The mechanisms of this disease are not fully understood to date. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in many pathophysiological processes, such as immune responses; however, their functions associated with inflammation are largely unexplored. Highthroughput sequencing assay and obtained numerous lncRNAs that altered the expression in response to PM2.5 treatment in HUVECs. NONHSAT247851.1 was also identified, which was significantly up-regulated to control the expression of immune response genes. Mechanistically, the results indicated that NONHSAT247851.1 knockdown reduced the expression of IL1 beta. In study, we investigated NONHSAT247851.1 as a promoter in regulating immune response genes via binding with raf-1 to regulate the phosphorylation level of p65 protein in HUVECs. The data collected suggests that NONHSAT247851.1 regulates inflammation via interaction with raf-1 to control the inflammatory expression in PM2.5 exposure.

AB Archaea remain important players in global biogeochemical cycles worldwide, including in the highly productive mangrove estuarine ecosystems. In the present study, we have explored the diversity, distribution, and function of the metabolically active fraction of the resident archaeal community of the Sundarban mangrove ecosystem, using both culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches. To evaluate the diversity and distribution pattern of the active archaeal communities, RNA based analysis of the 16S rRNA gene was performed on an Illumina platform. The active Crenarchaeal community was observed to remain constant while active Euryarchaeal community underwent considerable change across the sampling sites depending on varying anthropogenic factors. Haloarchaea were the predominant group in hydrocarbon polluted sediments, leading us to successfully isolate eleven p-hydroxybenzoic acid degrading haloarchaeal species. The isolates could also survive in benzoic acid, naphthalene, and o-phthalate. Quantitative estimation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid degradation was studied on select isolates, and their ability to reduce COD of polluted saline waters of Sundarban was also evaluated. To our knowledge, this is the first ever study combining culture-independent (Next Generation sequencing and metatranscriptome) and culture-dependent analyses for an assessment of archaeal function in the sediment of Sundarban.

AB The study aims to investigate effect of earthworm activity on metal bioavailability in soils using their BSAF-metals. Based on a microcosmic laboratory experiment, epigeic species Amynthas corticis (A. corticis) and en-dogeic species Amynthas robustus (A. robustus) were cultured in two types of soils contaminated by Cd, Zn, Pb and Cu for 120 days. Earthworm characteristics (i.e. numbers, biomass and BSAF), soil properties (i.e. pH, organic C and N contents along with their components such as mineralization and microbial masses) and DTPA extracted metals in soil were determined. After the incubation, the biomass and survival numbers of both earthworm species decreased significantly (P < 0.05). The accumulation of Cd, Zn and Pb in earthworm tissues and BSAF-metals were earthworm species dependent. According to two-way ANOVA, BSAF-Pb clearly showed the effect of different species of earthworms while BSAF-Cu indicated an interactive effect of earthworms and soil type. Earthworms changed soil properties significantly, especially for mineralized C (C-min), dissolved N (N-dis) and pH (P < 0.05). Earthworm activity increase DTPA extracted Zn and Cu, and the effect of A. robustus were stronger than for A. corticis. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that BSAF-Cu and BSAF-Pb contributed for respectively 51.9% and 51.7% of soil properties and DTPA metal changes, indicating that the effects of BSAF-Cu and BSAF-Pb on soil properties and on metal bioavailability in soil were similar. BSAF-Cu, indicating the interactive effect of earthworms and soil, accounted for 38.5% and 45.1% of soil properties and soil metal bioavailability changes. BSAF-Pb, representing the effect of earthworm species, accounted for 13.3% and 6.6% of soil property and soil metal bioavailability variations. Stepwise regression indicated that earthworm might change soil properties through their activities and interactions with soil, and hence increase heavy metal bioavailability. It suggested that BSAF is an important indicator for evaluating the effect of earthworm activity on soil metal bioavailability and designing remediation strategies.

AB Risk assessment regarding heavy metals in tea is crucial to ensure the health of tea customers. However, the effects of geological difference on distribution of heavy metals in soils and their accumulation in tea leaves remain unclear. This study aimed to estimate the impacts of geological difference on distribution of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), thallium (T1), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), and manganese (Mn) in soils and their accumulation in tea leaves, and further evaluate their health risks. 22 soils and corresponding young tea leaves (YTL) and old tea leaves (OTL), from geologically different plantations, were sampled and analyzed. Results showed that heavy metals concentrations in soils, derived from Permian limestone and Cambrian weakly mineralized dolomite, were obviously greater than those from Silurian clastic rock. The geological difference controlled the distribution of soil heavy metals to a large extent. Contents of Cd, Tl, and Mn in tea leaves mainly depended on their contents in soils. Soil Hg, Pb, As, and Sb contents may not be the only influencing factors for their respective accumulation in tea leaves. More attentions should be paid to soil acidification of tea plantations to ensure the tea quality security. Target hazard quotients (THQ) of Cd, Pb, Tl, Hg, As, Sb, Cr, and Ni and hazard index (HI) via tea intake were below one, indicating no human health risk. The non-mineralized Silurian area was less at risk of heavy metals accumulation in tea leaves than the Cambrian metallogenic belt and the Permian Cd-enriched zone. This study could provide an important basis to understand and mitigate the potential risks of heavy metals in tea.

AB The association between environmental pollution and risk of influenza-like illness (ILI) among general population has been reported. However, the relationships between the individual pollutants and ILI risk are still under discussion. Our study aimed to explore the associations of the typical environmental polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metal(loid)s with ILI risk among women population. We carried out a cross-sectional study and included a total of 396 housewives in Shanxi Province, China. The information on their general characteristics and ILI frequency was collected by questionnaire. We collected their hair samples and analyzed the concentrations of PAHs and various metal(loid)s. The results indicated that only acenaphthylene concentration of the nine detected PAH congeners in the hair was significantly associated with ILI risk with adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 0.58 (0.38 - 0.91). Among the concerned 4 toxic metal(loid)s and 15 rare earth elements, only the hair concentration of arsenic had a positive dose-response relationship with ILI risk. In addition, we found that there were negative dose-response associations of the three essential trace elements (i.e. chromium, cobalt, and nickel), and four essential alkaline earth elements (i.e. magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium) with ILI risk. It was concluded that the environmental exposure to certain compounds of housewives may contribute to their ILI development.

AB In this paper, comparison of ecotoxicological and herbicidal effect of newly synthesized N-[(phosphono)(aryl) methyl]glycines 1a-g (C-substituted glyphosate derivatives) with pure glyphosate (N-phosphonomethylglycine) (2) was demonstrated. All of tested glyphosate derivatives (la-g) in contrast to glyphosate, were found to be completely safe for oat (Avena saliva) and classified as not harmful for marine bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri. Compounds 1a-g were also found rather harmless to radish (Raphanus sativus) as compared to N-phosphonomethylglycine, but they were moderately toxic against freshwater crustaceans Heterocypris incongruens. One of synthesized compounds, namely N-[(phosphono)(4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]glycine (1f) was found to possess stronger herbicidal properties against gallant soldier (Galinsoga parviflora) and common sorrel (Rumex acetosa) when compared to pure glyphosate and demonstrated total death of these weeds being ranked 1 in the European Weed Research Council (EWRC) scale. Considering lower phytotoxicity of compound If against cultivated plants and tested microorganisms when compared to pure glyphosate, this aminophosphonate may be good candidate for further, more comprehensive study toward its agrochemical application, especially that this active agent demonstrated much stronger herbicidal properties than N-phosphonomethylglycine.

AB Polysaccharides are the main components of plant cell walls in which they make an important contribution to cadmium (Cd) fixation. However, knowledge regarding the role of root cell wall polysaccharides in Cd accumulation in low-Cd cultivars is limited. Here, we compared the differences in root cell wall polysaccharides between two cultivars of Brassica chinensis L. (pakchoi) with different Cd accumulation abilities. A hydroponic experiment was conducted using low- (Huajun 2) and high-Cd (Hanlv) pakchoi cultivars. We investigated Cd subcellular distribution and Cd accumulation in cell wall polysaccharides and examined polysaccharide modifications in root cell walls by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A Cd adsorption kinetics experiment was conducted to examine the connection between Cd-induced polysaccharide modifications and Cd fixation by cell walls. Amounts of Cd were significantly higher and more Cd was bound to cell walls in the roots of Huajun 2 than in those of Hanlv. These results indicated that the greater Cd retention capacity of the root cell wall in Huajun 2 accounted for the low Cd accumulation in the shoot. Up to 79.4% and 32.1% of cell-wall-bound Cd was found in the pectin and hemicellulose 1, respectively, and higher amounts of Cd were found in these cell wall components of Huajun 2 than in those of Hanlv. Exposure to Cd significantly increased amounts of pectin and hemicellulose 1 in both pakchoi cultivars, but the pectin levels were significantly higher in Huajun 2 than in Hanlv. Huajun 2 had higher pectin methylesterase (PME) activity and a lower degree of pectin methyl-esterification (DM) than Hanlv, although Cd treatments resulted in increased PME activity and decreased DM in both cultivars. The higher Cd treatment (44.5 mu M) resulted in enhanced Cd-binding capacity in root cell walls of the two cultivars with higher Cd adsorption levels in the root cell wall of Huajun 2. These results indicate that differences in the amount of cell wall polysaccharide and DM play key roles in establishing the genotypic differences underlying Cd accumulation in pakchoi. These findings conduce to a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying low Cd accumulation in pakchoi and the breeding of new, low-Cd pakchoi cultivars.

AB Microcystins (MCs) have become an important global environmental issue, causing oxidative stress, which is an important toxic mechanism for MCs in plants. However, the regulating mechanism of antioxidative enzymes in plants in adapting to MCs stress remains unclear. We studied the dynamic effects of MCs at different concentrations (5, 10, 50 and 100 mu g/L) in rice and cucumber seedlings on relative growth rate (RGR), and reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and antioxidative enzyme activities, during a stress period (MCs exposed for 1, 3, 5 and 7 d) and recovery period (7 d). During the stress period, MCs at 5 mu g/L inhibited RGR in cucumber and promoted RGR in rice. The contents of superoxide anion (O-2(center dot-)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and MDA increased and RGR declined in both crops with time and intensity of MCs stress. For cucumber, all these parameters responded earlier to MCs stress, and O-2(center dot-), MDA and RGR were more responsive to MCs stress than in rice. Moreover, catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD), and the relative expressions of CAT genes increased in both crops at 5-100 mu g/L MCs, whereas relative expression of POD genes increased only in cucumber. Diversely, superoxide dismutase (SOD) response to MCs in cucumber leaves was later than for rice. MCs at 100 mu g/L decreased the relative expression of SOD genes in cucumber but did not change SOD activity. During the recovery period, all the above indicators in both crops were higher than the control and lower than in the stress period. Conversely, RGR was lower than in the control and higher than in the stress period, except for cucumber which was lower, and MDA content higher than the stress period at 100 mu g/L MCs. Overall, these results indicated that cucumber was more sensitive to MCs than rice, and SOD, CAT and POD play an important role in plant response to MCs stress.

AB Aquatic environments contaminated by lead (Pb) are a problem in many regions of world. Since Pb has high toxicity, the identification of species for phytoremediation is important for the recovery of these areas. Thus, the phytoremediation potential of Panicum aquaticum Poir. (Poaceae) was evaluated. The anatomical and physiological responses of P. aquaticum were assessed under different concentrations of Pb [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 mM of Pb(NO3)(2)]. Plant growth, anatomy of roots and leaves, root uptake, root to shoot translocation, and the concentration and accumulation of Pb in organs were analyzed. Regarding leaf anatomy, Pb treatment led to changes in epidermis thickness, stomatal density, stomata(diameter, and sclerenchymal area. Endoderm thickness was increased at the highest concentrations of Pb, which may be related to reduced translocation and shoot accumulation. The roots of P. aquaticum presented increased absorption (2279 mu g g(-1) DW-1 of Pb). In conclusion, P. aquaticum was found to have potential for the phytoremediation of areas contaminated with Pb.

AB Epidemiological studies have shown associations between exposure to environmental extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) and health effects, but the mechanisms of ELF-MF induced biological effects remain unclear. We hypothesized that ELF-MF may regulate functions of tissues or cells via its effects on surrounding environment, e.g., culture medium. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of 50 Hz MF on the relative permittivity of zebrafish embryos culture medium as well as of MF-exposed medium on zebrafish embryos development. The responses of medium to 50 Hz MF exposure were evaluated by a phase-sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system. The results demonstrated that MF treatment decreased relative permittivity of zebrafish embryos medium in a dose and time-dependent way. Interestingly, the decreased permittivity induced by MF exposure gradually recovered and approached to the base level when the exposure was removed off. However, MF-exposed medium did not trigger adverse consequences of embryos during zebrafish embryonic development, including mortality, malformation, hatching and heart rate when the MF pre-exposed medium was subjected to one cell-stage embryos. Moreover, the MF-exposed medium did not induce apoptosis of zebrafish embryos at 48 and 72 h post fertilization. Our data demonstrated that the relative permittivity of zebrafish embryos medium was decreased by MF exposure, whereas this decrease failed to result in abnormal development of zebrafish embryos.

Different phosphate products can be prepared, and are more stable than the microbially-induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) in nature. Typical heavy metal oxides were mainly PbO, ZnO, CdO, NiO, CuO and Cr2O3 in the chemical composition of waste incineration fly ash. Microstructure and chemical composition of waste incineration fly ash before and after treatment were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the morphology of the Bacillus subtilis was mainly a rod-like structure. The optimal hydrolysis dosage of the organic phosphate monoester sodium salt was 0.2mol in the bacterial solution (1L, 20 g/L). The optimum required mass of the bacterial powder was 15 g/kg in treatment process of the waste incineration fly ash. The initial concentration of lead ions was 40.28 mg/L in waste incineration fly ash solution. After the optimum dosage treatment, the removal efficiency of lead ions was 78.15%, 79.64%, 77.70% and 80.14% when curing time was 1, 2, 4 and 6d, respectively. The waste incineration fly ash had a Shore hardness of 22 after the optimum amount of bacterial liquid treatment. Results of wind erosion test showed that the wind erosion rate of waste incineration fly ash was 2.6, 0, 0, 0, 0 and 0 g/h when blank group, deionized water, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mL of bacterial solutions treated, respectively. The bio-mineralization method provides an approach for the safe disposal of heavy metals in the contaminated areas of tailings, electroplating sewage, waste incineration plants, and so on.

AB Lead (Pb) is one of the most toxic metals to human and wildlife. It also had multiple negative influences on birds with physical, neurological and hematological clinical signs. However, the impacts of lead on bird liver lipid metabolism are still unclear. In this study, female Japanese quails were used to examine the effects of chronic lead exposure on liver histology, oxidative stress and AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) based lipid metabolism. Quails were randomly divided into 5 groups and each group was respectively fed with 0, 50, 250, 500 and 1000 ppm lead solution for 49 days. The result showed that exposure to 250, 500 and 1000 ppm Pb induced severe histopathological damages characterized by liver lipid vacuoles and accumulation, hepatic cytoplasmic hyalinization and vacuolization, hepatocytes necrosis, hepatic sinusoid congestion, and it also caused ultrastructural alterations featured by swelling and vacuolar mitochondria, the depolymerization of polyribosome, and lipid droplets accumulation. Moreover, significant decrease of activities of GPx (glutathione peroxidase), SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase) and level of T-AOC (total antioxidant capacity) while significant increase of MDA (malondialdehyde) content were found in livers of all Pb groups. In addition, the expressions of genes related to fatty synthesis were significantly upregulated in livers of all Pb groups while the expressions of genes related to fatty beta-oxidation were significantly downregulated in livers of 250 ppm Pb group. The present study indicated lead exposure does cause bird health damages through inducing liver microstructural and ultrastructural injury, oxidative damages and lipid metabolism disorder.

AB The honey bee Apis mellifera is an important pollinator of agricultural crops and natural forests. Honey bee populations have declined over the years, as a result of diseases, pesticides, and management problems. Fungicides are the main pesticides found in pollen grains, which are the major source of protein for bees. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of the fungicide iprodione on midgut cells of adult A. mellifera workers. Bees were fed on iprodione (LD50, determined by the manufacturer) for 12 or 24 h, and the midgut was examined using light and transmission electron microscopies. The expression level of the autophagy gene atg1 was assessed in midgut digestive cells. Cells of treated bees had signs of apoptosis: cytoplasmic vacuolization, apical cell protrusions, nuclear fragmentation, and chromatin condensation. Ultrastructural analysis revealed some cells undergoing autophagy and necrosis. Expression of atg1 was similar between treated and control bees, which can be explained by the facts that digestive cells had autolysosomes, whereas ATG-1 is found in the initial phases of autophagy. Iprodione acts by inhibiting the synthesis of glutathione, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species, which in turn can induce different types of cell death. The results indicate that iprodione must be used with caution because it has side effects on non-target organisms, such as pollinator bees.

AB Copper is an essential micronutrient but its excess in the dietary can be toxic. Both copper deficiency and abundance can occur in natural conditions and can lead to pathological dysfunctions. Many of the toxic effects of copper, such as increased lipid peroxidation in cell membranes and DNA damage, are due to its role in the generation of oxygen free radicals. Copper is released into the environment by both natural sources and human activities and it can damage organisms and ecosystems. In the present work the effects of copper has been studied on Xenopus laevis, an interesting model organism, after three weeks of exposure at 1 mg/L of CuCl, concentration allowed in the water for human use. The effects of this metal were analysed on the liver at light microscope by Hematoxylin-Eosin, Mallory, Pas and Perls stainings to evaluate the general histology, the glycogen metabolism and presence of hemosiderin. Moreover the number and area of melanomoacrophages, known as inflammation parameters, were assessment. Finally, we investigated the expression of atp7b gene and localization of respective ATP7B protein, the membrane protein involved in Cu detoxication. The achieved results showed that copper, even at a low concentration, causes serious histological alterations of liver. It induces an increase in the size and number of melanomacrophages and higher amount of hemosiderin in the treated than controls. Moreover, it alters the gene expression and localization of ATP7B protein. The data are indicative that an exposition at low and chronic concentration of copper in Xenopus laevis damages seriously the liver. For this reason it's important to consider this metal one of the pollutants involved in the decline of the amphibians and for its possible effects in other vertebrates including humans.

AB The herbicide glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine; PMG] and the insecticide chlorpyrifos [O, O-diethyl 0-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyl)-phosphorothioate, CPF] are widely used in agricultural practices around the world and can reach aquatic environments. Therefore, it is necessary to characterize the toxicity of these pesticides on non-target species. The use of biomarkers as a tool to assess responses of organisms exposed to pollutants requires the understanding of their natural fluctuation and the dose-response relationship. In the present work, the effect of the exposure to PMG and CPF on the acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE, biomarker of neurotoxicity) in Cnesterodon decernmaculatus, a native teleost, was evaluated in different environmental conditions. Semi-static bioassays of acute toxicity were carried out under controlled conditions during the four weather seasons of the year using animals of homogeneous size. Circannual rhythms in the basal levels of AChE activity in homogenates of the anterior section were confirmed. Statistically significant average inhibition of AChE activity (47.1 0.7% for 1 g CPF x L-1; 69.7 +/- 2.5% for 5 mu g CPF x L-1; 23.1 +/- 1.1% for 1 mg PMG x L-1 and 32.9 +/- 3.3% for 10 mg PMG x L-1) was determined during summer, winter and spring weather seasons. Interestingly, animals exhibit an increased susceptibility to exposure during the autumn season (inhibition of 55.4 +/- 0.6% for 1 Ng CPF x L-1; 81.9 +/- 3.3% for 5 mu g CPF x L-1; 41.4 +/- 1.7% for 1 mg PMG x L-1 and 61.1 +/- 0.3% for 10 mg PMG x L-1). A different sensitivity of the enzyme between seasons was evaluated by in vitro tests. The inhibition pattern for chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPF-oxon, the active metabolite of CPF) was not affected when test was performed using homogenates of unexposed specimens of summer or autumn. Otherwise, PMG in vitro inhibitory effect was not observed in a wide range of concentrations.
   The results confirm that AChE activity is a sensitive biomarker for exposure to CPF and PMG, even at environmentally relevant concentrations. Finally, this work highlights the existence of seasonal variations in the dose-response relationship, which could be due to variations in the metabolism of the pollutants.

AB To explore the relationship between charge characteristics of rice roots and aluminum (Al) tolerance of rice, roots of 47 different rice genotypes were obtained by hydroponic experiment. The zeta potentials of roots were determined by streaming potential method, and the Al tolerance and the functional groups of rice were measured by relative root elongation and infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), respectively. The exchangeable, complexed and precipitated Al(III) sorbed on the root surface of rice was extracted with 1 mol L-1 KNO3, 0.05 mol L-1 EDTA-2Na and 0.01 mol L-1 HCl, respectively. There was a significant correlation between the zeta potentials and the relative elongation of rice roots, indicating that the zeta potentials of rice roots could be used to characterize rice tolerance to Al toxicity. Twelve Al-tolerant rice varieties, 25 medium Al-tolerant rice varieties, and 10 Al-sensitive rice varieties were obtained. The Al-tolerant rice varieties sorbed less complexed Al(III) and total Al(III) because there was lower negative charge on their roots compared to less tolerant genotypes. A correlation analysis showed that there were significant negative correlations between the zeta potential, relative root elongation, and the total Al(III) sorption capacity of the roots, which further confirmed the reliability of using the root zeta potential to characterize rice tolerance to Al toxicity. The results of this paper provide a new method for screening Al-tolerant rice varieties.

AB Soil salinity and arsenic (As) contamination are serious environmental problems. To investigate the effects of salinity on As uptake and physiological and biochemical attributes of quinoa (Chenopodiwn quinoa Willd.), a hydroponic experiment was performed. One-month old healthy plants of two quinoa genotypes; Vikinga and A7 were transplanted in plastic tubs containing half strength Hoagland's nutrient solution. Plants were exposed to different levels of As (0, 150 and 300 mu M), salinity (0, 150 and 300 mM) and their combinations (150 mu M As + 300 mM NaCI; 300 mu M As + 300 mM NaCl) for five weeks. Results revealed that combined application of salinity and As caused more pronounced reduction in growth, chlorophyll contents and caused more oxidative damage in both quinoa genotypes. Under combined application of salinity and As, Na+ concentration was increased whereas As content was decreased in plant tissues. Quinoa genotype A7 was more tolerant than Vikinga against salinity, As and their combination perhaps because of less uptake of toxic ions and higher activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, POD). Bioconcentration factor (BCF), translocation factor (TF) and tolerance index (TI) indicated that genotype A7 can be successfully employed for phytostabilization of As contaminated saline soils.

AB Microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a widespread environmental contaminant, has been shown to have potent acute testicular toxicity. However, magnitudes of toxic effects, induced by MCs, depend on route and magnitude of exposure to the toxin. In the present study, male mice were orally exposed 1, 10 or 100 mu g/L MC-LR for 90 or 180 days, and pathological approach and the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomics were employed with testes. Proteomics revealed that a number of differentially altered proteins may be involved in MC-LR-induced chronic testicular toxicity. The biological process analysis indicated the altered proteins played an important role in biological adhesion, cellular process, response to stimulus or rhythmic process. The cellular component analysis revealed that most of the proteins with altered expression associated with cell part, extracellular region, extracellular region part, membrane, membrane part, organelle or organelle part. The molecular function showed that these proteins were critical in molecular transducer activity. Integrity analyses provide first compelling evidence that MC-LR significantly cause dysfunction of blood-testis barrier (BTB) through affecting tight junctions and gap junctions. Moreover, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT eventually contributed to injury result from chronic low-level MC-LR treatment. Identification of proteins in testis responsive to MC-LR provides insights into molecular mechanisms of chronic toxicity of MCs.

AB In this study, calcium and magnesium substituted strontium nano-hexaferrites (Sr0.96Mg0.02Ca0.02Fe12O19, SrMgCa nano-HF) were synthesized by the sol-gel auto-combustion method and their impact on the nutrient uptake, magnetic character and physiology of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a crop plant, was investigated. Structural, microstructural, and magnetic properties of nano-HF were evaluated by using vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) along with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and elemental mapping techniques. Plants were hydroponically exposed to nano-HF (ranging from 125 to 1000 mg/L) for three weeks. Results showed that the SrMgCa nano-HF application enhanced germination rate (about 20%), tissue growth (about 38%), biomass (about 20%), soluble protein content (about 41%), and chlorophyll pigments (about 33-42%) when compared to the untreated control. In general, the plants showed the highest growth achievement at 125 or 250 mg/L of nano-HF treatment. However, higher doses diminished the growth parameters. Element concentrations and magnetic behavior analyses of plant parts proved that SrMgCa nano-HF with a size of 42.4 nm are up-taken by the plant roots and lead to increase in iron, calcium, magnesium, and strontium contents of leaves, which were about 20, 18, 3, and 60 times higher in 500 mg/L nano-HF-treated leaves than those of control, respectively. Overall, this study shows for the first time that the four elements have been internalized into the plant body through the application of substituted nanoHF. These findings suggest that mineral-substituted nanoparticles can be incorporated into plant breeding programs for the i) enhancement of seed germination and ii) treatment of plants by fighting with mineral deficiencies.

AB This study provides information on mercury (Hg) localization, speciation and ligand environment in edible mushrooms: Boletus edulis, B. aereus and Scutiger pes-caprae collected at non-polluted and Hg polluted sites, by LA-ICP-MS, SR-mu-XRF and Hg L-3-edge XANES and EXAFS. Mushrooms (especially young ones) collected at Hg polluted sites can contain more than 100 mu g Hg g(-1) of dry mass. Imaging of the element distribution shows that Hg accumulates mainly in the spore-forming part (hymenium) of the cap. Removal of hymenium before consumption can eliminate more than 50% of accumulated Hg.
   Mercury is mainly coordinated to di-thiols (43-82%), followed by di-selenols (13-35%) and tetra-thiols (12-20%). Mercury bioavailability, as determined by feeding the mushrooms to Spanish slugs (known metal bioindicators owing to accumulation of metals in their digestive gland), ranged from 4% (S. pes-caprae) to 30% (B. aereus), and decreased with increasing selenium (Se) levels in the mushrooms. Elevated Hg levels in mushrooms fed to the slugs induced toxic effects, but these effects were counteracted with increasing Se concentrations in the mushrooms, pointing to a protective role of Se against Hg toxicity through HgSe complexation. Nevertheless, consumption of the studied mushroom species from Hg polluted sites should be avoided.

AB Concerns on minimizing health risks of phthalates have been raised due to their widespread exposure and well-documented endocrine disrupting properties, but the determinants of levels, metabolism, and health risks of phthalate exposures have not been thoroughly characterized among the Chinese population, particularly pregnant women. The metabolites of five phthalates were analyzed: diethyl (DEP), diisobutyl (DiBP), di-n-butyl (DnBP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) (DEHP), and benzyl butyl phthalate (BBzP) were analyzed in urine samples collected from 946 mothers in Wuhan during 2014-2015. We applied linear mixed models to investigate the relationships between biomarkers (e.g., urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites, phthalates, and ratios of metabolites) and factors including sampling seasons and epidemiological characteristics. We calculated estimated daily intake (EDI) using average phthalate concentrations over three trimesters and hazard index (HI) by dividing EDI by tolerance daily intake. About 24.9% of participants were at health risks with HI > 1. The largest health risks were driven by one specific phthalate (DnBP or DEHP). We observed lower urinary levels of phthalate metabolites in winter. Elevated levels were found in mothers with higher education levels or those employed. Mothers who got pregnant on purpose had lower phthalate concentrations than those got pregnant by accident. More recent exposure to phthalates was observed among groups of mothers giving birth to girls, or those who got excessive gestational weight gain. Younger mothers were more susceptible to phthalate exposure. This repeated measurement study suggests that the intervention should be taken to limit application and production of DnBP and DEHP, and highlights that typical demographic factors should be taken into account in demographic studies.

AB ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) possess a wide range of biological functions in pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications due to their excellent antimicrobial, optical and UV protective properties. This study first reports the toxicological assessment of ZnO NPs green synthesized from Jatropha curcas shells for multifunctional biomedical applications. The hot water extract of J.curcas shells is utilized as a chelating agent for the reduction of zinc acetate and then, the prepared ZnO NPs are broadly characterized using X-ray spectroscopic and electron microscopic observations. The prepared ZnO NPs acquire high purity (100%) wurtzite crystal with hexagonal structure with the average particle size of 53 nm. In vitro and in vivo toxicity evaluation against human tumor cell lines and zebrafish embryos have ascertained the purpose of ZnO NPs in clinical research. Toxic effects of ZnO NPs were observed by a dose-dependent reduction of bacterial growth at >= 1 mu g ml(-1), by teratogenicity and genotoxicity in zebrafish embryos (from 3 to 90 mu g ml(-1)) and by a significant nanoparticle uptake (0.5 ng mu l(-1)) by a fish serum. In contrast, ZnO NPs fail to reduce the proliferation of human bladder tumor cells (UC6) and cell viability of A549 cells in vitro up to 500 mu g ml(-1). All these observations limit the unobstructed application of ZnO NPs at higher concentrations. Thus, abundantly used metal oxide nanoparticles like ZnO NPs examined in our present study in different animal models under in vitro and in vivo conditions will be the significant screening strategy to determine the nanotoxicity.

AB Marine biota is currently exposed to plastic pollution. The biological effects of plastics may vary according to polymer types (e.g. polystyrene, polyethylene, acrylate), size of particles (macro, micro or nanoparticles) and their shape. There is a considerable lack of knowledge in terms of effects of nanoplastics (NP) to marine biota particularly of polymers like polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Thus, this study aimed to assess its ecotoxicological effects using a battery of standard monospecific bioassays with four marine microalgae (Tetraselmis chuii, Nannochloropsis gaditana, Isochrysis galbana and Thalassiosira weissflogii) and a marine rotifer species (Brachionus plicatilis). The tested PMMA-NP concentrations allowed the estimation of median effect concentrations for all microalgae species. T. weissfiogii and T. chuii were respectively the most sensitive (EC50,96h of 83.75 mg/L) and least sensitive species (EC50,96h of 132.52 mg/L). The PMMA-NP were also able to induce mortality in rotifers at concentrations higher than 4.69 mg/L with an estimated 48 h median lethal concentration of 13.27 mg/L. A species sensitivity distribution curve (SSD), constructed based on data available in the literature and the data obtained in this study, reveal that PMMA-NP appears as less harmful to marine biota than other polymers like polystyrene.

AB Roxarsone (ROX), an organoarsenic feed additive, and its metabolites, can be present in animal manure used to fertilize rice. Rice is prone to absorb arsenic, and is subject to straighthead disorder, which reduces rice yield and is linked with organic arsenic compounds. This study aims to elucidate how soil property affect arsenic accumulation in rice plants fertilized with chicken manure containing ROX metabolites. Manures of chickens fed without or with ROX, designated as control manure and ROX treated manure (ROXCM), respectively, were applied in eight paddy soils of different origins, to investigate the assimilation of arsenic species in rice plants. The results show that inorganic arsenic (arsenate and arsenite), monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) were detected in all brown rice and husk, trace tetramethylarsonium and trimethylarsine oxide were occasionally found in these both parts, whereas all these arsenic species were determined in straw, irrespective of manure type. ROXCM application specifically and significantly increased brown rice DMA (P = 0.002), which remarkably enhanced the risk of straighthead disease in rice. Although soil total As impacted grain biomass, soil free-iron oxides and pH dominated arsenic accumulation by rice plants. The significantly increased grain DMA suggests manure bearing ROX metabolites is not suitable to be used in soils with abundant free-iron oxides and/ or high pH, if straighthead disorder is to be avoided in rice.

AB Chemical oxidation has been applied to remove soil contaminants and thereby reduce human and ecological risks from contaminated sites. However, few studies have been conducted on the natural infiltration of oxidant solutions into unsaturated soil. Moreover, the infiltration capacity of oxidant solutions at various concentrations in unsaturated soil has not yet been studied. This study investigated the natural infiltration tendency of oxidant solutions like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), and sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8), in sand and sandy loam. Cumulative infiltration was recorded from a soil column equipped with a Mariotte reservoir. The infiltration rate, sorptivity, and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity were obtained from the cumulative infiltration results. Na2S2O8 showed the highest infiltration rate in both sand and sandy loam, and the infiltration of Na2S2O8 increased as the concentration was increased from 0.05 to 1%. However, the infiltration of KMnO4 and H2O2 solutions was governed more by chemical reaction behavior than by liquid physical properties or soil hydraulic properties. The production of oxides and gas due to reaction induced clogging in flow paths, resulting in less infiltration. Infiltration of H2O2 at concentrations greater than 0.5% was not observed in sand or sandy loam due to gas formation and swelling.

AB This work evaluated the degradation of the Acid Blue 161 and Procion Red MX-5B dyes in a binary solution by the filamentous fungus Aspergillus terreus and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in systems with and without electrochemical oxidation as the pretreatment process. UV-Vis spectrophotometry, high-performance liquid chromatography with (HPLC), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and Salmonella/microsome assay (Ames test) were applied towards the degradation analysis of the dyes. Adsorption tests with white clay immobilized on alginate were also conducted after the discoloration treatments to remove intermediate metabolites formed during the degradation of the dye molecules. The discoloration treatments led to the complete color removal of the solutions in all the systems tested. The clay demonstrated affinity for the metabolites formed after discoloration treatments, the removal rates were variable, but the all systems has proved efficient. The Salmonella/microsome assay (Ames test) with strains TA98 and TA100 in the absence and presence of exogenous metabolism (S9 microsomal system, Moltox) revealed that the initial molecules and by-products of the metabolism of the dyes were direct mutagens. The electrochemical/A. terreus/clay system was able to discolor the solutions and transform the direct mutagens into non-mutagenic compounds in addition to reducing the mutagenic potency of the pro-mutagens to the Salmonella strain TA100/S9, which demonstrates the high efficiency of this system with regard to discoloring and degrading azo dye molecules and their by-products. Therefore, this study showed that although not having standard treatment system for this type of pollutant, the combination of treatments can be considered promising. The use of electrochemical oxidation along with microbiological treatment may lead to the degradation and mineralization of these compounds, reducing or eliminating the environmental impact caused by the improper disposal of these dyes in aquatic environments.

AB Biochar has been recently used as an alternative strategy to improve soil quality and plant growth in metal contaminated soils. However, the effects of biochar on gas exchange parameters such photosynthetic rate (A), water use efficiency (WUE) and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency (ICE) in metal tolerant plant species in contaminated soils is still unknown. Such information is important to understand how different biochar types can influence plant biomass production and metal uptake. Hence, a greenhouse experiment was set up as a completely randomized design combining two types of crop residue biochar (coconut husk (CB) and orange shell (OB) and two rates of application (30 t ha(-1) and 60 t ha(-1))). A control treatment (no biochar) was also included. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of biochar on the physiological performance, growth and concentration of copper (Cu) in the shoot of B. juncea plants in a Cu-contaminated soil. Besides reduced growth on the control soil, all other treatments increased plant growth. No toxicity symptom was observed in the plant, confirming its Cu tolerance. Biochar increased plant biomass by approximately 170% and reduced Cu concentration up to 51%. Application of 30 t ha(-1) biochar significantly increased net photosynthesis in 59% (CB) and in 34% (OB) while reducing stomatal conductance in 40% and transpiration rate in 14% (CB) and 19% (08). Application of 60 t ha(-1) of biochar reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration rate in 51% and 60% (CB) and 26% and 7% (OB), respectively. All biochars improved the water use efficiency (WUE) in the plants (52-182%) for the instantaneous WUE and 80-162% for the intrinsic (IWUE). Therefore, biochar, especially CB, caused an improved regulation of the stomata aperture so that plant could maintain a high photosynthetic rate while efficiently controlling the use of water. This could be an important mechanism to reduce the excessive uptake of Cu by the plant.

AB Atrazine is one of the widely used toxic herbicide and considered as serious environmental contaminant worldwide due to its long term use in crop production. In this study, the effect of surfactin lipopeptide produced by Bacillus velezensis MHNK1 on atrazine biodegradation was investigated. B. velezensis MHNK1 produced 0.83 +/- 0.07 g/L of anionic biosurfactant that reduced surface tension from 72.12 +/- 0.02 to 33.2 +/- 0.61 mN/m and CMC was 40 mg/L with 85.21 +/- 1.60% emulsification index. Further, biosurfactant was characterized as surfactin by TLC, HPLC, FTIR, H-1 and C-13 NMR and LCMS-ESI. B. velezensis MHNK1 showed 87.10 +/- 3.10% atrazine biodegradation within 5 days which was revealed by HPLC and MS analysis. Atrazine biodegradation using a combination of B. velezensis MHNK1 (2%) and surfactin (2 CMC) resulted in 100 +/- 1.20% degradation within 4 days. Presence of atrazine degrading genes in B. velezensis MHNK1 was also confirmed by PCR. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports available on atrazine degradation using B. velezensis strain and also in combination with surfactin. The results of this study reveal that strain B. velezensis MHNK1 and surfactin can be potential source of ecofriendly application for removal of atrazine from contaminated sites.

AB Peroxidases and catalases are well-known antioxidant enzymes produced in almost all living organisms for the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thus they prevent the occurrence of oxidative stress. In our study we focused on two soil fungi of the family Chaetomiaceae (mesophilic Chaetomium cochliodes and its thermophilic counterpart C. thermophilum var. dissitum) in order to explore the presence of peroxidase and catalase genes, formation of their native transcripts and protective effect of corresponding translation products in a case study. Predicted genes of our interest were confirmed by genomic PCR and their inducible transcripts by RT-PCR. We were able to quantify the expression levels of newly discovered fungal heme peroxidases and catalases with the reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR method. We compared obtained quantitative levels of mRNA production with the level of corresponding extracellular protein occurrence as detected with monitoring their specific peroxidase and catalase activities directly in the cultivation media at optimal growth temperatures. The presence of secretory Catalase 2 from C. thermophilum var. dissitum was detected and identified with mass spectrometry approach directly in the growth medium. This unique catalase is phylogenetically closely related with a previously described catalase-phenol oxidase thus representing an effective and versatile antioxidant in the environment of the fungal mycelia also involved in the catabolism of recalcitrant phenolic substances.

AB The effects of Bt Cry9Ee toxin on honey bee, Apis mellifera L., survival, developmental rate, larval weight, pollen consumption, and midgut bacterial diversity were tested in the laboratory. Honey bee larvae and adults were reared in vitro and fed a diet that contained Cry9Ee toxin at 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/L. Cry9Ee toxin 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/L in diet used in this study may represent a value closer to field relevance and the highest concentration is unlikely to be encountered in the field and thus represent a worst case scenario. The dependent variables were compared for groups of honey bees feeding on treated diet and those feeding on negative control (no addition of a test substance), solvent control (0.01 mM Na2CO3), and positive control diet (dimethoate 45 mg/L). Bt Cry9Ee toxin did not affect survival or larval weight, and the result was great confidence in accepting the null hypothesis by power analysis. The effect on development rates and pollen consumption were the inconclusive results because the post-hoc power was less than 0.8. Furthermore, the midgut bacterial structure and compositions were determined using high-throughput sequencing targeting the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rDNA. All core honey bee intestinal bacterial class such as gamma-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria, Bacilli, beta-Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidia were detected, and no significant changes were found in the species diversity and richness between Cry9Ee treatments and laboratory control.

AB Numerous chemicals have been manufactured through industrial activities and used as consumer products since the late 18th century. Non-target analysis is a new analytical tool to detect many chemicals in environmental samples and to prioritize emerging contaminants. In this study, suspect and non-target analytical methods were optimized using gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight (GC/TOF) to propose contaminants of emerging concern for the Arctic environment. A suspect analytical method was developed with qualification and qualifier ions, isotopic ratios, and retention times of 215 contaminants including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to establish an in-house library. Non-target analytical method was also optimized with a deconvoluted ion chromatogram, which is a form that can possibly match the mass spectrum of the NIST library. Multiple environmental samples, such as seawater, air, soil, sediment, sludge, and iceberg, collected from the Arctic region were analyzed with suspect and non-target analysis of GC/TOF after the clean-up procedure with a solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. The commonly detected contaminants in the Arctic environmental samples were siloxanes, organophosphate flame retardants, phthalates, synthetic musk compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Among them, siloxanes and organophosphate flame retardants were proposed to be contaminants of emerging concerns for the Arctic environment. This is the first report to prioritize emerging contaminants in the Arctic environment with suspect and non-target analysis of GC/TOF.

AB Fenpropathrin (FNP) is a member of the synthetic pyrethroids. Herein, the present study was conducted to investigate, for the first time, the potentially harmful effects of FNP on the reproductive system of male rats. In addition, the prophylactic or concurrent influence of camel milk (CM) was assessed. Adult male rats were divided into five groups; control, vehicle control (oil), CM (2ml/rat/day), FNP (15mg/kg bwt/60 days), CM/FNP (prophylaxis) and FNP/CM (co-treated) groups. Sperm morphology, count, serum testosterone (TES), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TSARS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), testicular enzymes, and comet assay analysis were estimated. In addition, histopathology, the ultrastructure of testicular tissue and apoptosis were evaluated. Reduced body weight and gonadosomatic index were observed in the FNP exposed group. TES, LH, FSH were markedly declined following FNP treatment. SOD and TAC concentrations were reduced while PC and TSARS were significantly elevated in FNP group indicating oxidative stress. Furthermore, FNP induced DNA damage and apoptosis in the testis which was evidenced histopathologically and by electron microscope examination. CM significantly counteracted FNP reprotoxic effects, particularly at the prophylactic routine (CM/FNP) than the co-exposure (FNP/CM) one. Conclusively, these findings verified that CM could be a potential candidate therapy against FNP reprotoxic impacts.

AB Atmospheric deposition of heavy metals is widely documented and has been connected to adverse ecological and health impacts. The influence of atmospheric deposition on the soil rice system in a typical urban agglomeration region was studied continuously through a field contrast experiment for two years. The results showed that the Cd and Pb in rice grains is mainly from soil, but Cd and Pb from the atmospheric deposition should be a focus of attention. The bioavailable content of heavy metals in atmospheric deposition is higher than that in corresponding surface soil. Atmospheric deposition contributed 10.8-47.7% of the Cd and Pb in brown rice, and 13.7-60.3% of the Cd and Pb in rice leaves was from atmospheric deposition. In the traffic area, a high deposition site, the contributions of atmospheric depositions to heavy metals in rice plants were higher than those from abandoned mine area and suburban area. Atmospheric deposition also consistently decreased the pH (0.17-0.66) and increased the exchangeable Cd (27.1-62.1%) and Pb (3.3-26.1%) in surface soil. In addition, the health risk index (HRI) of rice consumption was also increased as a result of the different atmospheric depositions of heavy metals, which accounted for 40.0% and 35.5% of Cd and Pb at the high deposition site, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential influences of atmospheric deposition on the soil crop system and human health, and can also provide a useful reference for developing the emission control strategies.

AB A greenhouse experiment was conducted to investigate an enhanced phytoremediation technique for multi-metal contaminated mine tailings by Solanum nigrum L. and using biochar/attapulgite as soil amendments. The 10% attapulgite (MA(2)) and 10% biochar (MB2) were recommended as the optimum chemical proportions for amendment materials. Plant length and fresh weight in the MA(2)/MB2-applied treatments were significantly higher than that in the non-amended treatment, indicating MA(2) and MB2 amendments could alleviate metal phytotoxicity. Metal uptake in plant leaves was lower with MA(2) and MB2 application than that in the non amended treatment. However, metal uptake in plant roots was significantly increased with MA(2) and MB2 application from the fifth month, suggesting that MA(2) and MB2 had significant enhancement on metal stabilization. Temporal variation of metal translocation in soil-to-plant system showed that the function of MA(2) and MB2 reached the plateau nearly in the seventh month. The removal rates of metals were higher after the application of MA(2) than MB2, and by the following order: Cu (39.6%) > Zn (35.0%) > Cd (34.1%) > Hg (32.1%) > Pb (31.8%) > Mn (19.1%). The synergistic effect between S. nigrum L. and MA(2)/MB2 appeared to be particularly effective in terms of metal phytostabilization, and MA(2) was superior to MB2.

AB Selenium (Se) enrichment has been demonstrated to vary by several orders of magnitude among species of planktonic algae. This is a substantial source of uncertainty when modelling Se biodynamics in aquatic systems. In addition, Se bioconcentration data are largely lacking for periphytic species of algae, and for multi-species periphyton biofilms, adding to the challenge of modelling Se transfer in periphyton-based food webs. To better predict Se dynamics in periphyton dominated, freshwater ecosystems, the goal of this study was to assess the relative influence of periphyton community composition on the uptake of waterborne Se oxyanions. Naturally grown freshwater periphyton communities, sampled from five different water bodies, were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of selenite [Se(IV)] or selenate [Se(VI)] (nominal concentrations of 5 and 25 mu g Se L-1) under similar, controlled laboratory conditions for a period of 8 days. Unique periphyton assemblages were derived from the five different field sites, as confirmed by light microscopy and targeted DNA sequencing of the plastid 23S rRNA gene in algae. Selenium accumulation demonstrated a maximum of 23.6-fold difference for Se(IV) enrichment and 2.1-fold difference for Se(VI) enrichment across the periphyton/biofilm assemblages tested. The assemblage from one field site demonstrated both high accumulation of Se(IV) and iron, and was subjected to additional experimentation to elucidate the mechanism(s) of Se accumulation. Selenite accumulation (at nominal concentrations of 5 and 25 mu g Se L-1 and mean pH of 7.5 across all treatment replicates) was assessed in both unaltered and heat-killed periphyton, and in periphyton from the same site grown without light to exclude phototrophic organisms. Following an exposure length of 8 days, all periphyton treatments showed similar levels of Se accumulation, indicating that much of the apparent uptake of Se(IV) was due to non-biological processes (i.e., surface adsorption). The results of this study will help reduce uncertainty in the prediction of Se dynamics and food-chain transfer in freshwater environments. Further exploration of the ecological consequences of extracellular adsorption of Se(IV) to periphyton, rather than intracellular absorption, is recommended to further refine predictions related to Se biodynamics in freshwater food webs.

AB Natural and synthetic estrogens have been widely detected in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and effluent as well as in the corresponding receiving aqueous environment and other ecosystems. Microalgae can be used to remove nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater, but the species-dependent removal of estrogens needs further investigation. In this study we investigated estrone, 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol removals and transformation products by four common microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis, Selenastrum capricornutum, Scenedesmus quadricauda, and Chlorella vulgaris. It was found that H. pluvialis, S. capricornutum and S. quadricauda could more effectively remove all three estrogens in synthetic wastewater effluent. The estrogenic activities i.e. 1713-estradiol equivalency determined by yeast estrogenic screening assay showed substantial estrogenic activity reductions after biotransformation by H. pluvialis, S. capricornutum, and S. quadricauda. Quadrupole Time-of flight Mass Spectrometry results identified several possible ring-cleavage metabolites as well as their metabolic pathways, which had not been reported yet, confirming the estrogen degradation rather than mere absorption or uptake by microalgae. The findings demonstrate that not only can some specific bacteria degrade estrogens, but also the widely living microalgae are able to degrade these emerging pollutants, suggesting that microalgae could be an advanced treatment of WWTPs to remove nutrients and estrogens.

AB Little data are available on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in marine fish associated with oil and gas activities from the South China Sea (SCS). Twenty-one wild marine fish species from the northern South China Sea were collected for analysis of the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The total concentration of the PAHs (Sigma(16)PAHs) ranged from 199 to 606 ng.g(-1) d.w., indicating moderate contamination. PAHs in fish species found in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) were significantly higher than those from the Yachen (YC) gas fields (p < 0.05). Planktivorous fish exhibited significantly higher concentrations of PAHs than carnivorous and omnivorous fish (p < 0.05). The PAHs were dominated by three ring compounds. Source identification analyses indicated that the PAH pollution originated from petroleum inputs. The cancer and non cancer risk assessments concluded that the probable risk associated with the intake of PAHs via fish consumption is minimal. Long-term monitoring is necessary to determine the ecological impacts of PAHs associated with oil and gas activities.

AB Lemna minor could tolerate and accumulate more than 5,000 mu g g(-1) DW of cobalt (Co) without foliar symptoms, indicating it is a Co hyperaccumulator. However, the physiological and metabolomics mechanisms that are responsible for Co accumulation and tolerance are largely unknown. In the present study, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggested that C=O, C-H, and O-H groups are involved in Co biosorption. The activation of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, guiacol peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione reductase, as well as ascorbic acid and glutathione might be involved in capturing reactive oxygen species as evidenced by decreased malondialdehyde in fronds treated with Co. Metabolomics analysis revealed that Co stress significantly increased the production of several amino acids (except aspartic acid and cysteine at 200 mu M) and organic acids (with the exception of succinic acid). In particular, an approximate 15-fold increase was noted in the citric acid concentration. Upon exposure to Co, increases were observed in citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activities, and a decrease was observed in isocitrate dehydrogenase related to the metabolism of organic acids. Overall, the increase in concentration of organic and amino acids and antioxidants support their effective involvement in improving Co tolerance and accumulation in L. minor.

AB Alberta's oil sands petroleum coke (PC) generation has in recent years surpassed 10 million tonnes. Petroleum coke has been proposed as an industrial-scale sorbent to reduce concentrations of organic chemicals in oil sands process-affected water (OSPW). However, PC contains up to 1000 mg of vanadium (V) per kg of PC, and during the treatment it leaches from coke reaching levels of up to 7 mg/L in "treated" OSPW. Little information is available on how common water quality variables affect the toxicity of V to aquatic organisms. Here descriptive relationships are presented to describe how site-specific surface water characteristics representative of the Alberta oil sands region influence the toxicity of V to Daphnia pulex. Results revealed that when D. pulex was exposed to an increase in pH, a threshold relationship was found where acute V toxicity increased from a lethal median concentration (LC50) of 1.7 to 1.2 mg V/L between pH 6 and 7 and then levelled off at around 1 mg V/L. When alkalinity (from 75 to 541 mg/L as CaCO3) and sulphate (from 54 to 394 mg/L) increased, the acute toxicity of V decreased slightly with LC(50)s changing from 0.6 to 1.6, and from 0.9 to 1.4, respectively. When the length of V exposure was extended (from 2 to 21 d), only an increase of sulphate from 135 to 480 mg/L caused a slight increase in V toxicity from a LC50 of 0.6 to 0.4 mg V/L, the opposite trend seen in the acute exposures. In addition, the influence of two OSPW representative mixtures of increasing sodium and sulphate, and increasing alkalinity and sulphate on V acute toxicity to D. pulex were evaluated; only the mixture of increasing sodium (from 18 to 536 mg/L) and sulphate (from 55 to 242 mg/L) caused a slight decrease in V acute toxicity (LC50 1.0-2.1 mg V/L). Evidence is presented that variations in surface water chemistry can affect V toxicity to daphnids, although only to a small degree (i.e. within a maximum factor of 2 in all cases evaluated here). These relationships should be considered when creating new water quality guidelines or local benchmarks for V.

AB Chloroperoxidase (CPO) is a hybrid of two different families of enzymes, peroxidases and P450s. However, it is poorly understood on CPO's multiple catalytic functions. Herein, phenol was selected as a model substrate to investigate the multiple catalytic roles of CPO. Results showed that phenol was readily transformed into a variety of brominated organic compounds (BOCs) via the CPO-mediated oxidative process. A total of 16 BOCs were identified using gas and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Possible reaction pathways could be attributable to four CPO-mediated processes, including bromination, radical coupling, intramolecular cyclization and debromination. Higher bromide concentrations and lower pH conditions both facilitated the formation of brominated products. While a higher bromination capacity was observed in pH 3.0 solutions, CPO-mediated radical couplings were more favorable at pH 5.0 and 6.0. Although CPO might catalyze chlorination when chloride and bromide coexisted in the solution, BOCs were the dominant products of CPO-mediated phenol oxidation. Results of this study suggest that various catalytic roles of CPO may contribute to the biotic formation of BOCs in the natural environment.

AB The rational of the current study was to assess whether Tribulus terrestris extract (TTE) could alleviate long-term copper (Cu) overload-induced testicular dysfunction compared to enalapril and losartan. Rats were administered either vehicle (control group, n = 10) or copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O, 200 mg/kg, p.o) for 90 days (n = 40). Cu-treated rats were randomized into four equal groups. One group was left untreated (Cu group) while the remaining three groups were daily co-treated with one of the following treatments along with CuSO4: TTE (10 mg/kg, p.o); enalapril (30 mg/kg, p.o); losartan (10 mg/kg, p.o). Excess Cu intake resulted in Cu overload coupled with a significant elevation in systolic blood pressure and serum angiotensin II levels along with a reduction in serum nitric oxide level. All concomitant treatments led to an alleviation of such deleterious effects. However, only losartan failed to ameliorate angiotensin II elevation. Additionally, all treatments protected the testes against Cu-overload-elicited zinc depletion and oxidative stress. Regarding reproductive function, the relative weights of testes, serum levels of testosterone and luteinizing hormone; the expression of steroidogenic genes; the protein levels of angiotensin II type 1 receptor and angiotensin converting enzyme 1, in addition to its activity, they were significantly reduced. Amongst all treatments, only TTE and E were able to revert these reproductive changes. In conclusion TTE and E were able to protect against Cu overload-induced impairment of testicular steroidogenesis. Thus, they might be considered as prophylactic drugs of choice against hypertension and testicular dysfunction to ameliorate Cu overload risk.

AB Pesticides and medications have adverse effects in non-target organisms that can lead to different modes of action (MOAs). However, no study has been performed to compare the MOAs between different levels of aquatic species. In this study, theoretical equations of interspecies relationship and excess toxicity have been developed and used to investigate the MOAs among fish, Daphnia magna, Tetrahymena pyriformis and Vibrio fischeri for pesticides and medications. The analysis on the interspecies correlation and excess toxicity suggested that fungicides, herbicides and medications share the similar MOAs among the four species. On the other hand, insecticides share different MOAs among the four species. Exclusion of insecticides from the interspecies correlation can significantly improve regression coefficient. Interspecies relationship is dependent not only on the difference in interaction of chemicals with the target receptor(s), but also on the difference in bio-uptake between two species. The difference in physiological structures will result in the difference in bioconcentration potential between two different trophic levels of organisms. Increasing of molecular size or hydrophobicity will increase the toxicity to higher level of aquatic organisms; on the other hand, chemical ionization will decrease the toxicity to higher level organisms. Hydrophilic compounds can more easily pass through cell membrane than skin or gill, leading to greater excess toxicity to Vibrio fischeri, but not to fish and Daphnia magna.

AB Previous studies have demonstrated that the anti-androgenic effects of cypermethrin (CYP) are associated with testosterone (T) - related signaling pathway. This study was to investigate the effects of CYP on mouse Sertoli cells (TM4) and clarify whether the mechanisms were mediated by non-classical T signaling pathway activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) and Real-Time Cell Analysis iCELLigence (RTCA-iCELLigence) system were performed to detect the effects of 10 mu M, 20 mu M, 40 mu M and 80 mu M CYP on the viability and proliferation of TM4. The mammalian two hybrid assay, quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot were conducted to analyze the key genes and proteins involved in T-mediated MAPK signaling pathway. CYP was found to inhibit the viability and proliferation of TM4. Additionally, CYP disturbed the functions of Sertoli cells by inhibiting inhibin B (INH B) expression and facilitating androgen binding protein (ABP) and transferrin (TF) expression. Moreover, CYP suppressed the interaction of AR and Src kinase and inhibited androgen-mediated phosphorylation of Src, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), extracellular-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Furthermore, the androgen-induced mRNA and protein expression of CREB-regulated gene early growth response factor (Egr1) decreased after treated with CYP. It is indicated that CYP inhibits the viability and proliferation of Sertoli cells and non-classical T signaling pathway activation of MAPK cascade is involved in anti-androgenic effect of CYP. This study provides a novel insight into the CYP-induced reproductive toxicity.

AB Pot experiment was conducted to examine the effects of rainwater-borne hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on transformation of Cu, Zn from pig manure in soils and its resulting impacts on the growth of Cu and Zn uptake by a rice plant. Results showed that the exogenous application of H2O2 significantly improved the rice biomass and yield. Addition of H2O2 into the soils led to reduced uptake of soil-borne Cu and Zn by the rice plants and this had a significant effect on reducing the accumulation of Zn in rice grains. It was indicated that the increased pH in soil might play important role in reducing Cu and Zn content in rice. Furthermore, Cu and Zn content in exchangeable form and carbonate bounded form dramatically decreased in soil, on the contrary, the organic combination state increased significantly in H2O2 treatment. The findings point to a potential research direction that rainwater-borne H2O2 in nature may help to change morphology of heavy metals in natural soil environments, but further study is still needed to explore the related mechanisms in Cu and Zn in manures and paddy rice field receiving rainwater-borne H2O2.

AB Microcystins is a class of monocyclic of heptapeptides with many different isomerides. It has become potential hazardous material in water environment for its toxic, distribution and stability. This project worked on a method for determination of trace microcystin (MC-LR and MC-RR) in environmental waters. The ionic liquid magnetic graphene (IL@MG) was prepared and applied to the concentration and determination of microcystins, based on magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE), and coupled with ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The ionic liquid magnetic graphene was prepared by co-precipitatial synthesis and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), specific surface area (BET), pore size distribution (BJH) and magnetic hysteresis loop. The experimental parameters of magnetic solid phase extraction, including amount of IL@MG, pH, extraction time and elution solvent were investigated by a univariate method and orthogonal screening. The method showed good linearity in the range of 0.01-10.0 g/L and 0.005-10.0 mu g/L for MC-LR and MC-RR, when the pH of water samples was 4.00 and 10.0 mg adsorbents were used to extract targets for 18 min. The lowest detection limit was 0.414 ng/L and 0.216 ng/L for MC-LR and MC-RR respectively. The recoveries of the microcystins were in the range of 83.6-100.9%, and the relative standard deviation was less than 7.59%. The trace amount of MC-LR (0.020 mu g/L) and MC-RR (0.003 mu g/L and 0.021 mu g/L) was detected in actural water samples. Attributed to its simple operator, low detection limit and high sensitivity, this method could be used for the detection of trace microcystins in water samples.

AB The study has been carried out to develop a plant-microbes assisted remediation technology to accelerate polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) degradation and heavy metals (HMs) removal in a microcosmic experiment. The quaternary mixture of PAHs (phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, and benzo [a] pyrene) and metals (Cr, Ni, and Pb) spiked the soil, constructing a microcosm; the microcosms were bioaugmented with newly developed plant bacterial consortia (Cpm(1) and Cpm(2)). The microcosms were amended with biochar (sieved particle size 0.5-2 mm) as redox regulators to reduce oxidative stress of plant-microbe systems. To formulate the two plant-bacterial consortia, plant species were collected and bacteria were isolated from oil spill soil. The bacterial strains used in two formulated consortia includes - Cpm(1) (Enterobacter cloacae HS32, Brevibacillus reuszeri HS37, and Stenotrophomonas sp. HS16) and Cpm(2) (Acinetobacter junii HS29, Enterobacter aerogenes HS39 and Enterobacter asburiae HS22). The PAHs degradation and metal removal efficacy of the consortia (Cpm(1) and Cpm(2)) were studied after 24 weeks of trial. The physicochemical properties of microcosm's soil (M-2 and M-3) were assessed after experimentation, which resulted in the finding that the soil exhibits dropped in pH from basic to neutral after application of the plant microbes consortium. The electrical conductivity was lower in M-2 and M-3 soils, with a range between 1.60 and 1.80 mS/cm after the treatment. The Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) results illustrate how metabolites with the different molecular weight (M.W) were found in M-2 and M-3 soils (184-446), as a result of the plant-microbes mediated rhizodegradation of four spiked PAHs. The metals in microcosm's soil are very low in concentration after 24 weeks of trial when compared to control (M-1). The Cr, Ni and Pb removal percentages were found in 45.79, 42.19 and 44.85 in M-2. However, the removal percentages were found to be 45.41, 41.47 and 44.25 respectively for these same HMs in M-3 soil. Both the consortia that were newly developed showed similar trends of metals removal and PAHs degradation. This study provides a breakthrough in the area of rhizosphere engineering with the goal of maintaining a sustainable application of plant-microbes in ecosystem services.

AB Combined effects of cadmium (Cd) and acid rain on physiological characteristics in Eleocarpus glabripetalus seedlings were investigated under controlled conditions. The single Cd treatment and the combined Cd and acid rain treatment increased growth at low Cd concentrations, while decreased growth and photosynthesis at high Cd2+ concentrations. A low Cd2+ concentration (50 mg kg(-1)) combined with different acid rain treatments increased the seedling biomass. A high Cd2+ concentration (100 mg kg(-1)) under different acid rain treatments significantly decreased the biomass, the Fe content, chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic parameters. Relative electric conductivity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and peroxidase (POD) activity were increased while the reduced glutathione (GSH) content and catalase (CAT) activity were significantly lower at high Cd2+ concentration under acid rain. The results indicated that the combination of a high concentration of Cd2+ and acid rain aggravated the toxic effect of Cd2+ or acid rain alone on the growth and physiological parameters of E. glabripetalus due to serious damage to the chloroplast structure. These results provide novel insights into the combined effects of Cd(2+ )and acid rain on woody plants and might also serve as a guide to evaluate forest restoration and biological safety in areas with Cd2+ and acid rain pollution.

AB UV-B radiation is an important environmental factor. Exposure to excess UV-B radiation can cause serious effects on the development, survival, and reproduction of different organisms. Plants and animals have developed many different strategies to cope with UV-B-induced damage, but the physiological response of insects to UV-B remains unclear. In the present study, the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) was used to assess the stress response of UV-B. The underlying molecular mechanisms were explored using RNA sequencing. We investigated the transcriptomic profile of T. castaneum larvae at 4 and 24 h after treatment with UV-B radiation via digital gene expression analysis. The 310 and 996 differentially expressed genes were detected at 4 and 24 h, respectively. Then the biological functions and associated metabolic processes of these genes were determined by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. The reliability of the data was verified using qRT-PCR. The results indicated that several differentially expressed genes are involved in anti oxidation, DNA repair, protein folding, carbon flux diversion, and the extracellular matrix to protect against UV-B -induced damage. This study will increase our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying insect response to UV-B radiation.

AB The increasing load of organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) has generated wide concerns about their potential residues in aquatic environments. The uptake and translocation of fourteen OPFRs by wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were studied under hydroponic conditions. The results revealed that OPFRs were removed from hydroponic solution by wheat, and the removal processes followed first-order kinetics. After 10 days, the removal efficiencies were in a range of 57.9 +/- 3.8% - 63.8 +/- 5.6%. The potential for translocation of these OPFRs from the roots to foliage was also assessed. OPFRs with relatively higher hydrophobicity were more likely taken up by roots, and OPFRs with lower hydrophobicity were more prone to be translocated. Root concentration factors (RCFs), transpiration stream concentration factors (TSCFs), and foliage/root concentration factors (FRCFs) were calculated. Furthermore, significant correlations were found between RCF, FRCF or TSCF values of OPFRs and log K-ow (p < 0.05), and translocation of OPFRs depended on their physicochemical properties. The findings of this study develop better understanding of accumulation and translocation of OPFRs in plants, which is valuable for environmental and human health assessments of such kind of contaminants.

AB To explore the acute health effects of ozone(O-3) and PM2.5 on daily cardiovascular disease mortality in all the cities of Jiangsu province, China. Daily average concentrations of ozone (maximum 8-h average), fine particle matter (PM2.5), meteorological data (including temperature and relative humidity) and daily cardiovascular diseases mortality data were collected from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017, in all the 13 cities of Jiangsu Province in China. The time-series model linked with Poisson distribution was used to estimate the correlation between O-3 and daily cardiovascular diseases mortality, after adjusting for PM2.5 and other pollutants. Firstly, we evaluated the acute effects of O-3 on cardiovascular mortality in each city in Jiangsu province, and then we combined the effects of O-3 on cardiovascular disease mortality by meta -analysis. The single-pollutant model indicated that the acute health effects of O-3 in different cities were quite different. After combined the effects of 13 cities, the mortality of cardiovascular diseases increased by 0.983% ( 95%CI : 0.588-1.377%) for every 10 mu g/m(3) increases of O-3. O-3 showed the strongest effect on 3-day moving average concentration (Lag 0-3). After adjusting PM2.5 NO2, SO2, and CO, the results were still statistically significant at the multi-city level. The study found that Oa had a greater effect on women; the elderly population was susceptible and high education groups were more vulnerable to O-3, although the differences between different subgroups were insignificant. The dose-response curve showed that the mortality of cardiovascular disease increased with the increase of O-3. The increase in O-3 concentration of atmospheric can increase the daily mortality of cardiovascular diseases in Jiangsu, China.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) is extensively used in various fields because of its versatility. The presence of GO in the environment enhances the toxicity of toxicants or pollutants. Cadmium (Cd) and GO pollution is a problem in aquatic environment, which should be solved. We investigated the toxic effects of Cd on photosynthesis and oxidative stress in wheat seedlings in the presence of GO, by measuring seedling biomass, Cd content, photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, antioxidant enzyme activities, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. At low concentrations, GO alone had limited effects, but at concentrations > 20 mg L-1, seedlings were negatively affected. Under combined Cd-GO treatment, GO was significantly toxic at only 5 mg L-1 concentration, and increasing concentration significantly increased Cd accumulation and decreased biomass. The net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, primary maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, actual quantum yield, photosynthetic electron transport rate, chlorophyll content, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase concentration decreased significantly, whereas intercellular CO2 concentration increased significantly. These changes can be attributed to impairment of ROS level, antioxidant enzyme activities, and MDA level, and toxicity mechanisms are suggested to be due to oxidative stress. The resulting damage to the photosynthetic systems and structures likely contributed to the overall decrease in biomass.

AB A Pseudomonas sp. DNE-S1 (GenBank accession number MF803832), able to degrade DEP in a wide range of acid-base conditions, was isolated from landfill soil. The growth kinetics of DNE-S1 on DEP followed the inhibition model. Fe-3+ could promote the degradation ability of DNE-S1 to DEP probably by over-expression of the gene phthalate dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (ophB) and phthalate dioxygenase ferredoxin reductase (ophA4). The degradation rate of DEP (500 mg L-1 at 12 h) increased by 14.5% in the presence of Fe3+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+ showed an inhibiting effect on the degradation performance of the strain and could alter the cellular morphology, surface area and volume of DNE-S1. Three degradation intermediates, namely ethyl methyl phthalate (EMP), dimethyl phthalate (DMP), and phthalic acid (PA), were detected in the biodegradation of DEP, and the biochemical pathway of DEP degradation was proposed. This study provides new information on the biochemical pathways and the responsible genes involved in DEP degradation.

AB Excessive chromium (Cr) causes toxicity to plants, while the beneficial effects of selenium (Se) have been verified in plants under various adverse conditions. Under Cr stress, the impacts of exogenous Se on root morphology and metal element uptake were investigated in root of Chinese cabbage by cellular and biochemical approaches. Exogenous Se alleviated Cr-induced irreversible damage to root morphology, plasma membrane integrity and ultrastructure of root tip cells. Compared with Cr treatment alone, exogenous Se reduced root Cr content by 17%. Se supply changed the subcellular distribution of Cr in root, and the concentration of Cr was reduced in the fractions of plastids and mitochondria, while increased in soluble fraction. Besides, exogenous Se counteracted the nutrient elements (Na, Ca, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) loss induced by Cr. For plant with Se pretreatment, the increase rate of Cr influx was lower than that of plant without Se pretreatment, particularly in solution containing high concentration (100-400 mu mol L-1) of Cr. In addition, higher K-m value was observed in plant with Se pretreatment, which indicated a lower Cr affinity than that of plant without Se pretreatment. The results suggest that Se modified root morphology and regulated nutrient elements uptake by root, which might play a combined role in reducing Cr uptake by root, consequently alleviating Cr stress and maintaining plant growth.

AB Dioxins (PCDDs), furans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) emitted into the environment can accumulate in foods and become a significant source of dietary exposure for consumers of these compounds. This study aims to assess the dietary exposure of the residents in a rural area of the Silesia region in southern Poland to PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs. The goal is to estimate cancer and non-cancer health risks due to the consumption of foods of animal origin. The area has relatively higher concentration of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs in the air in comparison to large industrialized cities of the Silesia province. Three popular foods of animal origin, namely free-range chicken meat, free-range chicken eggs, and cow milk produced in the farms were used. The control samples were the same foods from the local grocery stores. Two exposure scenarios were considered: Firstly that residents consumed free-range foods and secondly that the food items were purchased from stores in the study area. In the first scenario, exposure to concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) yielded evidence of elevated cancer and non-cancer risks. The hazard quotient (HQ) was 71.3 for non-cancer risk and 7.5 x 10(-3) for cancer risk. The health risk from exposure to PCDDs, PCDFs and dl-PCBs in the second scenario was 6.9 x 10(-4) and HQ = 0.8, respectively. Implementation of educational activities in the study area is needed to increase the resident's awareness of the risks associated with the emissions of chlorinated persistent organic pollutants to the environment, including aspects such as the main sources of the emission and how to avoid exposure to these compounds.

AB Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used in daily life. However, common utilization of ZnO NPs results in increases in environmental release, and their health hazards have attracted extensive attention. To investigate the cytotoxicity of ZnO NPs and their mechanism in HepG2 cells, a comprehensive analytical system was developed. The internalization, cytotoxic mechanism, death mechanism and elimination behavior of three sizes of ZnO NPs were studied by electrothermal vaporization (ETV)-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), MIT assays, GSH measurements, ROS measurements and analyses of apoptosis and gene expression. The size-, dose- and time-dependent characteristics of ZnO NPs were determined, and the metabolism of ZnO NPs in cells was discussed. The cytotoxicity of ZnO NPs was confirmed to depend on both the size and concentration and was attributed to the release of Zn2+, induction of oxidative stress and inflammatory response; the death mode of HepG2 cells incubated with ZnO NPs was necrotic rather than programmed cell death.

AB An extensive investigation on spatial distribution and environmental risk assessment based on total content and fractions of heavy metals, as well as the cancer risk of Cd from seven adjacent contaminated paddy fields at Xiangtan City, southern China, was conducted in this study. A total of 63 soil samples were analyzed for soil physical properties and concentrations of eight heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn). The results showed that concentrations of metals except for Cr, Mn and Ni exceeded the background values to varying degrees, and particularly, content of Cd was as 57.4-612 times higher than background values. Principal components analysis and correlation analysis revealed three groups: industry activities for Cd and Zn; natural sources mainly for Cu, Pb, Ni and Cr, with some slight anthropogenic activities for Cu and Pb accumulation; and manganese ore associated with cobalt for Co and Mn. Combined with different indices, Cd and Zn were the major contributors to the ecological risk, and cancer risk of Cd indicated an unacceptable degree in this area. Altogether, results from this study will facilitate a better understanding of metals distribution characteristics and provide a scientific basis for further comprehensive management for these paddy fields. Combination of functional microbial agent and plants promises to be a feasible and effective remediation method for cadmium pollution in the study area.

AB Seaweed Gracilaria lemaneiformis is the main dietary source of the abalone mariculture industry in China. In this study, we examined the protection of selenium (Se)-enriched G. lemaneiformis against cadmium (Cd) toxicity in the abalone, Haliotis discus hannai, using various indices including metal concentration (Se and Cd), growth rate, GPx enzymatic antioxidants, and metallothionein (MT) concentration over a period of 28 days of exposure. The growth rates and Se contents increased significantly in abalones fed with Se-enriched G. lemaneiformis, while the toxicity of Cd was reduced. Seven to 12 days Cd exposure to the Se-enriched G. lemaneiformis not only affected GPx activity but the MT levels fluctuated irregularly. MT concentrations increased after 3 days exposure and then gradually decreased to the control level after Day 7. There were statistically significant positive correlations between MT levels, GPx activity and Se concentrations, and negative relationships between MT levels, GPx activity and Cd levels in abalones. These findings suggest that Se-enriched Gracilaria protects abalone against Cd toxicity. The possible mechanism is the induction of MT with a concomitant increased capacity of GPx enzymatic antioxidants.

They were investigated important issues resulted during the chronic exposure with DM: effects on aggressive behavior and swimming performances knowing that is a high neurotoxic compound; toxicity on nervous system investigated on telencephalon, optic tectum and cerebellum; activity of PCNA, p53 and TUNEL as toxicity markers in immunocytochemistry of the histological samples; changes of elements concentrations in the fish body and their role in detoxification of DM. This scenario investigated the harmful effects of this compound for freshwater fish communities. The aggressive behavior significantly increased and remained constant for the concentration 0.5 mu g L-1. They were not evidences in changing of anxiety level and swimming performances. The nervous system suffered significant damage for all studied concentrations and confirmed the changes in the behavior. Selenium concentration in the body decreased and may be involved in the detoxification processes.

AB The toxicity and persistence of the halogenated aromatics, particularly brominated phenolic compounds have drawn serious concerns to the environment, emphasizing the potential effects on human health and ecosystems balance. Advanced oxidation process (AOP) has received much attention as an alternative for the conventional wastewater treatment methods to treat water contaminated with toxic pollutants. This study investigated the degradation and detoxification of p-bromophenol (p-BP) by a novel Zr/Ag-TiO2 @rGO photocatalyst under visible light. Upon 3 h of visible light irradiation over Zr/Ag-TiO2 @rGO, more than 95% of p-BP (15 mg/L) degradation was achieved at a rate of 0.23 min(-1). The degradation products were identified by GC-MS and possible degradation pathway was proposed. The phytotoxicity evolution of the degraded products was assessed on Vigna radiata (V. radiata), in which seeds treated with pure p-BP showed less germination (40%) compared to degradation products (100%). Furthermore, the germination index (GI) of p-BP was found to be 11.1% before degradation while it increased to 80.5% after 3 h of degradation indicated that this photodegradation process achieved detoxification of p-BP. Thus, this study demonstrated that p-BP elimination and detoxification could be simply achieved with Zr/Ag-TiO2 @rGO nanocomposite under visible light irradiation, which provides new solution for wastewater treatment and water reuse in crop irrigation.

AB Chemical environmental pollution is currently one of the most concerning environmental problem on a global scale, due to the high risks posed to ecological systems and human health. Risk assessment methodologies are valuable tools for preventive management and the mitigation of human health risks. However, the application of these methodological tools involves several steps and the knowledge of many variables, which can hinder its correct implementation. The main objective of this work was the development of the computational code for human health risk assessment: HHRISK (Human Health Risk). This code allows for an agile and accurate risk assessment based on the methodology established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). Different from other published methods, the HHRISK code includes a new spatiotemporal matrix for the analysis of the aggregated risk (for multiple exposure pathways) and the cumulative (for exposure to multiple chemicals). HHRISK was applied to two case studies published dealing with the assessment of risk to human health through exposure to toxic metals, obtaining satisfactory results. The concordance between the average results obtained with the HHRISK and those reported by the authors confirm the validity of the implemented model. The inclusion of a greater spatiotemporal detail of the risks allowed to carry out a more accurate analysis and to propose new subsidies for a more efficient risk mitigation management by affected place and period of time.

AB Although numerous studies have investigated the association between air pollution and hospitalization, few studies have focused on the health effect of air pollution on populations with hypertension. In this study, we conducted a time-series study to investigate the acute adverse effect of six criteria ambient air pollutants (fine particulate matter [PM2.5], inhalable particulate matter [PM10], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], sulfur dioxide [SO2], ozone [O-3], and carbon monoxide [CO]) on hospitalization of patients for hypertension in Shijiazhuang, China, from 2013 to 2016. An over-dispersed Poisson generalized addictive model adjusting for weather conditions, day of the week, and long-term and seasonal trends was used. In addition, we evaluated the effect of modification by season, sex, and age. A total of 650,550 hospitalization records were retrieved during the study period. A 10 mu g/m(3) increase of PM2.5(lag06), PM10(lag06), NO2(lag03),O-3(lag6), and CO (lag04) corresponded to 0.56% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28-0.83%), 0.31% (95% CI: 0.12-0.50%), 1.18% (95% CI: 0.49-1.87%), 0.40% (95% CI: 0.09-0.71%), and 0.03% (95% CI: 0.01-0.05%) increments in hospitalization of patients for hypertension, respectively. We observed statistically significant associations with PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O-3, and CO, while positive but insignificant associations with SO2. The effects of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O-3, and CO were robust when adjusted for co-pollutants. We found stronger associations in the cool season than in the warm season. Moreover, there were non-significant differences in the associations between air pollution and sex or age group. This study suggests that patients with hypertension had an increased risk of hospital admission when exposed to air pollution.

AB Melatonin is a multifunctional signaling molecule that regulates broad aspects of responses to environmental stresses in plants. Cadmium (Cd) is a persistent soil contaminant that is toxic to all living organisms. Recent reports have uncovered the protective role of melatonin in alleviating Cd phytotoxicity, but little is known about its regulatory mechanisms in plants. In this study, we found that foliar application of melatonin (in particular 100 mu mol L-1) remarkably enhanced Cd tolerance of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) leaves, as evidenced by less Cd accumulation and alleviation of growth inhibition and photoinhibition, compared with nontreated Cd-stressed plants. The addition of melatonin also controlled oxidative damage of Cd on tobacco through direct scavenging and by enhancing the activities of antioxidative enzymes. Melatonin application promoted Cd sequestration in the cell wall and vacuoles based on the analysis of subcellular distribution of Cd in tobacco cells. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that melatonin-induced Cd tolerance in tobacco leaves was modulated by the expression of Cd-transport genes. Molecular evidence illustrated that modulation of IRT1, Nramp1, HMA2, HMA4, and HMA3 genes caused by melatonin could be responsible for weakening Cd uptake, Cd transportation to xylem, and intensifying Cd sequestration into the root vacuoles.

AB The use of biosensors by using microorganisms such as bacteria have short life cycles and provide other advantages. One colorimetric biosensor technique that has been developed is the use of a biosensor utilizing the incorporation of Prussian blue formation reactions mediated by E. coli bioreactors with ferricyanide. Immobilization is a method that allows the bacteria can be used for long-term without reducing its ability as bioreceptor. This study aimed to develop a novel and rapid immobilized bacterial biosensor for the detection of toxic compound in water and to evaluate their analytical performances. Immobilization of E. coil performed by trapping method using alginate material support. The bacterial suspension was mixed with sodium alginate (1:1 v/v), and the mixture was continuously dropped in CaCl2 solution to be a form of beads. The beads were used as bioreceptor to detect toxicants regarding cadmium, arsenic, mercury, chromium and lead solutions with Prussian blue as a colorimetric indicator. The linearity and sensitivity of detection of beads to the toxicants were tested, the stability of repeated use and storage were evaluated as well. The results showed that E. coil could be immobilized using alginate with response value was correlated with toxic concentration. The developed biosensor was more stable when used repeatedly and could be stored in a long time. The immobilization of E. coil in calcium alginate bead was successfully performed as a biosensor system for monitoring acute toxicity in water.

TI MAPK/AP-1 pathway activation mediates AT1R upregulation and vascular

AB Acute and chronic exposure to particulate matter (PM) 2.5 is associated with adverse health effect upon the cardiovascular (CV) system. However, the molecular mechanism by which PM2.5 evokes CV injuries has not been fully clarified. In our recent report, we demonstrate that exposure to PM2.5 leads to elevation of circulating angiotensin II (ANGII) levels and local expressions of angiotensinogen (AGT, the precursor of ANGII), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ANGII type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the vascular endothelial cells, which subsequently instigates the oxidative stress and proinflammatory response in the vascular endothelium. In the present study, we disclosed that PM2.5 exposure induced the activation of the transcriptional factor AP-1 and its components, c-Jun and ATF2, in the human vascular endothelial cells. Although the DNA-binding sites for AP-1 were identified within the promoter regions of AGT, ACE and AT1R genes, RT-PCR and immunoblot assays indicated that AP-1 transactivation was only involved in AT1R upregulation, but did not affect the induction of AGT and ACE expression under the same conditions. Furthermore, ERKs and p38K functioned as the upstream protein kinases involving in AP-1 transactivation and AT1R upregulation under PM2.5 stimulation. In addition, the oxidative stress and proinflammatory responses in the PM2.5-treated vascular endothelial cells were significantly reduced when MAPKs and AP-1 activation were inhibited. Therefore, we conclude that PM2.5 exposure induces MAPK/AP-1 cascade activation, which contributes to AT1R upregulation and vascular endothelial dysfunction. Identifying novel therapeutic targets to alleviate AP-1 transactivation and restore AT1R expression may be helpful for the management of PM2.5-induced CV burden.

AB Vertical up-flow constructed wetlands (CWs) with manganese ore (Mn ore) as media (M-CWs) were developed to treat simulated polluted river water. The results showed that the average removal efficiencies for NH4-N, NO3-N, TN and TP were 91.74%, 83.29%, 87.47% and 65.12% in M-CWs, respectively, which were only 79.12%, 72.90%, 75.85% and 43.23% in the CWs without Mn ore (C-CWs). Nutrient mass balance showed that nitrogen (N) removal was improved by enhanced microbial processes, media storage and plant uptake in M-CWs. Moreover, almost 50% of phosphorus (P) was retained by media storage because of the adsorption processes on Mn ore. It was found that addition of Mn ore enhanced denitrification as the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria increased. The produced Mn(II) and more abundant Gammaproteobacteria confirmed alternative N removal pathways including anoxic nitrification coupled to Mn ore reduction and denitrification using Mn(II) as electron donor. Mn(II) concentration in the effluent of M-CWs was below the drinking water limit of 0.1 mg/L, which makes them environmentally-friendly.

AB Food Yellow 4 (FY4) is a lemon-yellow-colored synthetic organic azo dye, which is used widely for imparting pleasant and attractive appearance to foods and cosmetics. The present study aimed at evaluating the possible mechanism underlying the FY4-induced reprotoxicity in rats, and the potential supportive role of royal jelly (RI) or cod liver oil (CLO), which is a natural remedy with several pharmacological benefits, against induced toxicity. Forty-eight male rats were divided into different groups-the control group, the CLO group (0.4 mL/kg), the RJ group (300 mg/kg), the FY4 group (500 mg/kg b.w.), and the co-treated groups (FY4 + CLO or FY4 + RJ). Semen analysis, serum hormones, and enzyme activities were estimated. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using anti-PCNA, anti-Sox 9, anti-STRA8, anti-DMC1, and anti-ssDNA antibody. The FY4 group exhibited a significant decrease in sperm concentration and motility percentage (%) and a substantial reduction in the TES and LH levels. Testicular LDH, ACP, and SDH were observed to be inhibited. Furthermore, co-localization of DMC1 and ssDNA, which reflected apoptotic induction in the leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes, respectively, was observed to have markedly elevated in the FY4 treated rats, with fewer PCNA-positive and SOX9-positive cells and higher ssDNA-positive cells in the seminiferous epithelium in comparison to the control groups. Interestingly, co-treatment with CLO or RI exhibited healthy sperms and restored their features, activated the enzyme production, and raised the levels of sexual hormones. In addition, both RJ and CLO restored the features of the testicular tissue as observed under a light microscope, and limited the apoptosis as observed through antibody staining. Collectively, the results of the present study revealed that the co-administration of RI or CLO with FY4 improved the biochemical, hormonal, and structural aspects of the testicular tissue in rats. Therefore, CLO and RJ may be considered promising agents that would be able to improve the testicular structure and function in the FY4-exposed individuals.

AB Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is often used as chlorinated hydrocarbon herbicides and insecticides, which has been suggested that toxicity of carcinogenic effect, teratogenic effect and reproductive system. However, there was still precious known about the underlying molecular mechanism of PCP on mammalian early development. To explore the developmental toxicity of PCP and its potential mechanism, pregnancy ICR mice except controls were exposed to PCP (0.02, 0.2 or 2 mg/kg) during gestation day (GD) 0.5 to GD8.5 in this study. We found that the fetal loss rate was increased and placental chorionic villi structure was disorder in hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) on GD16.5. Meanwhile, autophagosomes were observed in chorionic villi through Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Moreover, the mRNA and/or protein expression of P62, LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclinl were increased in placenta, indicating the occurrence of autophagy. Then, to further explore the autophagy mechanism, microRNA (miR)-30a-5p, an expression inhibitor of Beclinl, was predicted through bioinformatics predictions and RT-PCR, and it was reduced in PCP-treated mice. Transfection and luciferase reporter gene test were used to verify the interaction between Beclinl and miR-30a-5p. These results firstly indicate that, PCP exposure could downregulate the expression of miR-30a-5p, and then induced autophagy through upregulation of Beclinl to result in fetal loss. Our study laid a foundation for understanding the PCP developmental toxicity through autophagy.

AB Maduramicin, a potent polyether ionophore antibiotic, has been widely used to control coccidiosis in the poultry production. Nevertheless, incomplete metabolism of maduramicin in chicken may result in its accumulation in the aquatic environment, while maduramicin's threat to fish remains largely unknown. In the present study, we focused on acute toxicity, histopathological lesion and oxidative stress damage of maduramicin in adult zebrafish. Primarily, we obtained that the 96-h median lethal concentration (96 h LC50) of adult zebrafish exposure to maduramicin was 13.568 mg/L. On basis of that, adult zebrafish were separately exposed to 0.1 mg/L (1/125 LC50), 0.5 mg/L (1/25 LC50) and 2.5 mg/L (1/5 LC50) maduramicin for 14 days. On day 3, 0.1 mg/L maduramicin significantly increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione s-transferase (GST) in the liver of zebrafish, while the activities of these antioxidant enzymes in the liver were significantly inhibited by 2.5 mg/L maduramicin. Moreover, the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver of different dose groups were all significantly promoted after 14 days of exposure. For the gill of zebrafish, the increase in MDA contents was found after only 3 days of exposure to maduramicin. Furthermore, maduramicin treatment significantly up-regulated the mRNA levels of genes (sodl, gpx1a, gstr, nrf2 and keapl) in the liver of zebrafish after 3 days of exposure. On days 6, 9 and 14, maduramicin treatment significantly down-regulated the mRNA levels of these genes in the liver of zebrafish. Meanwhile, maduramicin significantly down-regulated the mRNA levels of genes (sod1, cat, gpx1a, gstr, nrf2 and keapl) in the gill of zebrafish during the 14-day of exposure. In addition, a dose-dependent induction in histopathological lesion was observed in multiple organs after 14 days of exposure, including lamellar fusion, epithelial lifting in the gill and vacuole formation in the liver as well as the fracture of intestinal villus in the intestine. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that waterborne maduramicin (2.5 mg/L) exposure can induce severe oxidative stress and tissue damage in adult zebrafish while this damage was not enough to kill them after 14 days of waterborne exposure.

AB Trace elements were measured in the edible tissues of target marine species (Sardina pilchardus, Mullus barbatus, Mullus surmuletus, Merluccius merluccius and Parapenaeus longirostris) collected in some of the main ports of the Sicilian coast (southern Italy) in order to evaluate the potential human health risk associated to their consumption. Cadmium, Pb and Hg were below the tolerable limits reported by the European Union in foodstuffs (Commission Regulation (EC) 1881/2006) except for Hg in P. longirostris from one sampling site. The health risk for consumers was assessed both for adults and children calculating the estimated weekly intake (EWI), the target hazard quotient (THQ) and the lifetime cancer risk (CR) for each element. The EWI did not exceed the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) recommended by the European Food Safety Authority and THQs were < 1 in most cases. Further, the probabilistic distributions of health hazard were evaluated through Monte-Carlo simulation which confirmed a non-carcinogenic risk. With some exceptions related to As exposure, the results obtained definitively confirm the goodness of the fishery commercial resources in one of the most important seafood market of the central Mediterranean Sea and represent a positive data for the assessment of the good environmental status for descriptor 9 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive in this area of the basin.

AB Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) may be functionalised with a surface coating to enhance their properties, but the ecotoxicity of the coatings and how hazard changes with ageing in soil is poorly understood. This study determined the toxic effect of CuO ENMs with different chemical coatings on the earthworm (Eisenia fetida) in fresh soil, and then after one year in aged soil. In both experiments, earthworms were exposed for 14 days to the CuO materials at nominal concentrations of 200 and 1000 mg Cu kg(-1) dry weight and compared to CuSO4. In the fresh soil experiment, CuO-COOH was found to be the most acutely toxic of the nanomaterials (survival, 20 +/- 50%), with tenfold increase of total Cu in the earthworms compared to controls. Sodium pump activity was reduced in most CuO ENM treatments, although not in the CuSO4 control. There was no evidence of glutathione depletion or the induction of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in any treatment. Histology showed a mild hypoplasia of mucous cells in the epidermis with some nanomaterials. In the aged soil, the CuO-NH4+ was the most acutely toxic ENM (survival 45 +/- 3%) and Cu accumulation was lower in the earthworms than in the fresh soil study. Depletion of tissue Mn and Zn concentrations were seen in earthworms in aged soil, while no significant effects on sodium pump or total glutathione were observed. Overall, the study showed some coating dependent differences in ENM toxicity to earthworms which also changed after a year of ageing the soil.

AB In this study, nanoscale zerovalent Fe-0/Cu-0 bimetallic composites were synthesized by liquid-phase reduction of Fe(II)/Cu(II) and applied for decomposition of tridecane dicarboxylic acid (DC13). The removal performance of Fe-0/Cu-0 bimetallic composites for DC13 in terms of Fe/Cu ratios, addition amount, reaction time and initial pH were studied. The as-prepared nanoscale composites were characterized by a transmission electron micrographs (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET surface area, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP). Finally, the degradation mechanisms of DC13 utilizing the Fe-0/Cu-0 nanocomposites were investigated by using mass spectrumetry (MS). The results indicated that the Fe-0/Cu-0 bimetallic composites exerted a remarkable removal capacity for DC13 through the multiple reactions, e.g., coagulation, adsorption and center dot OH reduction in the Fe-0/Cu-0 system. XPS indicated that the Fe/Cu reduction reaction of hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) system played a significant role in degradation of DC13 and the LC-MS result suggested that DC13 was degraded into inorganic small molecules by center dot OH radicals generated from the corrosion of Fe-0. The experimental results indicated that the nanoscale Fe-0/Cu-0 could be used as a potential material to remove DC13 because of its remarkable degradability.

AB Bioremediation of heavy metal polluted soil using metal-resistant bacteria has received increasing attentions. In the present study, we isolated a heavy metal-resistant bacterial strain from a Cd-contaminated soil, and conducted pot experiments to evaluate the effect of bacterial inoculation in soil on soil Cd speciation, rice grain biomass and Cd accumulation. We find that the isolated bacterial strain is a Gram-negative bacterium, and named as Delftia sp. B9 based on the 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis. TEM-EDS manifests that Cd can be bioaccumulated inside cell, resulting in intracellular dissolution. The Cd contents of rice grain in the two rice cultivars (early and late rice) are all below the standard limit for Food Safety of People's Republic of China (0.2 mg/kg) after the treatment of both living and non-living cells. Non-living cells are more applicable than the use of living cells for the short time bioremediation. The average content of soil exchangeable fraction of Cd decreases whereas the residual fraction increases with bacterial inoculation. All our results suggest Delftia sp. B9 is able to the stabilization of Cd in soil and reduce Cd accumulation in rice grain, therefore, this strain is potentially suitable for the bioremediation of Cd-contaminated paddy soils.

AB Ubiquitous low-dose methylmercury (MeHg) exposure through an increased fish consumption represents a global public health problem, especially among pregnant women. A plethora of micronutrients presented in fish affects MeHg uptake/distribution, but limited data is available. Vitamin A (VitA), another fish micronutrient is used in nutritional supplementation, especially during pregnancy. However, there is no information about the health effects arising from their combined exposure. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the effects of both MeHg and retinyl palmitate administered on pregnant and lactating rats in metabolic and redox parameters from dams and their offspring. Thirty Wistar female rats were orally supplemented with MeHg (0,5 mg/kg/day) and retinyl palmitate (7500 mu g RAE/kg/day) via gavage, either individually or in combination from the gestational day 0 to weaning. For dams (150 days old) and their offspring (31 days old), glycogen accumulation (hepatic and cardiac) and retinoid contents (plasma and liver) were analyzed. Hg deposition in liver tissue was quantified. Redox parameters (liver, kidney, and heart) were evaluated for both animals. Cytogenetic damage was analyzed with micronucleus test. Our results showed no general toxic or metabolic alterations in dams and their offspring by MeHg-VitA co-administration during pregnancy and lactation. However, increased lipoperoxidation in maternal liver and a disrupted pro-oxidant response in the heart of male pups was encountered, with apparently no particular effects in the antioxidant response in female offspring. GST activity in dam kidney was altered leading to possible redox disruption of this tissue with no alterations in offspring. Finally, the genomic damage was exacerbated in both male and female pups. In conclusion, low-dose MeHg exposure and retinyl palmitate supplementation during gestation and lactation produced a potentiated pro-oxidant effect, which was tissue-specific. Although this is a pre-clinical approach, we recommend precaution for pregnant women regarding food consumption, and we encourage more epidemiological studies to assess possible modulations effects of MeHg-VitA co-administration at safe or inadvertently used doses in humans, which may be related to specific pathologies in mothers and their children.

AB Safety of drinking-water is an urgent for human health. It is critical to promote the cheap technologies for water purification to guarantee the free-pathogens-drinking water. The present study has been investigated the antibacterial activity of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers membranes which decorated by Ag, CuO or ZnO nanoparticles as bactericides. The hybrid nanofiber composites were fabricated by electrospinning technique and the obtained membranes were characterized using SEM, EDX and FTIR. Their antibacterial activity was evaluated against E. coil and S. aureus. The data was revealed that the functionalization was successfully obtained by the incorporation of nanoparticles as an additive into the polymer solution which associated many superior properties. Continuous PAN membrane fibers with average diameters from 170 to 250 nm without any beads of plain and its hybrid membrane composites were obtained. The antimicrobial activity was estimated using both disk diffusion tests and growth kinetic models. The antibacterial activity was improved as the concentrations of nanoparticles enhanced. This study provided the real solution for production and inactivation of bacteria which related to the impregnated the PAN nanofibers membrane with Ag, CuO or ZnO NPs. The results have significant implications for finding a safe and an inexpensive path to solve the problems of drinking water, especially in the developing countries.

AB Recently we found that direct exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) might induce toxicological responses through the modulation of ER stress gene expression, but whether this signal could be transferred from other cells to endothelial cells (ECs) is unknown. This study investigated the toxicity of pristine and carboxylated MWCNTs to HUVECs and alveolar-endothelial co-culture, the later of which could mimic the possible signaling communications between ECs and MWCNT exposed alveolar cells. The results showed that direct contact with high levels of MWCNTs induced cytotoxicity and modulated expression of genes associated with ER stress (HSPA5, DDIT3 and XBP-1s) and autophagy (BECN1 and ATG12) both in A549-THP-1 macrophages cultured in the upper chambers as well as HUVECs. However, most of these responses were minimal or negligible in HUVECs cultured in the lower chambers. Moreover, significantly increased cytokine release (interleukin-6 and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) was only observed in MWCNT exposed HUVECs (p < 0.01) but not HUVECs cultured in the lower chambers (p > 0.05). The minimal or even absent response was likely due to relatively low translocation of MWCNTs from upper chambers to lower chambers, whereas A549-macrophages cultured in the upper chambers internalized large amount MWCNTs. The results indicated that ER stress-autophagy signaling might not be able to transfer from alveolar cells to endothelial cells unless sufficient MWCNTs are translocated.

AB Fe3O4 particles decorated Zr pillared bentonite (Fe3O4/Zr-B) were successfully synthesized, which were used to treat stabilized landfill leachate by Fenton-like process. The organics removal and biodegradability were both significantly improved owing to good catalytic stability of the magnetically recoverable catalyst. With the catalyst dosage of 1.0 mg L-1, initial pH of 2 and peroxide concentration of 0.1 mmol L-1, the COD removal efficiency increased to 68% and BOD5/COD of 0.27 was achieved. According to the results of the GC-MS, Fenton-like reaction with Fe3O4/Zr-B had an excellent removal performance for almost all the heterocyclic compounds. The 3D-EEM fluorescence spectra indicated that the fluorescence intensity was dramatically reduced and the UV humic-like and fulvic-like substances were removed effectively during the catalytic degradation. It seemed advisable to implement this process as a pre-treatment to facilitate the further biological treatment.

AB In this work, the essential oil (EO) was extracted from the fruits of Evodia lenticellata, and the fumigant toxicity, contact toxicity and repellency against three stored-product insect species were evaluated for the obtained EO and several of its chemical components. The target insects were the adults of Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), Lasioderma serricome (Coleoptera: Anobiidae) and Liposcelis bostrychophila (Psocoptera: Liposcelididae). The EO was obtained with hydrodistillation and its chemical components were analyzed with the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Twenty-seven compounds, accounting for 83.1% of the total amount of the oil, were identified from the EO sample. The main compounds included linalool (12.0%), beta-pinene (11.5%), 3-carene (9.6%), caryophyllene oxide (8.7%) and beta-caryophyllene (7.9%). Among them, the amounts of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were as high as 52.7% and 22.7% to the total amount of EO respectively. The results of bioactivity test showed that the EO and its testing compounds had interspecific toxicity and repellent activity. So that, it might be expected that the EO extracted from the fruits of E. lenticenata could be developed to a new type of eco-friendly natural insecticide or repellent for the control of stored-product insects.

AB Polymeric nanocomposites polyaniline-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PAPV) and polyaniline-polyvinylpyrrolidone-neodymium/zinc oxide (PAPV-NZO) were synthesized for the effective dye removal through adsorption process. Neodymium doped zinc oxide (NZO) with various proportions of neodymium were prepared by chemical co-precipitation method and incorporated into the copolymer matrix via oxidative polymerization technique. NZO nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the morphological features, and functional group linkages of the PAPV-NZO were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. Acid red 52 dye was chosen as a synthetic toxic effluent to study the removal efficiency of the nanocomposites with different parameters viz. time, concentration, adsorbent dosage and pH. The studies were performed under visible light irradiation and the residual dye concentration was analyzed by UV-visible spectrophotometer. PAPV-NZO exhibited greater dye removal rate than PAPV due to the incorporation of NZO that enhanced the conducting nature, stability and surface area of PAPV-NZO. The optimum concentration of the dye and the adsorbent dosage of the PAPV-NZO were determined to be 80 ppm and 50 mg, respectively. At acidic condition of pH 2, the removal capacity of PAPV-NZO was found 99.6%. Kinetic and isotherm models have been studied on the optimum parameters to investigate the nature of the adsorption process. The process followed pseudo second order kinetics and was best suited to the Langmuir model. The maximum dye adsorption capacity of PAPV-NZO was estimated to be 159.36 mg g(-1). From the results, it can be assured that the PAPV-NZO can be effectively used for the removal of dye pollutants in water.

AB Wheat straw-supported Nanoscale Zero-Valent Iron particles (WS-NZVI) were successfully synthesized, which were used for Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CIP) removal in simulation wastewater. The structure, chemical composition and micro-morphology of WS-NZVI and Nanoscale Zero-Valent Iron (NZVI) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy analysis (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), as well as the Fourier Transformed IR spectra (FT-IR). XRD results proved the existence of Fe degrees, and SEM images indicated that the agglomeration of NZVI was effectively inhibited when loaded on wheat straw. Besides, the effects of initial solution pH, CIP concentration, adsorbents dosage and contacting time on the removal efficiency of CIP by WS-NZVI and NZVI were investigated. The experimental results showed that, compared with NZVI and wheat straw, WS-NZVI possessed higher removal efficiency for CIP, and the maximum removal capacity of CIP by WS-NZVI was 363.63 mg g(-1) (25 degrees C). Furthermore, WS-NZVI was suitable for wider pH range (pH = 4-10) in comparison with NZVI. For the WS-NZVI, the kinetic was better fitted with pseudo-second-order equation, rather than pseudo first-order equation. The Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis deduced that the degradation reaction mainly occurred on quinolone groups piperazinyl ring. Therefore, it is feasible that using wheat straw as a support material to enhance the performance of NZVI, and the synthesized WS-NZVI has a potential in the organic compounds elimination because of its redox reaction activity.

AB Muscle protein was one of critical accumulation protein for anthropogenic chemicals. However, few predictive models were constructed for muscle protein up to now. In addition, some ionizable chemicals classes e.g. sulfonates were not successfully modeled in previously models, indicating considerable work would be needed. The major objective of this study was to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the muscle protein-water partition coefficient (logK(MP/w)) of chicken and fish. In the modeling, the noctanol/water distribution coefficient (logD), functional groups, atom-centred fragments and chemical form adjusted descriptors were used to construct the models. The application domain of the derived models was defined by the Euclidean distance-based method and Williams plot. The modeling results indicated that the determination coefficient (R-2), leave-one out cross validation Q(2) (Q(LOO)(2)) and bootstrapping coefficient (Q(BOOT)(2)) of the QSAR models for chicken and fish were 0.882 and 0.929, 0.844 and 0.906, 0.779 and 0.792, respectively, implying the models had good goodness-of-fit and robustness. The coefficient determination (art) and external validation coefficient (Q(EXT)(2)) of the validation set for the two models were 0.874 and 0.937, 0.869 and 0.915, respectively, indicating the models had good predictive ability. The predictor variables selected to construct the logK(MP/w), models of chicken and fish included logD, the function groups, and the fraction of the ionized species (81). Considering the molecular descriptors used here can be calculated from their molecular structures directly, the developed models could be easily used to fill the logK(MP/w), data gap for other chemicals within the applicability domain.

AB Increased incidence of abiotic stresses impacting adversely plant growth and productivity in major crops is being witnessed all over the world. Therefore, as a result of such stress factors, plant growth under the stress conditions will be less than the non-stress conditions. Growing concerns and global demand for correct, environmentally friendly techniques exist to reduce the adverse effects of plant stress. Under such stressful conditions, the role of interactions of plant and beneficial microorganisms is of great significance. Application of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) is a useful option to decrease these stresses and is now widely in practice. Plants inoculated with PGPRs induce morphological and biochemical modifications resulting in increased tolerance to abiotic stresses defined as IST (induced systemic tolerance). PGPRs increase plant growth and resistance to abiotic stresses through various mechanisms (more than one mechanism of action) such as production of ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate) deaminase, reducing production of stress ethylene, modifications in phytohormonal content, induction of synthezing plant antioxidative enzymes, improvement in the uptake of essential mineral elements, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production, decrease in the absorbtion of excess nutrients/heavy metals, and induction of abiotic stress resistance genes. Experimental evidence also suggests that stimulated plant growth by these bacteria is the net result of various mechanisms of action that are activated simultaneously. In this review paper, we reviewed the action mechanisms through which PGPRs could alleviate abiotic stresses (salinity, drought, heavy metal toxicity, and nutritional imbalance) in plants. Use of PGPR5 is predicted to become a suitable strategy and an emerging trend in sustainable enhancement of plant growth. Generally, ACC deaminase and IAA-producing bacteria can be a good option for optimal crop production and production of bio-fertilizers in the future due to having multiple potentials in alleviating stresses of salinity, drought, nutrient imbalance, and heavy metals toxicity in plants. This review paper also emphasizes future research needs about the combined utilization of stress tolerant-PGPRs with multiple plant growth promoting (PGP) characteristics under environmental stresses.

AB House sparrows (Passer domesticus) have been proposed as a key ecological indicator of urban pollution. Remarkably, we lack knowledge about the physiological effects of lead on this bird species. Therefore, this study was aimed to evaluate the effect of Pb on several physiological parameters in house sparrows exposed to environmental Pb concentrations. In a first experiment, birds were exposed to Pb sub-lethal doses (from 1.3 to 14.0 mu g of Pb/g animal/day) during 5 days, which resulted in a dose response increase of blood Pb levels and decrease of blood ALAD activity. However, at the higher doses tested (> 7 mu g of Pb/g animal/day) the blood ALAD activity inhibition (similar to 82%) remained constant. Hematocrit and hemoglobin were significantly reduced only at the highest-doses, and the stress indicator, heterophils to lymphocyte (H/L) ratio, did not show apparent changes.
   In a second experiment, house sparrows were exposed to Pb in drinking water (12.3 ppm) during either 15 or 30 days. Pb concentration used in this study was enough to produce blood lead levels equivalents to those found recently in house sparrows inhabiting urban areas, reduced blood ALAD activity and inversion of the H/L ratio. Decreasing blood ALAD activities were correlated with increasing blood Pb levels. In addition, Pb exposure produced modification in the levels of hepatic antioxidant enzymes, increased GST activity and decreased CAT activity, without lipid peroxidation.
   In conclusion, our results suggest that blood ALAD activity is a reliable and sensitive biomarker for environmental Pb exposure in house sparrows, additionally chronic exposure produce physiological stress (H/L inversion) and small changes in antioxidant enzyme activity. Finally, this specie could be considered a bioindicator for monitoring the urban Pb contamination.

AB For biochemical assay of every enzyme including redox regulatory enzymes, any interfering small molecules (ISM) that may cross react with substrates or indirectly influence the reaction, must be removed. Such ISM(s) if present, need to be either neutralized or filtered out both from the sample or from the reaction mixture. This is a standard protocol adapted worldwide and fundamental rule in biochemistry. Without such approach, results obtained from a study that includes enzymatic assays seem to be inaccurate. Such inaccuracy raises question on the use of such data in future, especially as ecotoxic biomarkers. Tissue specific seasonal variation in natural titre of such ISM(s) in organisms leads to give rise counterfeit results. Such a case is highlighted in this correspondence article in relation to assay of redox regulatory enzymes including superoxide dismutase, catalase, especially the enzymes of glutathione system in presence of glutathione (GSH) in sample. This fact is discussed considering a recent publication doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.03.056 in which the authors have measured glutathione enzymes in tissues without removing GSH, that acts as ISM, from the sample. It is inferred that logical and sound scientific practices need to be followed for measuring biochemical activity of all enzymes in general and enzymes of glutathione system in particular. The main objective of this article was to make an alert in scientific society to avoid such mistakes in future.

AB Complexation is a main mechanism controlling the reactions between soil organic matter (SOM) and heavy metals, which still have not been fully understood up to date. The objective of this study was to compare the SOM composition of nonrhizosphere and rhizosphere in low Cr treatment with that in high Cr treatment and to find out how metal concentrations affect the complexation with SOM. The results revealed that both the hydroxyl and the carboxyl were significantly different under different Cr treatment groups. For nonrhizosphere samples, the high Cr treatment tended to have less hydroxyl contents and more structural changes on hydroxyl (3389-3381 cm(-1)) than the low Cr treatment (3389-3388 cm(-1)), while in the rhizosphere samples the reverse happened. The gap of the different Cr treated band area in the rhizosphere samples (44 a.u of the gap) was greatly smaller than that in the nonrhizosphere samples (576 a.u of the gap). In both the rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere samples, the high Cr treatment showed greater structural changes on carboxylic acids (11, 12 a.u changes based on the control) than the low Cr treatment (4, 6 a.u). The unsaturated carboxylic acids could account for downward frequency shift and the contents in the nonrhizosphere samples were slightly greater than that in the rhizosphere samples. This study used elemental analysis combined with FTIR spectroscopy to explore the effects of metal concentrations on the complexation of Cr with SOM and the composition of SOM. These findings give a way to understanding part of the complexation mechanisms between the metal and SOM.

AB Persistent organic products are compounds used for various purposes, such as personal care products, surfactants, colorants, industrial additives, food, pesticides and pharmaceuticals. These substances are constantly introduced into the environment and many of these pollutants are difficult to degrade. Toxic compounds classified as MoA 1 (Mode of Action 1) are low toxicity compounds that comprise nonreactive chemicals. In silico methods such as Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs) have been used to develop important models for prediction in several areas of science, as well as aquatic toxicity studies. The aim of the present study was to build a QSAR model-based set of theoretical Volsurf molecular descriptors using the fish acute toxicity values of compounds defined as MoA 1 to identify the molecular properties related to this mechanism. The selected Partial Least Squares (PIS) results based on the values of cross-validation coefficients of determination (Q(cv)(2)) show the following values: Q(cv)(2) = 0.793, coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.823, explained variance in extemal prediction (Q(ext)(2)) = 0.87. From the selected descriptors, not only the hydrophobicity is related to the toxicity as already mentioned in previously published studies but other physicochemical properties combined contribute to the activity of these compounds. The symmetric distribution of the hydrophobic moieties in the structure of the compounds as well as the shape, as branched chains, are important features that are related to the toxicity. This information from the model can be useful in predicting so as to minimize the toxicity of organic compounds.

AB Transgenerational effects, which involve both selection and plasticity, are important for the evolutionary adaptation of echinoderms in the changing ocean. Here, we investigated the effects of breeding design and water temperature for offspring on fertilization, hatchability, larval survival, size, abnormality and metamorphosis of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius, whose dams and sires were exposed to long-term (similar to 15 months) elevated temperature (similar to 3 degrees C above ambient) or ambient temperature. There was no transgenerational effect on fertilization and metamorphosis of S. intermedius, while negative transgenerational effects were found in hatchability and most traits of larval size. Dam and sire effects were highly trait and developmental stage dependent. Interestingly, we found S. intermedius probably cannot achieve transgenerational acclimation to long-term elevated temperature for survival provided their offspring were exposed to an elevated temperature. The present study enriches our understanding of transgenerational effects of ocean warming on sea urchins.

AB The river Yamuna is a major tributary of river Ganges and is a major source of freshwater in the National Capital Territory (NCT) catering 16.8 million people. This is the first report on occurrence, fate and ecotoxicological risk assessment of various pharmaceuticals active compounds (PhACs) in the Yamuna river. In this study, spatial and temporal distribution of nine PhACs "aspirin, ibuprofen, paracetamol, caffeine, ranitidine, diclofenac, carbamazepine, codeine, and diazepam", belonging to different therapeutic groups have been reported. Nine PhACs were analyzed in all the samples collected from the NCT stretch of river Yamuna. No specific trend in the distribution of the pharmaceutical residues was observed, however, the results revealed comparably higher PhACs contamination at YMN-2 (downstream Wazirabad, at this point, Najafgarh drain joins river Yamuna). Ecotoxicological risk assessment was carried out using Hazard quotients (HQ) for normal and worst case scenarios. The HQ showed that the levels of PhACs present in the samples were insufficient to cause acute toxicity to the flora and fauna of the river Yamuna. However, such residues could possibly cause chronic toxicity to the aquatic life and human beings as a huge amount of water of the river Yamuna is used for the drinking purposes in the NCT Delhi, the state capital of India.

AB The copepod Acartia tonsa was used as a model species to assess marine sediment quality. Acute and chronic bioassays, such as larval development ratio (LDR) and different end-points were evaluated. As a pelagic species, A. tonsa is mainly exposed to water-soluble toxicants and bioassays are commonly performed in seawater. However, an interaction among A. tonsa eggs and the first larval stages with marine sediments might occur in shallow water environments. Here we tested two different LDR protocols by incubating A. tonsa eggs in elutriates and sediments coming from two areas located in Tuscany Region (Central Italy): Livorno harbour and Viareggio coast. The end-points analyzed were larval mortality (LM) and development inhibition (DI) expressed as the percentage of copepods that completed the metamorphosis from nauplius to copepodite. Aims of this study were: i) to verify the suitability of A. tonsa copepod for the bioassay with sediment and ii) to compare the sensitivity of A. tonsa exposed to different matrices, such as water and sediment. A preliminary acute test was also performed. Acute tests showed the highest toxicity of Livorno's samples (two out of three) compared to Viareggio samples, for which no effect was observed. On the contrary, LDR tests with sediments and elutriates revealed some toxic effects also for Viareggio's samples. Results were discussed with regards to the chemical characterization of the samples. Our results indicated that different end-points were affected in A. tonsa, depending on the matrices to which the copepods were exposed and on the test used. Bioassays with elutriates and sediments are suggested and LDR test could help decision-makers to identify a more appropriate management of dredging materials.

AB Due to the progressive development of industrial and technological activities, heavy metal contamination is increasing each year and it poses a serious health and environmental risk. Microorganisms are capable of removing heavy metals from a contaminated environment. In this work, 51 microbial strains were isolated from heavy metal contaminated water and soil. The JAW1 strain, identified as Pseudomonas azotoformans, was selected and applied in bioremediation of the specific mixture of metals (Cd, Cu, and Pb) in an aqueous medium. The Box-Behnken design was used to optimize the biosorption process, with three factors: pH, initial metal concentration, concentration of the biosorbent. For the strain P. azotoformans JAW1, the optimal conditions were pH = 6.0, 25 mg/L of each metal and 2 g/L, following removal levels were achieved: Cd 44,67%; Cu 63,32%; Pb 78,23%. The possible interactions of cell-metal ions were evaluated using FT-IR analysis. The study indicated the presence of groups, which may be responsible for bonding of metal ions. The studies conducted on bioremediation mechanisms indicated that metal accumulation could occur on the cell surface (biosorption) where the amount of adsorbed metals reached: Cd 98,57%, Cu 69,76%, Pb 88,58%. P. azotoforrnans JAW1 exhibited a potential for application in the bioremediation of mining wastewater with complex metal contaminations.

AB Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) can be found in domestic sewage, wastewater treatment plant effluents, natural water, rivers, lakes and in the marine environment. Jurujuba Sound, located in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil, receives untreated sewage into its waters, one the main sources of aquatic contamination in this area. In this context, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the estrogenic potential of water sampled from different depths and from areas with differential contamination levels throughout Jurujuba Sound. Water quality was evaluated and acute toxicity assays using Allviibrio fischeri were conducted, while estrogenic activity of the water samples was determined by a Yeast Estrogen Screening assay (YES). Water quality was mostly within the limits established for marine waters by the Brazilian legislation, with only DOC and ammoniacal nitrogen levels above the maximum permissible limits. No acute toxicity effects were observed in the Allivibrio fisheri assay. The YES assay detected moderate estrogenic activity in bottom water samples from 3 sampling stations, ranging from 0.5 to 3.2 ng L-1, as well as in one surface water sample. Estrogenic activity was most frequently observed in samples from the bottom of the water column, indicating adsorption of estrogenic compounds to the sediment.

AB Cadmium (Cd) and drought stress in plants is a worldwide problem, whereas little is known about the effect of biochar (BC) under combined Cd and drought stress. The current study was conducted to determine the impact of BC on Cd uptake in wheat sown in Cd-contaminated soil under drought stress. Wheat was grown in a soil after incubating the soil for 15 days with three levels of BC (0%, 3.0% and 5.0% w/w). Three levels of drought stress (well-watered, mild drought and severe drought containing 70%, 50%, and 35% of soil water holding capacity respectively) were applied to 45-d-old wheat plants. Drought stress decreased plant height, spike length, chlorophyll contents, gas exchange parameters, root and shoot dry biomasses and grain yields. Drought stress also caused oxidative stress and decreased the antioxidant enzymes activities whereas increased the Cd concentration in plants. Biochar increased morphological and physiological parameters of wheat under combined drought and Cd stress and reduced the oxidative stress and Cd contents and increased antioxidant enzymes activities. The decrease in Cd concentration with BC application in drought-stressed plant might be attributed to BC-induced increase in crop biomass production and reduction in oxidative stress. These results indicate that BC could be used as an amendment in metal contaminated soil for improving wheat growth and reducing Cd concentrations under semiarid conditions.

AB Predicted climate change could impact the effects that various chemicals have on organisms. Increased temperature or change in precipitation regime could either enhance or lower toxicity of pesticides. The aim of this study is to assess how change in temperature and soil moisture affect biochemical biomarkers in Eisenia fetida earthworm and microbial activity in their excrements after exposure to a fungicide - propiconazole (PCZ) and an insecticide - chlorantraniliprole (CAP). For seven days, earthworms were exposed to the pesticides under four environmental conditions comprising combinations of two different temperatures (20 degrees C and 25 degrees C) and two different soil water holding capacities (30% and 50%). After exposure, in the collected earthworm casts the microbial activity was measured through dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and biofilm forming ability (BFA), and in the postmitochondrial fraction of earthworms the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) respectively. The temperature and the soil moisture affected enzyme activities and organism's response to pesticides. It was determined that a three-way interaction (pesticide concentration, temperature and moisture) is statistically significant for the CAT and GST after the CAP exposure, and for the AChE and CAT after the PCZ exposure. Interestingly, the AChE activity was induced by both pesticides at a higher temperature tested. The most important two-way interaction that was determined occurred between the concentration and temperature applied. DHA and BFA, as markers of microbial activity, were unevenly affected by PCZ, CAP and environmental conditions. The results of this experiment demonstrate that experiments with at least two different environmental conditions can give a very good insight into some possible effects that the climate change could have on the toxicity of pesticides. The interaction of environmental factors should play a more important role in the risk assessments for pesticides.

AB The work is a continuation of two previous studies in which biomarker fatty acids (12 of 56 FA pools) were analysed in Helix pomatia L. after heterogeneous micro-supplementation of Zn and Cu (administered in five micro-doses in the form of salts and EDTA and lysine chelates). This time, peroxidation (PI) and unsaturation coefficients (UI) as biomarker were analysed. These indices were calculated based on the FA profile in the foot and hepatopancreas of snails. The correlation of frequently used oxidation status indicators of organisms (catalase -CAT, glutathione peroxidase-GPx, selenium-dependent peroxidase-se-GPx, superoxide dismutase-SOD, glutathione transferase-GST, glutathione reductase-GR, glutathione-GSH, carbonyl protein-CP, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances-TBARS) with the rarely used UI and PI ratios was analysed. It was found that the 12-week micro-exposure to Zn and Cu did not inhibit but rather stimulated antioxidative defence at a sufficient level to increase the values of peroxidation/unsaturation indices in comparison to the control groups. Induction of an opposite process to oxidation of fatty acids was demonstrated. Maximum activities and amounts of antioxidants as well as minima of protein and lipid decomposition were recorded in groups supplemented with 0.75 mg/I Zn and 1.0 mg/I Cu. The possibility of a direct use of fatty acids as well as peroxidation/unsaturation indices as sensitive and reproducible biomarkers of exposure and oxidative physiological status in snails was confirmed.

AB Extremes of selenium (Se) exert toxic effects on plants' physiological processes; although plant species tolerate Se differently. This study focuses on the effect of Se (0, 20, 50 or 100 mu M sodium selenite) on secondary nitro oxidative stress processes mainly using in situ microscopic methods in non-accumulator Arabidopsis thaliana and secondary Se accumulator Brassica juncea. Relative Se tolerance or sensitivity of the species was evaluated based on growth parameters (fresh and dry weight, root growth) and cell viability. Besides, selenite-triggered cell wall modifications (pectin, callose) and stomatal regulations were determined for the first time. In case of Arabidopsis, relative selenite sensitivity was accompanied by decreased stomatal density and induced stomatal opening, callose accumulation, pronounced oxidative stress and moderate nitrosative modifications. In contrast, the selenite-treated, relatively tolerant Brassica juncea showed larger number of more opened stomata, pectin accumulation, moderate oxidative and intense nitrosative stress. These suggest that selenite tolerance or sensitivity is rather associated with oxidative processes than secondary nitrosative modifications in higher plants.

AB Old vineyards may present high copper (Cu) content in the soil due to the frequent application of Bordeaux fungicide to control leaf fungal diseases. Thus, many wine makers replace copper fungicides by those made of zinc (Zn) and it leads to the accumulation of these two elements in vineyard soils, fact that may potentiate the occurrence of physiological disorders and morphological changes in the plant root system. The aim of the current study was to assess the effects of high Cu and Zn contents in a sandy acid soil on the physiological state and development of the root system in young grapevines. The soil was taken from a vineyard from Southern Brazil, and then it was sieved and had its acidity and P and K contents corrected. Next, the soil was subjected to the application of 0 and 120 mg Cu kg(-1); each one of these doses was added with 0, 120 and 240 mg Zn kg(-1), thus totaling six treatments. After the treatments were added to the soil samples, 2.4 kg of soil was stored in rizobox-type containers. One young grapevine plant was transplanted to each box. The transplanted plants were cultivated for 60 days in greenhouse. The accumulation of root and shoot dry matter was set after the experimental period, as well as the Cu and Zn contents in the roots and shoot, the root system morphology, the chlorophyll a fluorescence, the photosynthetic pigments, the gas exchanges and the superoxide dismutase enzyme activity (SOD). Young grapevines presented mechanisms to tolerate high Cu and Zn concentrations in the soil, mainly through the retention of such metals in their roots to diminish translocation to the shoot. However, the highest Cu and Zn doses led to grapevine plant growth decrease, to gas exchange alterations and to photochemical efficiency reduction associated with photosynthetic pigment decrease and to non-photochemical energy dissipation increase. Moreover, the SOD activity was greater in intermediate Zn doses, thus indicating antioxidant system activation. Thus, the combination between high Cu and Zn concentrations in vineyard soils will enable minimizing the toxic effects of these metals to young grapevines cultivated in these soils.

AB The neurotoxic amino acid beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) has been implicated in the etiology of neuro-degenerative disorders. BMAA is also a known developmental neurotoxin and research indicates that the sources of human and wildlife exposure may be more diverse than previously anticipated. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine whether BMAA can be transferred into birds' eggs. Egg laying quail were dosed with C-14-labeled BMAA. The distribution of radioactivity in the birds and their laid eggs was then examined at different time points by autoradiography and phosphoimaging analysis. To evaluate the metabolic stability of the BMAA molecule, the distribution of C-14-methyl-and C-14-carboxyl-labeled BMAA were compared. The results revealed a pronounced incorporation of radioactivity in the eggs, predominantly in the yolk but also in the albumen. Imaging analysis showed that the concentrations of radioactivity in the liver decreased about seven times between the 24 h and the 72 h time points, while the concentrations in egg yolk remained largely unchanged. At 72 h the egg yolk contained about five times the concentration of radioactivity in the liver. Both BMAA preparations gave rise to similar distribution pattern in the bird tissues and in the eggs, indicating metabolic stability of the labeled groups. The demonstrated deposition into eggs warrants studies of BMAAs effects on bird development. Moreover, birds' eggs may be a source of human BMAA exposure, provided that the laying birds are exposed to BMAA via their diet.

AB The viability of spermatozoa is a crucial parameter to evaluate their quality that is an important issue in ecotoxicological studies. Here, a new method has been developed to rapidly determine the viability of spermatozoa in three marine invertebrates: the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and the mollusc Mytilus galloprovincialis. This method employed the dual DNA fluorescent staining coupled with spectrofluorimetric analysis. The dual fluorescent staining used the SYBR-14 stained live spermatozoa and propidium iodide stained degenerated cells that had lost membrane integrity. Stain uptake was assessed by confocal microscopy and then the percentage of live and dead spermatozoa was quantified by spectrofluorimetric analysis. The microscopic examination revealed three populations of spermatozoa: living-SYBR-14 stained, dead-PI stained, and dying-doubly stained spermatozoa. The fluorescence emission peak values recorded in a spectrofluorimeter provide the portion of live and dead spermatozoa showing a significant negative correlation. The stain combination was further validated using known ratios of live and dead spermatozoa.
   The present study demonstrated that the dual DNA staining with SYBR-14 and propidium iodide was effective in assessing viability of spermatozoa in marine invertebrates and that spectrofluorimetric analysis can be successfully employed to evaluate the percentage of live and dead spermatozoa. The method develop herein is simple, accurate, rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective, so it could be a useful tool by which marine pollutants may be screened for spermiotoxicity.

AB Batch sorption and leaching of arsenic (1-30 mg L-1) on Fe-sericite composite powder and beads were investigated in this study. Fe-sericite composite powder was made from natural sericite modified with iron, and alginate was used to transform the powder into beads. The maximum sorption capacities of the Fe-sericite composite powder (15.04 and 13.21 mg g(-1) for As(III) and As(V), respectively) were higher than those of the corresponding beads (9.02 and 7.11 mg g(-1) for As(III) and As(V), respectively) owing to the higher specific surface area of the powder. In addition, the leaching amounts of As(III) from Fe-sericite composite beads (<= 15.03%) were higher than those of the corresponding powder (<= 5.71%). However, acute toxicity of As(III)-sorbed Fe-sericite composite beads toward Daphnia magna was not significantly different from that of the corresponding powder (p > 0.05). Considering higher uptake of the powder particles by the daphnids, Fe-sericite composite beads seem to be a more appropriate and safer sorbent for arsenic removal in practical application. Based on Fe content, Fe-sericite composite beads had similar or higher maximum sorption capacities (71.19 and 56.11 mg g(-1) Fe for As(III) and As(V), respectively) than those of previously reported sorbents.

AB Leaching of hazardous trace elements from excavated urban soils during construction of cities has received considerable attention in recent years in Japan. A new concept, the pollution potential leaching index (PPLI), was applied to assess the risk of arsenic (As) leaching from excavated soils. Sequential leaching tests (SLT) with two liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratios (10 and 20 L kg(-1)) were conducted to determine the PPLI values, which represent the critical cumulative L/S ratios at which the average As concentrations in the cumulative leachates are reduced to critical values (10 or 5 mu g L-1). Two models (a logarithmic function model and an empirical two-site first-order leaching model) were compared to estimate the PPLI values. The fractionations of As before and after SLT were extracted according to a five-step sequential extraction procedure. Ten alkaline excavated soils were obtained from different construction projects in Japan. Although their total As contents were low (from 6.75 to 79.4 mg kg(-1)), the As leaching was not negligible. Different L/S ratios at each step of the SLT had little influence on the cumulative As release or PPLI values. Experimentally determined PPLI values were in agreement with those from model estimations. A five-step SLT with an L/S of 10 L kg(-1) at each step, combined with a logarithmic function fitting was suggested for the easy estimation of PPLI. Results of the sequential extraction procedure showed that large portions of more labile As fractions (non-specifically and specifically sorbed fractions) were removed during long-term leaching and so were small, but non-negligible, portions of strongly bound As fractions.

AB Elevated microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and ammonia (NH3-N) concentrations co-occur during the degradation of Microcystis blooms, and are toxic to aquatic organisms. The freshwater rotifer, Brachionus calyciflorus, was exposed to mixtures of MC-LR (0, 10, 30, and 100 mu g L-1) and NH3-N (0, 270, and 540 mu g L-1) to assess the combined effects of the two toxicants on reproductive performance and phenotype traits. Single solutions of MC-LR (100 mu g L-1) and NH3-N (540 mu g L-1) had negative effects on rotifer reproductive timing and fecundity. Pre and post-reproductive periods fluctuated with MC-LR and NH3-N concentrations, while reproductive period and total offspring per female were reduced in mixtures of MC-LR and NH3-N (p < 0.05). Grazing rate of rotifers decreased with grazing time and concentrations of the two toxicants (p < 0.001). MC-LR in combination with NH3-N had negative effects on swimming speed and body length but positively stimulated posterolateral spine development (p < 0.001). MC-LR and NH3-N had synergetic interactive effects on pre-reproductive period, reproductive period, total offspring per female, grazing rate, swimming speed, and body length (p < 0.05). In contrast, these effects were antagonistic on post-reproductive period and posterolateral spine length (p > 0.05). These results indicate that MC-LR and NH3-N act synergistically and antagonistically in causing toxicity to B. calyciflorus regarding reproductive performance and the formation of defensive phenotypes.

AB Soil microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a sustainable technology that degrades organic pollutants while generating electricity. However, there have been no detailed studies of the mechanisms of pollutant degradation in soil MFCs. In this study, the effects of external resistance and electrode effectiveness on atrazine and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) degradation were evaluated, the performance of soil MFCs in the degradation of these pollutants under different soil redox conditions was assessed, and the associated microorganisms in the anode were investigated. With an external resistance of 20 52, the degradation efficiencies of atrazine and HCB were 95% and 78%, respectively. The degradation efficiency, degradation rate increased with decreasing external resistance, while the half-life decreased. There were different degradation trends for different pollutants under different soil redox conditions. The fastest degradation rate of atrazine was in the upper MFC section (aerobic), whereas that of HCB was in the lower MFC section (anaerobic). The results showed that electrode effectiveness played a significant role in pollution degradation. In addition, the microbial community analysis demonstrated that Proteobacteria, especially Deltaproteobacteria involved in current generation was extremely abundant (27.49%) on soil MFC anodes, although the percentage abundances of atrazine degrading Rhodocyclaceae (8.77%), Desulfitobacteriurn (0.64%), and HCB degrading Desulfuromonas (0.73%), were considerably lower. The results of the study suggested that soil MFCs can enhance the degradation of atrazine and HCB, and bioelectrochemical reduction was the main mechanism for the pollutants degradation.

AB Duckweed is a potential alternative protein source for food and feed. However, little is known about the nitrate accumulation in this plant. A high nitrate level in vegetables can indirectly lead to an elevated intake of nitrites and N-nitroso compounds, increasing the risk of diseases for humans and animals. This research hypothesizes that the nitrate accumulation of Lemna minor differs between growing media. Additionally, it evaluates whether legal safety levels of nitrate for human and animal intake are exceeded. The duckweed was grown on (i) rainwater, and (ii) three synthetic media containing different nutrient levels. Furthermore, (iii) biological effluent of swine manure treatment and (iv) aquaculture effluent from pikeperch production were used, as these are potential media for closing nutrient loops in the agriculture sector. It was found that nitrate levels increased with the increasing availability of macronutrients in the water, and pH showed a particularly strong negative correlation with the nitrate levels in the plant. Nevertheless, nitrate content never exceeded 530 mg NO3 kg(-1) fresh weight. To conclude, Lemna minor's nitrate content was below safety limits for human consumption in all tested growing media; however, a potential risk for ruminants was observed as these are more sensitive to nitrate conversions in their gastro-intestinal track.

AB The potential toxicity of Cr to plants poses a severe threat to human health. Biochar and Se can reduce the absorption of Cr and its phytotoxicity in plants, but the associated mechanisms at subcellular levels have not been addressed in depth. A study was designed to investigate the effects of biochar, foliar application of Se, and their combination on the physicochemical and biological properties of the soil, Cr availability, Cr absorption, and Cr subcellular distribution in each part of the plant, and biomass and quality of two water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) genotypes. The results showed that biochar, Se, and their combination increased the organic matter content and available NPK nutrients in the soil and improved the urease, phosphatase, catalase, and sucrase activities in the soil. Furthermore, they also increased the number of bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi in the soil, were conducive to dry matter accumulation in I. aquatica, and increased the contents of soluble sugar and soluble protein in its leaves. The Cr contents in the roots and shoots of I. aquatica under different treatments were reduced compared with those in the control group. The content of Cr(VI) in the root-soil of I. aquatica with low Cr accumulation and the contents of Cr in various parts of I. aquatica were lower than those in I. aquatica with high Cr accumulation, and the absorbed Cr was mainly accumulated in the roots. Cr was mainly distributed in the cell walls and soluble fractions of the roots, stems, and leaves of I. aquatica and was less distributed in the organelles. Biochar and Se helped to increase the proportion of Cr in the cell walls of the roots and soluble fractions of the leaves of I. aquatica. The effects of improving the soil properties, passivating and inhibiting Cr absorption by I. aquatica, and reducing the Cr proportion in the organelles of biochar were superior to those of Se application. The foliar application of Se and biochar had no synergistic effect on inhibiting Cr absorption by I. aquatica. Based on these findings, the application of biochar in Cr-contaminated soil or foliar application of Se with low Cr-accumulating plants may be effective means of reducing the Cr absorption by plants and its toxicity to ensure the safe production of agricultural products in Cr-contaminated regions.

AB Living organisms are exposed to mixtures of pollutants in the wild. Inland aquatic ecosystems contain many compounds from different sources that pollute the water column and the sediment. However, majority of toxicological research is focused on the effects of single exposures to toxicants. Furthermore, studies have been principally oriented toward ecologically relevant effects of intoxication, and lack an analysis of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the response to toxicants. Effects of single, binary, and ternary mixtures of three compounds, bisphenol A, octocrylene, and 2'-ethylhexyl 4-(dimethylamino)benzoate, were assessed using a Real-Time PCR array. Forty genes, and additional six reference genes, were included in the array. The genes were selected based on their association with hormone responses, detoxification mechanisms, the stress response, DNA repair, and the immune system. The study was performed on Chironomus riparius, a benthic dipteran with an essential role in the food web. Transcriptional responses were assessed both 24 and 96 h post-exposure, to determinate short- and medium-term cellular responses. Individual fourth instar larvae were exposed to 0.1 and 1 mg/L of each of the toxic compounds and compound mixtures. A weak response was detected at 24 h, which was stronger in larvae exposed to mixtures than to individual toxicants. The response at 96 h was complex and principally involved genes related to the endocrine system, detoxification mechanisms, and the stress response. Furthermore, exposure to mixtures of compounds altered the expression patterns of an increased number of genes than did individual compound exposures, which suggested complex interactions between compounds affected the regulation of transcriptional activity. The results obtained highlight the importance of analyzing the mechanisms involved in the response to mixtures of compounds over extended periods and offer new insights into the basis of the physiological responses to pollution.

Although the individual toxicities of CB and heavy metals have been extensively studied, the combined toxicity is much less understood. In this study, we choose the nano carbon black (CBNPs) and Pb2+ to simulate fine particles in the atmosphere and study the combined toxic effect on rat alveolar macrophages. The data showed that CBNPs could adsorb Pb2+ to form CBNPs-Pb2+ complex and displayed an altered physical properties by particle characterization. CBNPs-Pb2+ synergistically induced rat alveolar macrophages apoptosis and blocked autophagy flux compared with CBNPs and Pb2+ individually. Consistent with this, CBNPs-Pb2+ could impair the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), activate apoptotic signaling pathways, inhibit lysosomal function.

AB Oil pollution is a serious international concern due to its harmful effect on human health and the environment. This study aims to investigate the effective factors on the biodegradation of Iranian heavy crude oil by Bacillus licheniformis. For this purpose, oil removal from the artificial seawater was studied by response surface methodology (RSM). After the screening experiments, pH (4-10), Had. concentration (0-10 g/L), and oil concentration (500-4500 ppm) were selected as influential factors. Moreover, to evaluate the bacterial capability in bioremediation of an actual polluted site, crude oil spill with a salinity of 35 g/L was experimentally simulated. The proposed model in this study clearly shows that both selected individual factors and their interactions are significantly effective on the crude oil biodegradation capacity. The results showed that Bacillus licheniformis was able to degrade crude oil at different concentrations of oil, especially at low concentrations, which are challenging in actual polluted sites. 15%-66% removal was achieved for 500-4500 ppm of crude oil after 14 days. Furthermore, according to the obtained results, this bacterium can tolerate the salinity up to 3.5%. At this salinity level, crude oil removal was 23.43 and 25.64% in neutral and alkaline conditions, respectively. Process factors were optimized, and 54.8% of crude oil was removed at optimum conditions i.e., 3500 ppm crude oil concentration, 2.5 g/L of NaCl and pH equal to 8.5. Finally, it can be concluded that the selected bacterium of this study can be more effective in harsh environments such as hypersaline and alkaline conditions.

AB In order to investigate and model toxicity and interactions between metals in mixtures, inhibition of wheat root elongation in response to additions of single-metals of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and nickel (Ni) and of binary mixed-metal combinations of Cu-Ni and Zn-Ni was tested, using water culture experiments under different Mg concentrations and pH values. A biotic ligand model (BLM) of single-metal Cu, Zn, and Ni was established. The results showed that the toxicity of Cu, Zn or Ni in isolation decreased with increasing Mg concentration whereas the effects of pH on Cu, Zn, or Ni toxicity were related not only to free Cu2+, Zn2+, and Ni2+ concentrations, but also to inorganic metal complexes. In binary mixtures, the two metals in the Cu-Ni mixture showed a weakly antagonistic effect, whereas the two metals in the Zn-Ni mixture showed greater antagonism. Using data from single-metal Cu, Zn, and Ni BLMs, combined with the toxicity index and the overall amounts of metal ions bound to the biotic ligands, one simple model was developed. This model consisted of the toxic unit (TUM, no competition included) and two extended BLMs, BLM-TUf (f as a function of TU, including competition between Mg2+ and metal ions) and BLMfmix (including the competition between Mg2+ and metal ions, as well as between free metal ions). They were then used to predict the joint toxicity of Cu-Ni and Zn-Ni binary mixtures to wheat. Both of the extended BLMs could provide more accurate predictions of toxic effects of Cu-Ni and Zn-Ni than TUM. BLM-f(mix) performed best for the Zn-Ni binary mixture (r(2) = 0.93; root-mean-square error, RMSE = 9.87). On the other hand, for the Cu-Ni mixture, the predictive effect based on BLM-TUf (r(2) = 0.93; RMSE = 9.60) was similar to that of BLMf(-mix) (r(2) = 0.93; RMSE = 9.56).

AB Pesticides can enter aquatic environments potentially affecting non-target organisms. Unfortunately, the effects of such substances are still poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of the active neonicotinoid substance thiacloprid (TH) and the commercial product Calypso 480 SC (CA) (active compound 40.4% TH) on Mytilus galloprovincialis after short-term exposure to sublethal concentrations. Mussels were tested for seven days to 0, 1, 5 and 10 mg L-1 TH and 0, 10, 50 and 100 mg L-1 CA. For this purpose, several parameters, such as cell viability of haemocytes and digestive cells, biochemical haemolymph features, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymatic activity of gills and digestive gland, as well as histology of such tissues were analysed. The sublethal concentrations of both substances lead to abatement or completely stopping the byssal fibres creation. Biochemical analysis of haemolymph showed significant changes (P < 0.01) in electrolytes ions (Cl-, K+, Na+, Ca2+, S-phosphor), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme activity and glucose concentration following exposure to both substances. The TH-exposed mussels showed significant imbalance (P < 0.05) in CAT activity in digestive gland and gills. CA caused significant decrease (P < 0.05) in SOD activity in gills and in CAT activity in both tissues. Results of histological analyses showed severe damage in both digestive gland and gills in a time and concentration-dependent manner. This study provides useful information about the acute toxicity of a neonicotinoid compound and a commercial insecticide on mussels. Nevertheless, considering that neonicotinoids are still widely used and that mussels are very important species for marine environment and human consumption, further researches are needed to better comprehend the potential risk posed by such compounds to aquatic non-target species.

AB Environmental nanomaterials contamination is a great concern for organisms including human. Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) are widely used in a huge range of applications which might pose potential risk to organisms. This study investigated the in vivo transgenerational toxicity on development and reproduction with parental CuO NPs exposure in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The results showed that CuO NPs (150 mg/L) significantly reduced the body length of parental C. elegans (P0). Only about 1 mg/L Cu2+ (similar to 0.73%) were detected from 150 mg/L CuO NPs in 0.5X K-medium after 48 h. In transgenerational assays, CuO NPs (150 mg/L) parental exposure significantly induced developmental and reproductive toxicity in non-exposed C. elegans progeny (CuO NPs free) on body length (F1) and brood size (F1 and F2), respectively. In contrast, parental exposure to Cu2+ (1 mg/L) did not cause transgenerational toxicity on growth and reproduction. This suggests that the transgenerational toxicity was mostly attributed to the particulate form of CuO NPs. Moreover, qRT-PCR results showed that the mRNA levels of met-2 and spr-5 genes were significantly decreased at P0 and F1 upon only maternal exposure to CuO NPs (150 mg/L), suggesting the observed transgenerational toxicity was associated with possible epigenetic regulation in C. elegans.

AB Quinclorac (3,7-dichloroquinoline-8-carboxylic acid, QNC) is a highly selective auxin herbicide that is typically applied to paddy rice fields. Its residue is a serious problem in crop rotations. In this study, Oryza sativa L. seedlings was used as a model plant to explore its biochemical response to abiotic stress caused by QNC and nZVI coexposure, as well as the interactions between QNC and nZVI treatments. Exposure to 5 and 10 mg/L QNC reduced the fresh biomass by 26.6% and 33.9%, respectively, compared to the control. The presence of 50 and 250 mg/L nZVI alleviated the QNC toxicity, but the nZVI toxicity was aggravated by the coexist of QNC. Root length was enhanced upon exposure to low or medium doses of both QNC and nZVI, whereas root length was inhibited under high-dose coexposure. Both nZVI and QNC, either alone or in combination, significantly inhibited the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, and the inhibition rate increased with elevated nZVI and QNC concentration. It was indicated that nZVI or QNC can affect the plant photosynthesis, and there was a significant interaction between the two treatments. Effects of QNC on the antioxidant response of Oryza sativa L. differed in the shoots and roots; generally, the introduction of 50 and 250 mg/L nZVI alleviated the oxidative stress (POD in shoots, SOD and MDA in roots) induced by QNC. However, 750 mg/kg nZVI seriously damaged Oryza sativa L. seedlings, which likely resulted from active iron deficiency. QNC could be removed from the culture solution by nZVI; as a result, nZVI suppressed QNC uptake by 20%-30%.

AB Fabrication of poly-(N-isopropylmethacrylamide-co-methacrylic acid) [p(NMA)] microgels to be utilized as microreactors to synthesize stable Ag nanoparticles for catalytic reductive degradation of dyes has been addressed in this work. Both p(NMA) microgel and Ag-p(NMA) hybrid microgel systems have been analyzed by Fourier transform infra-red and Dynamic light scattering, Ultraviolet-Visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Transmission electron microscopy. Catalytic activity of Ag-p(NMA) towards reductive degradation of Congo Red (CR), Methyl Orange (MO) and Alizarin Yellow (AY) was investigated under different operating conditions. Spectrophotometry was employed to check the progress of reaction while the rate constant (kapp) value of degradation reaction was determined under various conditions to optimize reaction parameters for rapid and economical degradation of these dyes. An increase in kapp value was observed by increasing feed content of dye up to a certain value that decreases again by further increment in dye concentration which reflects that catalysis follows Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. A gradual increase in the kapp value was also observed with increasing quantity of hybrid microgel used as a catalyst. By comparing kapp values of degradation of aforementioned dyes, it was found that Ag-p(NMA) hybrid microgel gives better activity for MO dye degradation in comparison to catalytic degradation of CR and AY.

AB Rare earth elements (REEs) are naturally distributed in the environment, and are increasingly being used in agriculture and high technology materials worldwide, thereby increasing anthropogenic contamination and environmental risks. There exists scarce and contradictory toxicity information about REEs; hence, more studies are required, especially on their mixtures. Thus, this study aimed to assess the toxicities of La3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, and the combinations of these elements (binary 1:1 and ternary 1:1:1), to organisms from different trophic levels: producers (the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris and Raphidocelis subcapitata), primary consumers (the microcrustaceans Daphnia similis and Anemia salina), and decomposers (the fungi Penicillium simplicissimum and Aspergillus japonicus). Ecotoxicological bioassays were performed, and toxic concentrations were determined. Thereafter, toxicities of single and mixture REEs were classified as slightly to highly toxic according to their toxic units. Finally, a concentration addition (CA) model was used to estimate how REEs interact upon combining. Nd3+ was the most toxic element for all organisms, especially D. similis (48 h LC50 9.41 mg.L-1 ), and was therefore classified as highly toxic. Sm s+ promoted cell agglomeration in Chlorella vulgaris and was the most toxic of the tested elements for this organism (72 h IC50 25.78 mg.L-1). The CA model revealed synergistic responses for most of the combinations, principally Nd3+ + Sm3+, which was the most toxic combination for the tested organisms. Both fungi were the most resistant organisms, and A. japonicus produced exudate and sclerotia, which help in the detoxification of chemicals. Owing not only to the fact that fungi displayed a higher resistance to REEs, but also due to the absence of regulations for REEs released from the agricultural or industrial sector, and the lack of methods to treat effluents or to dispose of technological items containing REEs, these organisms should be considered as a model for the biosorption or bioremediation of REEs. Finally, the toxic effects of REEs, particularly Nd3+, on the biota and human health should be the focus of future studies due to their increased use in technology.

AB The intensive use of glyphosate in industrial agriculture may lead to freshwater contamination, encouraging studies of its toxic effect on non-target aquatic organisms. Glyphosate-based commercial formulations contain adjuvants, making them even more toxic than the active ingredient (a.i.) itself. The golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei is a freshwater invasive species which has been found to increase glyphosate dissipation in water and to accelerate eutrophication. The aim of this study is to evaluate the capability of L. fortunei to reduce the concentration of glyphosate in two commercial formulations, Roundup Max (R) and Glifosato Atanor (R). Results were compared with the decay of the a.i. alone and in presence of mussels. Evasive response and toxicity tests were performed in a first set of trials to analyze the response of L. fortunei exposed to Roundup Max (R) and Glifosato Atanor (R). Subsequently, we conducted a 21-day degradation experiment in 2.6-L microcosms applying the following treatments: 6 mg L-1 of technical-grade glyphosate (G), Glifosato Atanor (R) (A), Roundup Max (R) (R), 20 mussels in dechlorinated tap water (M), and the combination of mussels and herbicide either in the technical-grade (MG) or formulated form (MA and MR) (all by triplicate). Samples were collected at days 0, 1, 7, 14 and 21. No significant differences in glyphosate decay were found between treatments with mussels (MG: 2.03 +/- 0.40 mg L-1; MA: 1.60 +/- 0.32 mg L-1; MR: 1.81 +/- 0.21 mg L-1), between glyphosate as a.i. and the commercial formulations, and between the commercial formulations, suggesting that the adjuvants did not affect the degrading potential of L. fortunei. In addition to the acceleration of glyphosate dissipation in water, there was an increase in the concentration of dissolved nutrients in water (N-NH4+ and P-PO43-) even higher than that caused by the filtering activity of the mussels, probably resulting from stress or from the degradation of glyphosate and adjuvants. We believe that a larger bioavailability of these nutrients due to glyphosate metabolization mediated by mussels would accelerate eutrophication processes in natural water bodies.

AB Exposure to the heavy metal cadmium (Cd) in the environment is linked to adverse health. To fully understand the adverse effects of this important endocrine-disrupting compound (EDC) requires studies that address multigenerational effects and epigenetic mechanisms. The present study orally dosed pregnant SD rats with Cd from gestation day 1 until birth. First filial generation (F1) female rats were mated with untreated males to generate the secondary filial generation (F2). Ovarian granulosa cells (OGCs) were collected at postnatal day (PND) 56 from both generations after prenatal Cd exposure, and hormone secretion examinations showed a progesterone disorder. Significant decreases in steroidogenic enzymes (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1)) were observed in F1 and F2 rats. However, F1 and F2 rats had different patterns of mRNA and protein expression of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). We also found that microRNAs were significantly changed using a microarray, and miR-10b-5p and miR-27a-3p were upregulated in F1 and F2 rats. The COV434 cell line microRNA-knockdown model showed that these two important microRNAs regulated the StAR-induced Cd effect on progesterone secretion. Overall, the results of this study indicate that prenatal Cd exposure causes cytotoxicity problems, progesterone disorder and microRNAs expression changed in a multigenerational manner. And progesterone disorder may interfere with the steroidogenic enzymes in offspring. The present study also revealed that environmental pollution produces multigenerational effects.

AB Batch experiments were conducted to examine the differential effects of biochar pyrolysis temperature and low-molecular-weight organic acids on the reduction of As(V) and Cr(VI) driven by Pennisetum hydridum biochar. The results showed that pyrolysis temperature significantly affected the reducing strength of the biochar. Biochar produced at 500 degrees C had a stronger electron-donating capacity than did the biochars produced at 300 and 700 degrees C. In the co-presence of the biochar and a low-molecular-weight organic acid, arsenic and chromium behaved differently. Oxalic acid and malic acid tended to have better effects on enhancing biochar-driven Cr(VI) reduction, as compared to citric acid while the opposite was observed for biochar-driven As(V) reduction. Biochar produced at 300 degrees C was more favourable for Cr(VI) reduction, as compared to the higher-temperature biochars while the opposite was observed for As(V) reduction in the presence of low-molecular-weight organic acids. This may make the lower-temperature biochar ideal for remediating contaminated soils containing both As(V) and Cr (VI) since it could maximize Cr(VI) reduction while minimizing As(V) reduction.

AB An oral painless dietary therapy is also indispensable in the management of arsenic toxicity despite of its conventional painful therapeutic management. The present study focused on the management of arsenic mediated female reproductive dysfunctions by dietary therapy of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Here, sodium arsenite was given at the dose of 10 mg/kg body weight orally for the first 8 day. Day 9 onwards up to day 16 these arsenicated rats were provided with NAC (250 mg/kg body weight) enriched basal diet once daily. Arsenic intoxicated group exhibited a comparable inactivation of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) due to oxidative stress in reproductive organs along with a simultaneous elevation of lipid peroxidation state and decline in nonprotein soluble thiols (NPSH) level in female reproductive organs. Arsenic intoxication also accomplished with the up-regulation of inflammatory markers tumour necrosis factor (TNF alpha) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B). Pro-apoptotic Bax gene and p53 gene expressions were also raised due to arsenic intoxication while antiapoptotic Bcl-2 gene expression was suppressed. In fact, arsenication decreased the circulating level of vitamin B-12 and folic acid. Dietary NAC supplementation significantly reversed back the activity of antioxidant enzymes in arsenite fed rats towards normalcy and also sustained the normal reproductive cyclicity, uteroovarian histo-morphology and estradiol receptor a (ER-alpha) expression in these reproductive organs. Dietary NAC exerted its positive action against arsenic intoxication by up-regulation of Bcl-2 gene expression along with the suppression of pro-apoptotic Bax gene and p53 gene. Thus, dietary NAC also plays anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative role against arsenic toxicity. NAC also regulates the components (vitamin B-12 and folic acid) of S-adenosylmethionine pool in the way of probable removal of arsenic from the system.

AB With the extensive use of ionic liquids (ILs) in various industrial fields, their potential toxicity to aquatic ecosystem has attracted considerable attention. In this work, biotoxicity of ILs with different cations and anions was evaluated by using a freshwater green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa. Results showed that 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C(4)mim]Cl), 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C(8)mim]Cl), 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate ([C(8)mim]NO3), 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C(8)mim]BF4), and 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C(12)mim]Cl) had a significant inhibition on the algal growth with EC50 values of 23.48, 4.72, 3.80, 4.44, and 0.10 mg L-1 at the 72 h of exposure, respectively. These data suggested that the toxicity of ILs increased with the increase of side alkyl chain length, while anions had little influences on their toxicity to this alga. Moreover, changes in chlorophyll a content and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (F-v/F-m and Phi(PSII)) indicated that the five ILs could damage the photosynthetic system of this alga resulting in the decrease of photosynthetic efficiency. The increased soluble protein content and antioxidase activity could be considered as an active response mechanism of this alga against the exposure of ILs. Content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in this alga increased significantly when it was exposed to ILs, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were accumulated in the algal cells, which would cause injury of the algal biofilm and chloroplast. Therefore, results obtained in this work would help to explain the possible underlying toxic mechanisms of ILs to C. pyrenoidosa, and provide a significant theoretical support for assessing the toxicity of ILs to aquatic organisms.

AB Consumption of rice and rice products can be a significant exposure pathway to inorganic arsenic (iAs), which is a group 1 carcinogen to humans. The UK follows the current European Commission regulations so that iAs concentrations must be < 0.20 mg kg(-1) in white (polished) rice and < 0.25 mg kg(-1) in brown (unpolished) rice. However, iAs concentration in rice used for infant food production or direct consumption has been set at a maximum of 0.1 mg kg(-1). In this context, this study aimed to evaluate iAs concentrations in different types of rice sold in the UK and to quantify the health risks to the UK population. Here, we evaluated 55 different types of rice purchased from a range of retail outlets. First, we analysed all rice types for total As (tAs) concentration from which 42 rice samples with tAs > 0.1 mg kg(-1) were selected for As speciation using HPLC-ICP-MS. Based on the average concentration of iAs of our samples, we calculated values for the Lifetime Cancer Risk (LCR), Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) and Margin of Exposure (MoE). We found a statistically significant difference between organically and non-organically grown rice. We also found that brown rice contained a significantly higher concentration of iAs compared to white or wild rice. Notably, 28 rice samples exceeded the iAs maximum limit stipulated by the EU (0.1 mg kg(-1)) with an average iAs concentration of 0.13 mg kg(-1); therefore consumption of these rice types could be riskier for infants than adults. Based on the MoE, it was found that infants up to 1 year must be restricted to a maximum of 20 g per day for the 28 rice types to avoid carcinogenic risks. We believe that consumers could be better informed whether the marketed product is fit for infants and young children, via appropriate product labelling containing information about iAs concentration.

AB Meteorological conditions during pregnancy can affect birth outcome, which has been linked to the H19/H19-differentially methylated region (DMR). However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this association are unclear. This was investigated in the present study to provide epidemiological evidence for elucidating the pathogenesis of adverse birth outcomes. A total of 550 mother-newborn pairs were recruited in Zhengzhou, China from January 2010 to January 2012. Meteorological data including temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and sunshine duration (SSD) were obtained from the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System. Bisulfite sequencing PCR was performed to determine the methylation levels of H19/H19-DMR using genomic DNA extracted from maternal peripheral and umbilical cord blood. The results showed that H19-DMR methylation status in cord blood was positively associated with that in maternal blood. Neonatal H19-DMR methylation was negatively associated with T and RH during the first trimester and positively associated with these variables during the third trimester. There was a positive correlation between neonatal H19-DMR methylation and SSD during the second trimester and a negative correlation during the third trimester. Similar associations were observed between maternal H19-DMR methylation and prenatal meteorological conditions. We also observed significant interaction effects of maternal H19/H19-DMR methylation and most prenatal meteorological factors on neonatal methylation, and found that changes in the methylation status of maternal H19-DMR were responsible for the effects of prenatal meteorological conditions on neonatal methylation. In summary, neonatal H19-DMR methylation was significantly associated with prenatal meteorological conditions, which was modified and mediated by maternal H19-DMR methylation changes. These findings provide insights into the relationship between meteorological factors during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes or disease susceptibility in offspring, and can serve as a reference for environmental policy-making.

AB T-2 toxin is a kind of group A trichothecenes mycotoxins, frequently detected in various foods and feeds, having high toxic effects on both humans and animals. The present study aims to investigate the toxic effects of T-2 toxin exposure to ICR mice during pregnancy and lactation on liver glycolipid metabolism of young mice. The pregnant mice were given 0, 0.005 and 0.05 mg of T-2 toxin/kg bw daily through oral gavage from late gestation (GD 14) to the lactation (LD 21). Liver and serum samples of the young mice were collected on postnatal day 21 (PND 21), PND 28 and PND 56. The results showed that T-2 toxin increased the contents of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (T-CHO) and glucose in serum of young mice on PND 21 and PND 28. In addition, obvious lipid droplets of liver in T-2 toxin treatment groups were observed, especially in 0.05 mg group of PND 21 and PND 28. Compared with the control group, T-2 treatment also increased the expressions of genes associated with liver glycolipid metabolism, such as PEPCK, Glut2, Fas, Acox1, Hmgcr, PPARa, Srebp1 and CD36. These results demonstrated T-2 toxin exposure to pregnant mice could cause liver glycolipid metabolism disruption in the young mice and the toxic effects weakened on PND 56.

AB Two arsenic (As) hyper-tolerant bacterial strains NM01 Paracoccus versutus and NM04 Aeromonas caviae were isolated from As polluted site of West Bengal, India. The strains not only possess the potential to tolerate up to 20,000 mgl(-1) As(V) and 10,000 mgl(-1) As(III) but also possess plant growth promoting (PGP) traits like phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, IAA production. Greenhouse pot experiments were conducted to assess the effect of rhizospheric inoculation of both the strains individually and in consortia in As accumulation by Adiantum capillus-veneries. It was observed that the microbial inoculation significantly (p < 0.05) increased the synthesis of thiolic compounds and thus, enhanced As accumulation with translocation factor (TF) > 1. The strains regulated endogenous phytohormone up to 90% and 77.9% increase in auxin of consortia inoculated root and shoot, respectively. Interestingly, inoculation of the isolated strains augmented rhizospheric microbial diversity which was negatively affected by heavy metal. The results of high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing technique to observe the composition of the bacterial community revealed 11,536 unique bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from As + S (non-inoculated), whereas 11,884 from Consortia As + S (inoculated) rhizospheric soil samples. Inoculated soil displayed higher bacterial diversity indices (ACE and Chao 1) with the dominant bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Our results highlight the innate PGP abilities of the strains and its potential to facilitate phytoextraction by enhancing As accumulation in the shoot.

AB Rapid industrialization and urbanization have resulted in serious environmental deterioration, especially in terms of heavy metal contamination in soil. Arsenic is one of the primary heavy metal contaminants in the soil and possesses a severe threat to all the plants and animals including humans. The conventional methods for analyzing arsenic contamination in soil have tedious, time-consuming sample preparation steps and require laboratory equipped instruments and skilled personnel. The present work demonstrates a novel method for arsenic As(III) detection in the contaminated soil based on field applicable sample preparation and smartphonebased optical sensing. Soil sample preparation has been simplified and optimized using acid extraction and serial application of different solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges for the removal of interfering ions with high arsenic yield in one step. The acidic extraction and SPE efficiencies were found to be 35.4% and 54.0%, respectively, for arsenic contaminated field soil samples. The quantification of As(III) was performed by aptamerAuNPs based colorimetric assay with a smartphone coupled optical unit. This aptasensor integrated detection system (ADS) has shown a detection limit of 14.44 ppb for aqueous samples and 1.97 ppm for field soil samples. In the accuracy comparison with ICP-MS, arsenic contaminated field soils from various sources have been tested and the results depicted a highly significant correlation coefficient of 0.997 with an average difference of 1.67 ppm. By integrating all the required analytical steps into a portable format, the presented setup enables onsite tests of arsenic contamination in soil.

AB This study aimed to further understand the toxicity of high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to plants, especially to plant photosynthesis. Tobacco plants in the six-leaf stage were exposed to 16.0 mu L L-1 NO2 to determine the activities of photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) reaction centers, the blocking site of PSII electron transport, the degree of membrane peroxidation and the relative expression of PsbA, PsbO and PsaA genes in the third fully expanded leaves by using gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence techniques, biochemical and RT-PCR analysis. The results showed that 16.0 mu L L-1 NO2 caused necrotic lesions to form on leaves and significantly increased the generation rate of superoxide anions (O-2(-)) and the content of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) in leaves of tobacco seedling, leading to damage to cell membrane, chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate reduction, and photosynthetic apparatus destruction. Fumigation with 16.0 mu L L-1 NO2 decreased the activity of PSII reaction center and oxygen evolution complex, and the relative expression of PabA in leaves of tobacco seedlings to inhibit the electron transport from the donor side to the receptor side of PSII, especially blocking the electron transport from QA to QB on the receptor side. The activity of the PSI reaction center and the relative expression of PsaA decreased, weakening the ability to accept electrons and inhibiting the electron transfer from PSII to PSI, which further increased the damage of PSII of tobacco seedling leaves caused by 16.0 mu L L-1 NO2. Therefore, 16.0 mu L L-1 NO2 leaded to the accumulation of O-2(-) and ONOO-, which damaged the cell membrane and thylakoid membrane, inhibit the electron transport, and destroyed the photosynthetic apparatus in leaves of tobacco seedlings. The results from this study emphasized the importance of reducing the NO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

AB Arsenic (As) is a pollutant of major concern worldwide, posing as a threat to both human health and the environment. Phytoremediation has been proposed as a viable mechanism to remediate As-contaminated soil environments. Pot experiments were performed to evaluate the phytoextraction efficiency of As by Pteris vittata, a known As hyperaccumulating fern, from soil amended with different concentrations of arsenate [As(V)] and arsenite [As(III)], the more common, inorganic As forms in soil. The greatest accumulation of As (13.3 +/- 0.36 g/kg Dwt) was found in fronds of plants grown in soil spiked with 1.0 g As(V)/kg. The maximum As-bioaccumulation factor (27.3 +/- 1.9) was achieved by plants grown in soil amended with 0.05 g As(V)/kg. A total of 864 bacterial cultures were isolated and examined for their ability to enhance phytoremediation of Ascontaminated soils. Traits examined included tolerance to As (III and V), production of siderophores, and/or ability to solubilize calcium phosphate and indole acetic acid (IAA) production. A culture-based survey shows greater numbers of viable and As-resistant bacteria were found in the rhizosphere of As-grown plants compared to bulk and unplanted soils. The percentage of bacteria resistant to As(V) was greater (P < 0.0001) than those resistant to As(III) in culture medium containing 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 g As/L. Higher (P < 0.0001) percentages of siderophore producing (77%) and phosphate solubilizing (61%) bacteria were observed among cultures isolated from unplanted soil. About 5% (44 of 864) of the isolates were highly resistant to both As (III) and As (V) (2 g/L), and were examined for their As-transformation ability and IAA production. A great proportion of the isolates produced IAA (82%) and promoted As (V)-reduction (95%) or As(III)-oxidation (73%), and 71% exhibited dual capacity for both As(V) reduction and As(III) oxidation. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that 67, 23, and 10% of these isolates belonged to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes, respectively. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences confirmed that these isolates were closely related to 12 genera and 25 species of bacteria and were dominated by members of the genus Pseudomonas (39%). These results show that these isolates could potentially be developed as inocula for enhancing plant uptake during large scale phytoremediation of As-impacted soils.

AB In the recent decade, the hydroelectric reservoir is identified as a methylmercury (MeHg) hotspot and gained much attention. The artificial water level management in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China formed a water-level-fluctuation zone (WLFZ) undergoing flooding drying rotations annually. However, the mercury (Hg) methylation and major geochemical driving factors at different elevations in the WLFZ remain unclear. Here we use total Hg (Hg-T) normalized MeHg (MeHg/Hg-T ratio) to evaluate Hg methylation degree in a one-year field study at 155, 165 m elevations in the WLFZ and with > 175 m elevation as the reference. Results demonstrate that MeHg/Hg-T ratio at the WLFZ could reach 4.1% in soils, and both 155 and 165 m elevations have a higher Hg methylation degree than the > 175 m elevation. However, the differences in MeHg/Hg-T ratios both in soils and waters between 155 and 165 m elevations are not significant. This indicates the influence of different submerging periods on the MeHg/Hg-T at the WLFZ elevations is not observed. The significant correlation between the MeHg/Hg-T ratio and soil organic carbon (SOC) content implies a MeHg retention in re-exposed soils after flooding. Decoupling of MeHg/Hg-T ratios between submerged soil and overlying water are found at both elevations and therefore make MeHg/Hg-T in waters alone cannot be used to evaluate Hg methylation degree in this study. The calculation of Hg T and MeHg partitioning coefficient (K-d) found an immobilization of MeHg by submerged soils at the WLFZ during the flooding period. Major geochemical factors, determined through principal component analysis (PCA), in affecting Hg methylation are the redox cycling of sulfur and the distribution of organic matters in the WLFZ.

AB Electrolytic manganese residue (EMR) contains a large amount of NH4+-N and Mn2+ and can negatively impact the environment. A stabilization treatment of soluble contaminants in the EMR is necessary for its reuse and safe stacking. This study presents experimental results for the stabilization of NH4+-N and Mn2+ in the EMR using phosphogypsum leachate as a low-cost phosphate source and MgO/CaO (PLMC) process. The results demonstrated that the stabilization efficiency of NH4+-N and Mn2+ was 93.65% and 99.99%, respectively, under the following conditions: a phosphogypsum leachate dose of 1.5 mL g(-1), an added MgO dose of 0.036 g g(-1), an added CaO dose of 0.1 g g(-1) and a reaction time of 2 h. The stabilization effect of the PLMC process was higher and more cost effective than that of using Na3PO4 center dot 12H(2)O and MgO/CaO. The concentration of NH4+-N and Mn2+ in the leaching liquor decreased to 80 mg L-1 and 0.5 mg L-1, respectively, after the stabilization under the optimum conditions. The stabilization characteristics indicated that NH4+-N was stabilized to form NH4MgPO4 center dot 6H(2)O (struvite) and that Mn2+ was stabilized to form Mn-5(PO4)(2)(OH)(4), Mn-3(PO4)(2)center dot 3H(2)O and Mn (OH)(2). PO43--P, F-, and heavy metal ions of the phosphogypsum leachate were removed from the leaching liquor and stabilized in the treated EMR.

AB Polymetal dust is a common industrial pollutant. While the use of remediation filters and equipment in lead smelters has reduced pollutant emission, surrounding areas remain contaminated due to the long-term transfer of heavy metals along the food chain. Here we assess the mutagenic potential of the lead-zinc smelter near Plovdiv (Bulgaria) situated in an area that has been contaminated with heavy metals for 60 years. We aimed to evaluate the genomic response of the yellow-necked mouse (A. flavicollis), a biomonitor species, in three sampling sites along the pollution gradient. Mice from Strandzha Natural Park were used as a negative control. The bioaccumulation rate of two non-essential heavy metals, lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd), in liver tissues was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Genetic alterations attributable to chronic exposure to trace levels of heavy metals were assessed in different blood cell populations using two independent methods: a micronucleus test was applied to evaluate the clastogenic and aneugenic alterations in erythrocytes, while a comet assay was used to assess DNA instability, as evidenced by single- and double-stranded breaks and alkali-labile sites, in leucocytes. We observed elevated levels of Pb and Cd in livers derived from mice from the impacted area: the mean Pb concentration (21.38 +/- 8.77 mu g/g) was two-fold higher than the lowest-observed-adverse-effect levels (LOAELs), while the mean Cd concentration (13.95 +/- 9.79 mu g/g) was extremely close to these levels. The mean levels of Pb and Cd in livers derived from mice from the impacted area were 31-fold and 63-fold higher, respectively, than the levels measured in mice from the control area. The mean frequency of micronuclei was significantly higher (four-fold) than that observed in the control animals. Furthermore, parameters measured by the comet assay, % tail DNA, tail length and tail moment, were significantly higher in the impact area, indicating the degree of genetic instability caused by exposure to heavy metals. In conclusion, this study shows that despite the reported reduction in lead and cadmium emissions in Bulgaria in recent years, A. flavicollis individuals inhabiting areas subject to long-term contamination exhibit significant signs of DNA damage.

AB Cadmium (Cd) and nickel (Ni) in soil have caused serious environmental problems and increased healthy risks to humans and biota, it is vital important and necessary to develop effective methods to resolve the combined contaminated problems. In this study, strains L5 and L6 with good heavy metal resistant and immobilizing capacities were isolated from Cd and Ni contaminated soil. Bacterial characteristic experiment illustrated that many functional groups (-OH, -NH2 and -COO et al.) were distributed on the surface of 1.5 and L6. Under the stress of heavy metals, bacterial appearances were distorted. The pot experiment indicated that the concentrations of HOAc-extractable Cd and Ni in soil reduced 6.26-15.33% and 13.31-19.53% with the inoculation of L5 and L6. In addition, the immobilization rates on Cd and Ni improved 61.27-128.50% and 23.69-39.66% with re-inoculation of strains L5 and L6 at 30 days, respectively. After inoculation of strains L5 and L6 for 60 days, the activities of FDA hydrolysis, acid phosphatase, urease, invertase and dehydrogenase in soil increased obviously. Furthermore, bacterial diversity indexes and community structure of soil were also improved. Thus, given the beneficial remediation effects of the isolated strains, L5 and L6 have great potentials for heavy metals contaminated soil remediation.

AB Fractions, bioavailability, health risks of fine particulate maters (PM2.5)-bound potentially toxic elements (PTEs) (Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu and Zn) were investigated before and after coal limiting in Baoding city. The winter PM2.5 samples were collected at different functional areas such as residential area (RA), industrial area (IA), suburb (SB), street (ST) and Botanical Garden Park (BG) in 2016 (coal dominated year) and 2017 (gas dominated year). The fractions and bioavailability of PTEs were determined and evaluated based on BCR sequential extraction. Health risks through inhalation exposure were evaluated by US EPA health risk assessment model. The results from different years and functional areas were compared and discussed. The fractions and bioavailability of PM2.5-bound PTEs varied with functional areas. The percentages of cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) in acid-soluble fraction (F1-Cd and F1-Zn) to the total amount of Cd and Zn were low in BG samples (p < 0.05). Bioavailability of Cd were high in SB samples (p < 0.05). Total contents of PM-bound PTEs in 2017 generally decreased compared with 2016. The differences of fraction and bioavailability between 2016 and 2017 depended on the elements and areas. Higher proportions of copper (Cu) in acid-soluble fraction (F1-Cu) and bioavailability of Cu (p < 0.05) were found in 2017 samples. Significant differences were found just at IA and RA for Pb, Cd and Zn. Our results indicated that the health risks from inhalation exposure for PTEs in PM2.5 declined about 11%-52% after the coal limiting in this city.

AB Mercury chloride (HgCl2) is a chemical pollutant widely found in the environment. This form of mercury is able to promote several damages to the Central Nervous System (CNS), however the effects of HgCl2 on the spinal cord, an important pathway for the communication between the CNS and the periphery, are still poorly understood. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of HgCl2 exposure on spinal cord of adult rats. For this, animals were exposed to a dose of 0.375 mg/kg/day, for 45 days. Then, they were euthanized, the spinal cord collected and we investigated the mercury concentrations in medullary parenchyma and the effects on oxidative biochemistry, proteomic profile and tissue structures. Our results showed that exposure to this metal promoted increased levels of Hg in the spinal cord, impaired oxidative biochemistry by triggering oxidative stress, mudulated antioxidant system proteins, energy metabolism and myelin structure; as well as caused disruption in the myelin sheath and reduction in neuronal density. Despite the low dose, we conclude that prolonged exposure to HgCl2 triggers biochemical changes and modulates the expression of several proteins, resulting in damage to the myelin sheath and reduced neuronal density in the spinal cord.

AB A three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) model was established based on molecular structures and docking scores (representing the biodegradability); the scores were obtained for 23 fluoroquinolones (FQs) and the oxidoreductase (PDB ID: 1YZP) of Phanerochaete chrysosporium in the aerobic process of municipal wastewater treatment plants. In the Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) model, q(2) was 0.516 and r(pred)(2), a was 0.727, which showed that the model was reliable and robust. The modification information obtained by the contour maps showed that introducing electronegative, bulky or electropositive groups at different active sites could increase the biodegradability of fluoroquinolone derivatives. Using levofloxacin (LEV) as a modified molecule, 35 fluoroquinolone derivatives with higher biodegradability than LEV were designed. After the evaluation of genotoxicity, bioconcentration and photodegradation, Derivative-15, with higher biodegradability (increased by 27.85%), higher genotoxicity, higher photodegradation and lower bioconcentration, was identified as the most environmentally friendly fluoroquinolone derivative. The 2D-QSAR model of FQ biodegradability was established through the quantization parameters, and q(+) was identified as the main parameter affecting the biodegradability of FQs through sensitivity analysis. In addition, the docking results of LEV and Derivative-15 with the oxidoreductase in P. chrysosporium showed that the electrostatic field force between Derivative-15 and the amino acid residues promoted the binding of the donor to the receptor protein, thereby increasing the biodegradability of Derivative-15. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the enhancement of the electrostatic field force with Derivative-15 could promote the binding of the ligand to the receptor, which was basically consistent with the conclusion of molecular docking. Finally, the three microbial degradation pathways of LEV and Derivative-15 were also proposed. The total energy barrier value of the pathway with the lowest total energy barrier of biodegradation was reduced by 32.07%, which was basically consistent with the enhancement of biodegradability of Derivative-15.

AB Characterization and source identification of PM2.5 bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are conducted in urban Wuhan (WH), suburban Pingdingshan (PDS), and rural Suizhou (SZ) in China during summer harvest. This study analyzes 16 priority PAHs with 38 PM2.5 samples in June. PAHs had similar physical-chemical properties like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), which had been listed as Priority Pollutants. The concentration and detection frequency of OCPs and PCBs were considerably lower than those of PAHs in PM2.5. Results indicate that PDS adjoining the highway has the highest PM2.5-bound PAHs. SZ possesses the lowest concentration of PAHs. Principal component analysis and multivariate linear regression model and molecular diagnostic ratio distinguish the sources. Vehicle emissions and coal combustion are extracted in three sites, while the source of PDS also includes gas combustion. SZ was affected by gas combustion and petroleum. The potential source contribution function and the concentration-weighted trajectory track the potential pollution area. The sampling places might be affected by the local sources and short distance transmission cannot be neglected. The incremental lifetime cancer risks (ILCRs) model evaluates the exposure risk of PAHs. According to the ILCR model, WH and PDS are exposed to harmful PAHs. By contrast, SZ is a substantially safe place.

AB The recent widespread increase in antibiotic resistance has become a real threat to both human and environmental ecosystem health. In oil reservoirs, an extreme environment potentially influenced by human activity such as water flooding, the distribution and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) remains poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the distribution of ARGs at different positions in a water-flooding oilfield in China, and found that ARGs were observed in all parts of the investigated system. The surface regions of the water re-injection system were more vulnerable to ARG pollution, and the final ARG concentration was up to 2.2 x 10(8) gene copies/L, and sulfonamide were the most abundant. However, ARG concentration decreased sharply in the samples from underground part of the re-injection system. The bacterial community composition was also varied with sampling position. The sample from production well, which was enriched in crude oil, contained more bacteria but the community richness was simpler. This study also indicated the wastewater-recycling process above ground, which proposed to reduce the discharge into environment directly, may pose a risk for ARGs spread.

AB Increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels are commonly considered an indicator of lipid peroxidation derived from oxidative stress insults promoted by exposure of fish to pollutants. However, a decrease in MDA levels after xenobiotic exposure has been also reported, an effect that is mostly attributed to enhanced antioxidant defenses. In this study, we assessed whether pollutant-mediated MDA decrease would be associated with antioxidant enhancement or with its metabolism by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in the liver and gills of lambari (Astyanax altiparanae) exposed to diesel oil (0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mL/L). MDA levels were decreased in the liver of lambari exposed to diesel. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), were unchanged in the liver, while that of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was decreased. In contrast, levels of total glutathione (tGSH) and the activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) were increased in the liver, which partly support antioxidant protection against lipid peroxidation. More importantly, ALDH activity increased in a concentration-dependent manner, being negatively correlated with MDA levels, indicating MDA metabolism by ALDH. In the gills, diesel exposure increased MDA and lipid hydroperoxide levels, and promoted increases in antioxidant defenses, indicating oxidative stress. Curiously, ALDH activity was undetectable in the gills, supporting the possibility of direct MDA excretion in the water by the gills. Analyses of MDA in the water revealed increased levels of MDA in the aquaria in which the fish were exposed to diesel, compared to control aquaria. A second experiment was carried out in which the fish were intraperitoneally injected with MDA (10 mg/kg) and analyzed after 1, 6, and 12 h. MDA injection caused a time-dependent decrease in hepatic MDA levels, did not alter ALDH, CAT, GPx, and GST activities, and decreased G6PDH activity and tGSH levels. In the gills, MDA injection caused a slight increase in MDA levels after 1 h, but did not alter GPx, G6PDH, and GST activities. MDA injection also enhanced CAT activity and tGSH levels in the gills. MDA concentration in water increased progressively after 1, 6, and 12 h, supporting the hypothesis of direct MDA excretion as an alternative route for MDA elimination in fish. Our results suggest that the decreased MDA levels after exposure of lambari to diesel oil pollutant probably reflects an association between enhanced antioxidant protection, MDA metabolism, and MDA excretion in water.

AB Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soils and soil seepage waters were analyzed along with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to investigate the ecological risks and factors controlling the subsurface transport of PAHs in karst terrain in southwest China. The concentrations of dissolved PAHs in soil seepage water increased with depth and the mean concentrations at a depth of 80 cm were relatively high (exceeding 1147 ng/L). PAH composition in soil seepage water was dominated by low molecular weight (LMW) PAHs, whereas those associated with soil matrix were dominated by high molecular weight (HMW) PAHs. The results revealed that HMW PAHs in soil seepage water were closer to the equilibrium of dissolution than LMW and medium molecular weight (MMW) PAHs. However, due to the carrier functions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) for HMW PAHs, all PAHs can be continuously dissolved in the soil seepage water from soil matrix as the water moved vertical downward through the profiles. During this process, dynamic sorption and desorption processes were occurring between constituents in the soil seepage water and the soil matrix. This study demonstrates soil seepage water has posed a high risk to the groundwater, and effective protection is urgently needed.

AB CdS-SBA-15 nanomaterials were synthesized by solvothermal method using cadmium nitrate as cadmium source and thiourea as sulfur source. The properties of as-prepared materials were characterized by means of XRD, FTIR, TEM, XPS, N-2 physisorption, UV-Vis DRS and PL spectra, etc. The results show as-synthesized materials have partially ordered mesoporous structure, larger specific surface area, and higher content of CdS and good crystallinity. The combination of SBA-15 and CdS did almost no reduction in the absorption light range of CdS, but greatly increased the photocapacity of the composite. The synergistic effect of CdS and SBA-15 leads to improving the photocatalytic degradation activity of salicylic acid under visible light. When the photocatalyst was 30 mg (0.75 g/L) and the concentration of salicylic acid was 10 mg/L, the maximum degradation efficiency of salicylic acid was 84.93% after 6 h of light. Photocatalytic reaction has a lower activation energy (2.90 kJ/mol), activation enthalpy (3.13 kJ/mol) and activation entropy (-281.00 J/(mol K)). The photocatalytic mechanism study demonstrates that superoxide radicals (O-2(center dot-)) are the most key active species, e(-) and h(+) have something to do with the photocatalytic reaction, while center dot OH has little to do with the photocatalytic reaction. In sum, the protection effect of SBA-15 on CdS nanomaterials makes the composite have a higher photolumination intensity and a higher photocatalytic activity.

AB As a toxic and carcinogenic metalloid, arsenic has posed serious threat to human health. Phytoremediation has emerged as a promising approach to circumvent this problem. Arsenic uptake by Pteris vittata is largely determined by arsenic speciation and mainly occurs via roots; thus, rhizospheric microbial activities may play a key role in arsenic accumulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of arsenic resistant rhizobacteria to enhance arsenic phytoextraction. A total of 49 cultivable rhizobacteria were isolated from the arsenic hyperaccumulating fern, Pteris vittata, and subjected to an initial analysis to identify potentially useful traits for arsenic phytoextraction, such as arsenic resistance and the presence of aioA(aroA)-like (arsenite oxidase-like) gene. Isolated strain r507, named as Cupriavidus basilensis strain r507, was a selected candidate for its outstanding arsenic tolerance, rapid arsenite oxidation ability, and strong colonization to P. vittata. Strain r507 was used in co-cultivation trials with P. vittata in the field for six months. Results showed that the inoculation with strain r507 potentiated As accumulation of P. vittata up to 171%. Molecular analysis confirmed that the inoculation increased the abundance of aioA-like genes in the rhizosphere, which might have facilitated arsenite oxidation and absorption. The findings of this study suggested the feasibility of co-cultivating hyperaccumulators with facilitator bacteria for practical arsenic phytoremediation.

AB For the first time, we report a correspondence between microplastics (MP) ingestion and ecotoxicological effects in gelatinous zooplankton (Cnidarian jellyfish). The ephyra stage of the jellyfish Aurelia sp. was exposed to both environmental and high concentrations of fluorescent 1-4 mu m polyethylene MP (0.01-10 mg/L). After 24 and 48 h, MP accumulation, acute (Immobility) and behavioral (Frequency pulsation) endpoints were investigated. MP were detected by confocal and tomographic investigations on gelatinous body and mouth, either attached on the surface or ingested. This interaction was responsible for impairing ephyrae survival and behavior at all tested concentrations after 24 h. Acute and behavioral effects were also related to mechanical disturbance, caused by MP, triggering a loss of radial symmetry. Contaminated ephyrae exposed to clean seawater showed full recovery after 72 h highlighting the organisms without the microspheres, attached on body jellyfish surface around the mouth and lappets. In conclusion, short-term exposure to MP affects ephyrae jellyfish health, impairing both their survival and behavior. Polyethylene MP temporarily affect both Immobility and Frequency of pulsation of Aurelia sp. jellyfish. This study provides a first step towards understanding and clarifying the potential impacts of MP contamination in gelatinous zooplankton.

AB Tribolium casteneum is a major stored grains pest causing huge loss by secreting toxic quinones' which make the grains unfit for human consumption. Increasing concern about the fast-growing resistance in T. casteneum against fumigants has evoked more intense research worldwide. Therefore, finding an eco-friendly alternative for the management of the pest is of great importance. In this study, the insecticidal activity of the essential oils (EOs) of Artemisia annua is evaluated. Chemical composition of the EOs eluted with methanol and petroleum ether was analysed through Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The result has reported a total of 13 & 16 compounds in the methanol and petroleum ether EOs respectively. In contact toxicity studies, adults were found more susceptible to the petroleum ether EOs (LD50 = 0.43 mg adult(-1)) than the methanolic EOs (LD50 = 1.87 mg adult(-1)). Petroleum ether EOs was also superior in fumigant assays against both the adults (0.81 mg L air(-1)) and larvae (0.65 mg L air(-1)). Moreover, the same was also recorded as a strong repellent. The bio-molecular studies conducted to gain an insight into the extent of metabolic disturbances inflicted in the treatment sets has shown a significant increase in Lipid peroxidase and decrease (p(<)0.01) in protein, Acetylcholinesterase, Glutathione S Transferees, Reduced Glutathione level. This indicates the major signs of oxidative stress in the treatment sets. The Results ascertain the knowledge to develop natural insecticides from Artemisia annua using a potential solvent to be used in the future as an efficient management tool against T. casteneum.

AB Arsenic is a hazardous environmental pollutant widely distributed globally. Arsenic toxicity is well known and it is regulated by many countries in terms of managing water quality and protecting aquatic organisms. Unfortunately, water quality criterion (WQC) to protect aquatic organisms has not been introduced in Korea yet. Thus, it is of great importance and necessity to introduce WQC to protect aquatic organisms from arsenic, as WQC play a significant role in protecting aquatic ecosystems from pollutants. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to derive arsenic water quality criterion for aquatic life in Korea. Arsenic acute toxicity tests were performed with 10 Korean native aquatic species, which belong to 7 different taxonomic groups. Based on the results of acute toxicity test and additional toxicity data from literature, the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) method was used in ecological risk assessment. The arsenic concentration of 95% protection level for aquatic life was 0.229 mg L-1 in this study. An assessment factor 3 and a background concentration 0.0004 mg L-1 were applied to the concentration value in consideration of the uncertainty of the data and the amount of arsenic natural generation. Consequently, the WQC value derived for arsenic was found to be 0.077 mg L-1. These results will serve as reference values to establish water quality criterion for the protection of aquatic life in Korea.

AB Modulation of plant salt tolerance has been drawing great attention. Thymol is a kind of natural chemical that has been developed as anti-microbial reagent and medicine. To date, we still have limited knowledge about thymol-modulated plant physiology. In this work, physiological, histochemical, and biochemical methods were adopted to study thymol-conferred salt resistance in the root of rice (Oryza sativa). Thymol significantly rescued root growth under salt stress. Thymol ameliorated cell membrane damage, oxidative stress, ROS accumulation, and cell death in roots under salt stress. Thymol-attenuated oxidative stress may be resulted from the activation of anti-oxidative capacity, including both enzymatic and non-enzymatic system. Thymol treatment significantly decreased Na+ content in root cells upon salt stress, which might be ascribed to the upregulation of OsSOS1 (salt overly sensitive 1) facilitating Na+ exclusion. In addition, thymol stimulated the expression of genes encoding tonoplast OsNHX (Na+/H+ antiporter), which may help root cells to compartmentalize Na+ in vacuole. The results of these works evidenced that thymol was capable of inducing salt tolerance by reestablishing ROS homeostasis and modulating cellular Na+ flux in rice roots. These findings may be applicable to improve crop growth in salinity area.

AB Increasing quantities of pharmaceutical waste in the environment have disrupted the balance of ecosystems, and may have subsequent effects on human health. Although a handful of previous studies have shown the impacts of pharmaceutically active compounds on the environment, the toxicological effects of their degradation products remain largely unknown. In the current study, the photo-degradation products of environmental ibuprofen were assessed for both ecotoxicological and human health effects using a series of in vitro assays. Here, six of the major degradation products are synthesized with high purity (>98%) and characterized with (HNMR)-H-1, (CNMR)-C-13, FT-IR and HRMS. To evaluate human health effects, three gut microbiota species, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, and two human cell lines, HEK293T and HepG2, are exposed to various concentrations of ibuprofen and its degradation products. On L. acidophilus, the ibuprofen degradation product (+/-)-(2R,3R)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-5-methylhexan-3-ol shows a greater toxic effect while ibuprofen enhances its growth at lower concentrations. At higher concentrations, ibuprofen shows at least a 2-fold higher toxicity compared to that of its degradation products. However, E. faecalis shows little or no effect upon exposure to these compounds. An induction of the SOS response in E. coli is observed but limited to only ibuprofen and 4-acetylbenzoic acid. In human cell line studies, survival of both HEK293T and HepG2 cell lines is profoundly impaired by the photo-degradation products of (+/-)- (2R,3R)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-5-methylhexan-3-ol, (+/-)-(2R,3S)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-5-methylhexan-3-ol, and (+/-)-1-(4-(1-hydroxy-2methylpropyl)phenyl)ethan-1-one. In this work, the bioluminescence bacterium, Aliivibrio fischeri, is used as a model to assess environmental impact. Both ibuprofen and its degradation products inhibit the growth of this gram-negative bacteria with the primary compound showing the most significant impact. Overall, our results highlight that some of the degradation products of ibuprofen can be more toxic to human kidney cell line and liver cell line than the parent compound while ibuprofen can be more toxic to human gut microbiota and A. fischeri than ibuprofen degradation products.

AB Previous works showed that chronic exposure to Aroclor 1254 disrupted glucose homeostasis and induced insulin resistance in male mice. To further observe the different effects of Aroclor 1254 exposure on the pancreatic alpha-cells and beta-cells, male mice were exposed to Aroclor 1254 (0, 0.5, 5, 50, 500 mu g/kg) for 60 days, the pancreas was performed a histological examination. The results showed that the percentage of apoptosis cell (indicated by TUNEL assay) was increased in both alpha-cells and beta-cells, as the Aroclor 1254 dose was increased; the proliferation (indicated by PCNA expression) rate of beta-cells was elevated while that of alpha-cells was not affected, resulting in an increased beta-cell mass and a decreased alpha-cell mass in a dose-depend manner. The number of Pdx-1 positive beta-cells was significantly increased whereas that of Arx positive alpha-cells was markedly decreased, indicating an enhanced beta-cell neogenesis and a weakened alpha-cell neogenesis. The drastically reduction of serum testosterone levels in all the treatments suggested an anti-androgenic potency of Aroclor 1254. The up-regulation of estrogen receptors (ER alpha and ER beta) and androgen receptor in beta-cells might be responsible for the increased beta-cell mass and neogenesis.

While flourishing growth of Impatiens balsamina L. and Crotalaria retusa L. has been observed in areas adjacent to automobile service stations in Sri Lanka, no systematic study of their tolerance to used lubricating oil (ULO) contaminated soil has been carried out. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the comparative responses of I. balsamina L. and C. retusa L. to soil contaminated with ULO. Both species exhibited 100% seed germination in soils treated with 1%-5% w/w ULO. After 120 h exposure, root lengths and biomass of germinated seedlings of both species were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in all treatments above 3% w/w ULO. The measured growth parameters of plants following 90 d exposure to 0.5-3% w/w ULO, indicated significant (p < 0.05) negative effects on I. balsamina and C. retusa at > 1% w/w and > 2% w/w ULO, respectively. There were no significant effects on chlorophyll content or root anatomy of either species under any treatments. Therefore, we concluded that I. balsamina can tolerate up to 1% of ULO and C. retusa up to 2% w/w ULO without displaying any negative effects. Comparatively higher biodegradation of ULO in the rhizosphere, root nodule formation, increases in root length and root hair density are all possible strategies for the exhibited higher tolerance of C. retusa. Therefore, the overall results indicate that C. retusa has the greater potential to be used in phytoremediation of ULO contaminated soils. The findings of the present study will be beneficial in planning phytoremediation program for ULO contaminated soil.

AB Biochar is a stable carbonaceous by-product of pyrolysis and can be used for toxic metals (TMs) retention in polluted soil. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) was grown in three polluted soils collected from Chenzhou (CZ), Tongguan (TG) and Fengxian (FX), China. Wood biochar (WBC) was applied at 0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0% to each pot filled with 2 kg polluted soil. The results showed that WBC was efficient to alter soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC). The changes in soil pH and EC had a direct relationship with the immobilization and phytostabilization of TMs in the three soils. The bioavailable TMs (Zn, Pb, Cd, and Cu) were reduced in the soil after WBC amendments due to ion exchange, precipitates of metal-carbonates and metal-phosphates, and chemisorption on WBC surface. The reduction in the bioavailable TMs content also resulted in the diminution in TMs shoot uptake in wheat. Similarly, the TMs uptake in wheat root were also reduced as a result of WBC application. The reduction in bioavailable TMs and the release of essential nutrients and base cations from the WBC also increased the wheat shoot and root dry biomasses production. The application of WBC in polluted soil also improved soil health and the urease and beta-glucosidase enzymes were also enhanced. The results concluded that WBC was efficient to reduce the bioavailability of TMs and shoot and root uptake, improved wheat dry biomasses production and soil enzymatic activities in industrial and smelter/mines polluted soils.

AB Eutrophication is an ecological process that results in cyanobacterial blooms. Microcystin-LR is the most toxic variant of microcystins and may cause toxic effects in the organisms, mainly in hepatic tissues. The aims of this study were to use multiple biomarkers in order to evaluate the sublethal effects of a low concentration of MC-LR (1 mu g/L) in fish Geophagus brasiliensis by waterborne exposure; and evaluate the depuration of this toxin during 15 days. A group of 30 fish was exposed to 1 mu g/L of MC-LR solution for 96 h in a static bioassay. After this time, blood, brain, muscle, liver, gonad and gills were collected from half of the exposed fish group in order to evaluate chemical, biochemical, histological and genotoxic biomarkers. The rest of the fish group was submitted to the depuration experiment with free MC-LR water for 15 days. After this time the same tissues were collected and evaluated using biomarkers analysis. Toxic effects were found mostly in the fish liver from depuration time as alterations on the antioxidant system and histopathologies. The results showed that even low concentrations can cause sublethal effects to aquatic organisms, and cyanotoxins monitoring and regulation tools are required.

AB We employed nematode Caenorhabditis elegant to determine the combinational effect between nanopolystyrene at predicted environmental concentration and microcystin-LR (MC-LR). Prolonged exposure to nanopolystyrene (1 mu g/L) increased MC-LR (0.1 mu g/L) toxicity in reducing brood size and locomotion behavior and in inducing oxidative stress. Moreover, the adsorption of MC-LR by nanopolystyrene particles played an important role in inducing the enhancement in MC-LR toxicity by nanopolystyrene particles. Additionally, only exposure to re-uspension of nanopolystyrene (1 mu g/L) caused the increased intestinal permeability in MC-LR (0.1 mu g/L) exposed nematodes. Our data indicates the potential of nanopolystyrene at predicted environmental concentration in enhancing MC-LR toxicity on environmental organisms.

AB Aerosols from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered to be potentially hazardous to on-site employees and surrounding residents. However, their harmful components and their effects remain poorly understood. In this study, the characteristics, responsible factors, sources and exposure risks of potential pathogens and toxic metal(loid)s in aerosols from four WWTPs were investigated. There were 21 potential pathogens and 15 toxic metal(loid)s detected in the aerosols. Arcobacter and Fe were the dominant taxa responsible for the dissimilarity of the potential pathogen population and toxic metal(loid) composition between the aerosols and the wastewater/sludge, respectively. Both meteorological factors and sources affected pathogen and toxic metal(loid) composition. The potential pathogens and toxic metal(loid)s in indoor aerosols mainly originated from wastewater/sludge, while those in outdoor aerosols originated from wastewater/sludge and ambient air. The highest respirable fraction (< 3.30 mu m) concentrations and proportions were detected at the aeration units. Non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of toxic metal(loid)s for both adults and children were found within and/or around WWTPs, and non-carcinogenic risks of bacteria for children were found at downwind, suggesting the need for active safeguard procedures, such as that employees wear masks and work clothes, covering the main emission sites, and collecting and destroying of aerosols.

AB Breeding the rice cultivar with high cadmium (Cd) accumulation in straw but with low Cd in brown rice using marker-assisted selection (MAS) based on quantitative trait loci (QTL) is meaningful for phytoremediation as well as safety in production. A restorer rice line, YaHui2816, steadily showed low Cd translocation from straw to brown rice and carried alleles for reducing Cd concentration in brown rice (BRCdC). In this study, one F-2 population (C268A/YaHui2816) was used to identify the QTLs for BRCdC in 2016, and other two different F-2 populations (Lu98A/YaHui2816 and 5406A/YaHui2816) were used to furtherly validate the QTLs in 2017. Furthermore, a pot experiment was conducted to investigate the relative expression of predicted genes in the regions of these QTLs for BRCdC. Here 4 QTLs for BRCdC were identified, among which, 2 novel QTLs (qBRCdC-9 and qBRCdC-12) were identified on chromosomes 9 and 12 in rice. The YaHui2816 alleles in the QTLs qBECdC-9 and qBRCdC-12 could effectively reduce BRCdC under different genetic backgrounds. Importantly, the QTL qBECdC-12 was simultaneously associated with the Cd translocation from shoot to brown rice (T-s-b), genetically explaining that the low T-s-b of the YaHui2816 resulted in its low BRCdC. The interval length of the QTL qBRCdC-12 was only narrowed to 0.28 cM, making it possible to develop molecular markers and excavate genes for reducing BRCdC. It is worth noting that genes existed in these QTL regions have not been reported for regulating the Cd translocation in rice. 6 candidate genes (OS05G0198400, OS05G0178300, OS09G0544400, O512G0161100, OS12G0162100 and OS12G0165200) up-regulated expressed in nodeIIof the YaHui2816 in response to Cd treatment, and encoded ZRT/IRT-like protein (ZIP) 4, the protein similar to glutathione transferase (GSTs) 16, heat shock protein Hsp20 domain containing protein, MAP kinase-like protein and Cd tolerant protein 5, respectively.

AB Phytoremediation is an alternative for remediating soil contamination by copper, and its efficiency has been shown to increase when arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and earthworms are separately inoculated into the soil. This study evaluated the isolated and combined effects of inoculating earthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi into a sandy soil on copper phytoremediation by Canavalia ensiformis. The plants were grown in a greenhouse in soil contaminated with 100 mg Cu kg(-1) with and without being inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizoglomus clarum and the earthworm Eisenia andrei. The availabilities of solid-phase Cu and other nutrients in the soil solution and plant growth were evaluated along with Cu phytotoxicity based on photochemical efficiency and oxidative stress enzyme activity. Accumulation of Cu and other nutrients in the shoots and roots; mycorrhizal colonization, nodulation, and reproduction; and Cu accumulation in the earthworm tissues were also evaluated. The copper caused photosynthetic and biochemical damage that reduced the shoot dry weight by 44% and the root dry weight by 29%. However, the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus alleviated the Cu toxicity to the plant and increased the shoot dry weight by 81% in the contaminated soil. The earthworms increased the Cu uptake and translocation to the shoot by 31%. The combined presence of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus and earthworms in the contaminated soil increased the growth and Cu content of the aerial plant tissues, yielding a 200% increase in Cu accumulation (metal content x biomass) in the C. ensiformis shoots. Combined inoculation with earthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increased copper phytoextraction by Canavalia ensiformis in a sandy soil.

AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a class of emerging persistent organic pollutants (POPs). They are widely used in industrial and consumer applications. Due to their persistence, bioaccumulation, long-distance migration and toxicity, it is important to find new compounds that can replace PFASs. The present review investigated the sources, fates and environmental effects of alternative PFAS compounds using surveys have been conducted over the past several years. Concentrations of PFAS alternatives in various environmental media, as well as human tissues, are summarized based on the available data. The results showed that hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer (HFPO-DA), hexafluoropropylene trimer acids (HFPO-TA), and 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid (6:2 Cl-PFESA) have become the dominant global perfluorinated pollutants. Currently, there are a few toxicity assessments of these novel fluorinated alternatives, showing that they have systemic multiple organ toxicities. PFAS alternatives exhibited comparable or even more serious potential toxicity than legacy PFASs, indicating that these fluorinated alternatives are also harmful to the environment. Therefore, these alternatives require additional toxicological studies to confirm whether they can be used for a long time.

AB In low concentration, fluoride is considered a necessary compound for human health. Exposure to high concentrations of fluoride is the reason for a serious disease called fluorosis. Fluorosis is categorized as Skeletal and Dental fluorosis. Several Asian countries, such as India, face contamination of water resources with fluoride. In this study, a comprehensive overview on fluoride contamination in Asian water resources has been presented. Since water contamination with fluoride in India is higher than other Asian countries, a separate section was dedicated to review published articles on fluoride contamination in this country. The status of health effects in Asian countries was another topic that was reviewed in this study. The effects of fluoride on human organs/ systems such as urinary, renal, endocrine, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, brain, and reproductive systems were another topic that was reviewed in this study. Different methods to remove fluoride from water such as reverse osmosis, electrocoagulation, nanofiltration, adsorption, ion-exchange and precipitation/coagulation were introduced in this study. Although several studies have been carried out on contamination of water resources with fluoride, the situation of water contamination with fluoride and newly developed technology to remove fluoride from water in Asian countries has not been reviewed. Therefore, this review is focused on these issues: 1) The status of fluoride contamination in Asian countries, 2) health effects of fluoride contamination in drinking water in Asia, and 3) the existing current technologies for defluoridation in Asia.

AB Obtaining accurate measurements of the partition coefficients between sorbent materials and water is of major importance for the analysis of the adsorption behavior and dissolved concentrations of organic compounds in the environment. In the passive-sampling approach, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has a wide range of applications. Therefore, we established a poly-parameter linear-free energy relationship (pp-LFER) and a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to predict the log KPDMS-w values for a large dataset of 290 organic chemicals from 11 diverse classes. For the pp-LFER model, E (excess molar refractivity), A (molecular H-bond donor ability), V (McGowan volume), and B (the H-bond acceptor properties) were introduced as the main correlated variables. However, the obtained model is much limited in terms of acquiring available descriptors. For this reason, we developed a QSAR model, and CrippenLogP (Crippen octanol-water partition coefficient), RNCG (Relative negative charge-most negative charge/total negative charge), ATSC4e (Centered Broto-Moreau autocorrelation-lag4/weighted by Sanderson electronegativities) and GATS6p (Geary autocorrelation-lag6/weighted by polarizabilities) were selected as the significant parameters. The predictive power and functional reliability of the presented models were confirmed with validation methods as described in previous studies. The adjusted determination coefficients (R-adj(2)) of 0.851 and 0.922 and leave-one-out cross-validated (Q(LOO)(2)) of 0.841 and 0.907 revealed that the models have good predictive power and generalizability. Thus, the proposed models are simple yet accurate tools for predicting the log KPDMS-w values and providing new insights to further understand the adsorption mechanism of organic compounds.

AB Heavy metal pollution is one of the most widespread and complex environmental issues globally, posing a great threat to the ecosystem as well as human health. Bioremediation through heavy metal-resistant bacteria (HMRB) is currently the most promising technology to address this issue. To obtain HMRB to remediate heavy metal pollution potentially, 15 culturable HMRB strains were isolated from the sludge samples of an electroplating wastewater treatment plant (EWWTP), which belonged to the Bacillus, Shewanella, Lysinibacillus, and Acinetobacter genera. Their maximum tolerance concentrations to Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Cr2O72- were 40 mM, 10 mM, 200 mM, 40 mM, and 10 mM, respectively, and strain Mn1-4 showed much higher Mn2+ tolerance and removal effectiveness (3.355 g/L) than previously published reports. Moreover, multiple heavy metal-resistant genotypes and phenotypes were identified among these strains, of which strain Co1-1 carried the most of resistant gene sequences (10) and exhibited resistance to 7 categories of heavy metals, and the co-occurrence of heavy metal and antibiotic resistance were clearly observed in strain Ni1-3. In addition, flanked insert sequence (IS) elements on the heavy metal resistant genes (HMRGs) suggested that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events may have resulted in multiple heavy metal resistance phenotypes and genotypes in these strains, and IS982 family transposase was presumed to result in the high Ni2+ tolerance in strain Ni1-3. This study expands our understanding of bacterial heavy metal resistance and provides promising candidates for heavy metal bioremediation.

AB Phytoremediation is an ecologically sustainable method for remediating contaminated soils, however, research on phytoremediation and its mechanisms are still rarely reported. The highest dibutyl phthalate (DBP) dissipation rate was 91% in 0-3mm bok choy rhizosphere via a 45-day rhizo-box experiment, and bok choy could regulate soil nutrients by increasing soil ammonia nitrogen (AN) and available phosphorus (AP). The biochemistry mechanism of interaction between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and DBP was also elucidated by various spectroscopy techniques. It was found that the alkyl ester in DBP produced the fastest response during the binding process, and the aromatic, hydroxyl and phenolic groups of the DOM humic-like substances preceded amide in DOM protein-like substance. It was found that DBP pollution reduced the Chaol richness and Shannon index of bacteria in black soil via a pot experiment and high-throughput sequencing, which disturbed the metabolic activities and functional diversity of microorganisms in Mollisol. The microbial abundance increased in bok choy amendments, which has a specific microbial community structure and a high abundance of Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria. We concluded that some enriched genera were responsible for DBP dissipation, Alsobacter, Lacibacter, Myceligenerans, Schrenkiella parvula and Undibacterium. The findings of this study revealed that the possible biochemistry and microbial mechanisms of phytoremediation promoting the DBP dissipation in rhizosphere Mollisol and provided more useful information for phytoremediation of organic pollutants.

AB The coexistence of parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PPAHs) and halogenated PAHs (HPAHs) in drinking water has generated much concern recently. However, a method to simultaneously determine these compounds has not been developed. In this study, a method using solid-phase extraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for determination of PPAHs and HPAHs in drinking water was established. Forty-two target compounds including 16 PPAHs and 26 HPAHs (16 chlorinated PAHs (CI-HPAHs) and 10 brominated PAHs (Br-PAHs)) were selected to evaluate the performance. Our results indicate enriching compounds with a LC18 cartridge and eluting with dichloromethane is optimal with recovery of 74.88-119.4%. Method detection limits ranged from 0.34 to 3.37 ng L-1 when only using 1 L samples. The method accomplished the analysis of trace PPAHs and HPAHs. We found the coexistence of PPAHs and HPAHs including 12 PPAHs, 2 CI-PAHs and 3 Br-PAHs in tap water samples. Maximum total concentration of PPAHs and HPAHs reached 33.69 ng L-1 and 3.04 ng L-1, respectively. Trace Br-PAHs were first detected in drinking water. 6-bromobenzene[a]pyrene was dominated among the HPAHs with a concentration from 2.30 to 2.69 ng L-1. The simultaneous occurrence of PPAHs and HPAHs in drinking water should receive more attention, and their formation mechanism should be further explored.

AB Oil spills have polluted the marine environment for decades and continue to be a major source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to marine ecosystems around the globe, for example during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill. Although the toxicity of PAHs to fish has been well studied, their effects combined with abiotic stressors are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to describe the combined impacts of crude oil and environmental stressors on fish larvae, a sensitive life stage. Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) larvae (< 24 h post-hatch) were exposed for 48 h to high energy water accommodated fractions (HEWAF; total PAHs 0-125 ppb) of Macondo oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill under different combinations of environmental conditions (dissolved oxygen 2, 6 ppm; temperature 20, 25, 30 degrees C; salinity 3, 10, 30 ppt). Even under optimal environmental conditions (25 degrees C, 10 ppt, 6 ppm) larval survival and development were negatively affected by PAHs, starting with the lowest concentration tested (similar to 15 ppb). Hypoxia and high temperature each increased the adverse effects of HEWAF on development and mortality. In contrast, salinity had little effect on any of the endpoints measured. Importantly, expression of the detoxifying gene cyp1a was highly induced in PAH-exposed larvae under normoxic conditions, but not under hypoxic conditions, potentially explaining the enhanced toxicity observed under hypoxia. This work highlights the importance of considering how suboptimal environmental conditions can exacerbate the effects of pollution on fish early life stages.

AB The bioavailability of heavy metals in restored mangrove wetland sediments at the Jinjiang Estuary was assessed through acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) and simultaneously extracted metals (SEM). The results indicated that the SEM distributions were more even than the AVS in the restored regions, and the AVS acted as an important carrier for SEM. SEM-(Zn) was a major part (61.4-70.6%) of Sigma SEM, whereas the most toxic metal, Cd, accounted for approximately 0.2%. The possible adverse effects increased in the surface and subsurface sediments (0-20 cm), with no potential bioavailability in deeper layers. This was probably due to the higher AVSs binding to heavy metal ions in the restored regions compared to the mudflat (control group). The conclusions were also similar when taking TOC concentrations into account. Mangrove wetland restoration has significant effects on the bioavailability of heavy metals in sediments. According to the thresholds for metal toxicity on benthic organisms in sediments, Pb, Cu and Ni had potential adverse effects on benthic organisms in this restored wetland.

AB Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a multifunctional gasotransmitter, participates in a wide range of cellular signal transduction and pathophysiological processes. Cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) acts as a major H2S-generating enzyme in peripheral organs and tissues. As a cysteine-rich and heavy metal-binding protein, metallothionein-1 (MT-1) is known to protect cells from various environmental stresses. Here we demonstrated that exposure of cadmium (Cd) induced oxidative stress, depleted intracellular thiols, and stimulated apoptotic cell death in mouse myoblast cells. CSE expression and H2S production were significantly enhanced by Cd treatment. NaHS, a well-known H2S donor, at physiologically relevant concentration significantly alleviated Cd-induced damage in both myoblasts and mouse skeletal muscles. In contrast, down-regulation of CSE/H2S system deteriorated Cd-stimulated oxidative stress and cell death. Exposure of the cells to Cd lead to increased expressions of metal regulatory transcription factor 1 and MT-1, while siRNA-mediated MT-1 knockdown alleviated Cd-induced CSE expression and caused more oxidative stress and cell death. In addition, H2S post-translationally modified MT-1 by S-sulfhydration and stabilized zinc-protein complex. Taken together, these data suggest that CSE/H2S system would protect myoblasts and skeletal muscles from Cd-induced damage by S-sufhydrating MT-1.

AB Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins are key shellfish toxins that cause diarrhea, vomiting and even tumor. Interestingly, bivalves such as Perna viridis have been reported to exhibit some resistances to alleviate toxic effects of DSP toxins in a species-specific manner. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance phenomenon to DSP toxins, particularly the mechanistic role of CYP450 is scant despite its crucial role in detoxification. Here, we exposed P. viridis to Prorocentrum lima and examined the expression pattern of the CYP450 and our comprehensive analyses revealed that P. lima exposure resulted in unique expression pattern of key CYP450 genes in bivalves. Exposure to P. lima (2 x 10(5) cells/L) dramatically orchestrated the relative expression of CYP450 genes. CYP2D14-like mRNA was significantly down-regulated at 6 h in gill, but up-regulated at 2 h in digestive gland compared with control counterparts (p < 0.05), while CYP3A4 mRNA was increased at 12 h in gill. After exposure to P. lima at 2 x 10(6) cells/L, the expression of CYP3A4 mRNA was significantly increased in digestive gland at 2 h and 12 h, while CYP2D14-like was up-regulated at 6 h. Besides, CYP3L3 and CYP2C8 also exhibited differential expression. These data suggested that CYP3A4, CYP2D14-like, and even CYP3L3 and CYP2C8 might be involved in DSP toxins metabolism. Besides, provision of ketoconazole resulted in significant decrement of CYP3A4 in digestive gland at 2 h and 12 h, while the OA content significantly decreased at 2 h and 6 h compared to control group without ketoconazole. These findings indicated that ketoconazole could depress CYP3A4 activity in bivalves thereby altering the metabolic activities of DSP toxins in bivalves, and also provided novel insights into the mechanistic role of CYP3A4 on DSP toxins metabolism in bivalves.

AB 2,2',4,4'-tetrabrominated diphenyl ether (BDE-47) and 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99) are two typical polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and studies have proven that these PBDs can disrupt the behaviors and physical function of aquatic organisms. However, little is known about the compositional impacts of BDE-47/BDE-99 compound pollution on the feeding behavior of Daphnia magna. In this study, a response surface methodology (RSM) was introduced into the combined toxicity assessment of BDE-47 and BDE-99 on the feeding depression of D. magna. Low concentrations of BDE-47 (9.2 mu g/L) and BDE-99 (5.4 mu g/L) had no effect on the feeding behavior of D. magna; nevertheless, the feeding depression was strengthened, and a concentration-dependent effect was observed with increasing concentrations of BDE-47 and BDE-99. The results of RSM indicated that the mixture of BDE-47 and BDE-99 can enhance their toxicity on the feeding behavior of D. magna. Moreover, real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that the down-regulation of a-amylase CAMS) appeared in most of the exposed D. magna. However, there were significant different in the gene expression of trypsin, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) between the exposure and control groups. The change in the enzyme activity of AMS, trypsin, SOD and CAT implied that BDE-47 and BDE-99 cause damage to the digestive and antioxidative systems of D. magna. Correlation analysis indicated that a significant positive correlation existed between the gene expression and enzyme activity of SOD and CAT. Our results contribute to the understanding of toxicity caused by BDE-47/BDE-99 compound pollution in D. magna and help to improve traditional toxicity assessment methods for aquatic environments.

AB The pollution by industrial and municipal effluents are major sources of concerns. Fish cell cultures were applied in different strategies of the evaluation of effluents, particularly whole toxicity, toxicity identification evaluation and mode of action studies based in adverse outcome pathways. Whole effluent toxicity was evaluated using a battery of five model systems from four trophic levels: Daphnia magna was the most sensitive system, followed by the hepatoma fish cell line PLHC-1, the bacterium Allivibrio fischeri, the fibroblastic fish cell line RTG-2 and the algae Chlorella vulgaris, detecting a risk of eutrofization. The uptake of neutral red was more sensitive than the content of protein assay. The main morphological alterations observed were cell loss, hydropic degeneration, and a general loss of lysosomes and of their perinuclear distribution. The toxicity was characterized in PLHC-1 cells through toxicity identification evaluation, in which a partial reduction with graduation at pH 11, filtration, aeration and addition of thiosulfate or EDTA was shown; on the other hand, a low sorption in solid phase extraction suggested that the main responsible were not organic compounds. Consequently, it was not necessary to apply an effect directed analysis HPLC fractionation. In the chemical identification phase, Zn, Cd, As, Cu and Pb were quantified in decreasing concentrations. In the toxicity confirmation phase, a reconstituted sample and individual solutions, presented decreasing toxicity: Zn > Pb > As+5 > Cd > Cu > As+3, the global toxicity being explained by response addition. In the last step, the mode of action was investigated using five specific biomarkers. While metallothionein and succinate dehydrogenase activity were increased, no changes occurred for lysosomal function, acetylcholinesterase and EROD activities, the responsibility of the toxicity for the elements found being confirmed.

AB In the present study the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon removal and metabolic adaptation of Amycolatopsis tucumanensis DSM 45259 were investigated. Analysis of one-dimensional gel electrophoresis of crude cell extracts revealed differential synthesis of proteins which were identified by MALDI-TOF. To elucidate the phenanthrene metabolic pathway in A. tucumanensis DSM45259, two-dimensional electrophoresis and detection of phenanthrene degradation intermediates by GS-MS were performed. The presence of aromatic substrates resulted in changes in the abundance of proteins involved in the metabolism of aromatic compounds, oxidative stress response, energy production and protein synthesis. The obtained results allowed us to clarify the phenanthrene catabolic pathway, by confirming the roles of several proteins involved in the degradation process and comprehensive adaptation. This may clear the way for more efficient engineering of bacteria in the direction of more effective bioremediation applications.

AB Exposure to endotoxin occurs environmentally and occupationally. There are several differences between them in terms of the variety and severity of health outcomes, possible exposed groups and type and route of exposure. Occupational exposures caused adverse health outcomes in almost all cases, but there is disparity in the incidence of significant health outcomes due to environmental exposure to endotoxin. This study has therefore endeavoured to investigate health outcomes from environmental exposure to endotoxin. A systematic review was conducted of three databases and non-occupational studies reporting the environmental concentration of endotoxin, and observed health outcomes in exposed groups were included in the review (n = 27). The studies showed that first exposure to endotoxin occurs in infancy by the inhalation route. Inhalation is the only exposure route that can induce inflammation as the main symptom of exposure to endotoxin. The studies included were conducted using four approaches: molecular immunology, measurement of lung volumes, clinical sensitisation test and diagnosis of asthmatic and respiratory symptoms such as wheezing. By the immunological approach, all the included studies reported that environmental exposure to endotoxin, especially at a younger age, has a protective effect on the incidence of asthma in adolescence. The main disparity observed was in studies using the approach of diagnosed asthma. Overall, however, they confirm the protective effect of exposure to endotoxin although, in the case of children with non-atopic asthma, the results could be different.

AB The endocrine disrupting properties of bisphenol A (BPA) discharged to the environment have been newly identified by the European Chemicals Agency, increasing the need to assess the environmental endocrine disrupting potentials of its alternatives with which it shares close structural features. However, few investigations of the environmental endocrine disrupting functions of BPA analogs have been conducted to date. In this study, the endocrine disrupting effects of a BPA analog of bisphenol P (BPP) were investigated in the nonbiting midge (Chironomus tentans), a model organism in ecotoxicology. An initial ex vivo test using salivary gland cells ex planted from the larvae and a subsequent in vivo test using embryos and larvae revealed the upregulatory effects of BPP on ecdysone receptor genes encoding the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and the early responsive gene E74, with a similar temporal pattern of gene activation. Partial life cycle and full life cycle toxicity tests demonstrated BPP altered embryo hatching, larval emergence, and adult sex ratio at concentrations close to the effective concentrations for hormonal genetic endpoints in embryos and larvae after 48 h of exposure. Although embryos appeared to be more sensitive to BPP than the fourth instar larvae, the impact on neither life stage seemed enough to estimate the developmental impairment of the insects. These results demonstrate the ecdysone pathway is a target of BPP, and that long-term exposure could cause apical effects on the development of C. tentans. The endocrine disrupting effects towards aquatic organisms, as well as the high persistence and bio-concentration potential, indicate an urgent need to assess the environmental risks associated with BPP.

AB Owing to its persistence, carbamazepine an antiepileptic drug is regularly detected in the aquatic environment. The motive for our research was to assess the bioconcentration, physiological and biochemical effects of carbamazepine in Daphnia magna. A 48 h aqueous exposure of carbamazepine yielded bioconcentration factors of 202.56 and 19.95 in Daphnia magna for the respective nominal treatments of 5 and 100 mu g/L. Apparently, the inhibition of the capability of Daphnia magna to obtain food attributable to carbamazepine exposure will reduce their fitness to reproduce as well as to grow. Also, a significant alteration in the phototactic behaviour of Daphnia magna exposed to carbamazepine is maladaptive since it will increase their chance of being preyed upon in the surface water during daylight. Again, a significant decline in the acetylcholinesterase activity observed herein brings to light the neurotoxicity of carbamazepine to Daphnia magna. Moreover, significant inhibition of the superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione reductase activities coupled with the simultaneous induction of the malondialdehyde content imply that carbamazepine evoked a life-threatening oxidative stress that overpowered the antioxidant defence system of Daphnia magna. These observations confirm that carbamazepine can accumulate and consequently cause negative physiological and biochemical changes to wild Daphnia magna populations.

AB Xanthium strumarium is an annual pseudometallophyte. To reveal the mechanisms of this species to adapt to metallicolous environmental conditions, phenological traits and biomass allocation of metallicolous and non-metallicolous populations of X. strumarium under six Mn2+ concentrations by pot culture experiments were performed. The results showed that both time to bolting and time to fruit setting in the metallicolous population were earlier than those in the non-metallicolous population. The number of flowers, fruits, seeds and 1000-seed weight in the metallicolous population were higher than those in the non-metallicolous population under Mn stress. Reproductive allocation and harvest index in the metallicolous population were higher than those in the non-metallicolous population. Furthermore, all the Mn concentrations in leaves, stems, roots, and fruits of the metallicolous population were higher than the counterparts of non-metallicolous population. These results suggested that metallicolous population had higher tolerance to Mn stress than non-metallicolous population, the earlier flowering and fruiting, and the enhancement in reproductive allocation may contribute to plant tolerance to Mn toxicity for X. strumarium.

AB Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a major occupational and environmental chemical compound which causes occupational dermatitis medicamentosa-like of TCE with severe liver damage. Our previous studies showed that complement activation was a newly recognized mechanism for TCE-induced liver damage. The objective of this study was to explore the role of the key complement regulatory protein, CD59a, in TCE-induced immune liver injury. We firstly evaluated the changes of CD59a expression in liver tissue and then investigated if the changes were associated with membrane attack complex (MAC) formation, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation and liver damage in BALB/c mice model of TCE-induced skin sensitization in the absence or presence of soluble recombinant rat CD59-Cys. The results showed that low expression of CD59a accompanied by MAC deposition in the liver of TCE-sensitized BALB/c mice, which was consistent in time. In addition, activation of NF-kappa B pathway, upregulation of inflammatory cytokine and liver damage also occured. Additional experiment showed that recombinant rat sCD59-Cys alleviated inflammation and liver damage in TCE-sensitized BALB/c mice. Moreover, recombinant rat sCD59-Cys reduced MAC formation and inhibited NF-kappa B activation measured by P-I kappa B alpha and nuclear NF-kappa B p65 in the liver of TCE-sensitized BALE/c mice. In conclusion, recombinant rat sCD59-Cys plays a protective role in immune liver injury of TCE-sensitized BALB/c mice.

AB The present work reports the preparation of CO2-activated carbon (AC) using Stevia rebaudiana (Bertoni) residue as a new carbon precursor. The experimental parameters were optimized via chemometrics tools to obtain an AC with high BET surface area (S-BET). The found optimum condition was: activation temperature of 900 degrees C, CO2 flow of 165 cm(3) g(-1) and activation time of 60 min, providing an AC(op) with S-BET of 874 m(2) g(-1). The AC(op) was characterized from several analytical techniques, which showed that it has heterogeneous morphology features and different surface chemical groups, predominating the acidic character. The adsorption performance of AC(op) for triclosan (TCS) removal from solution was investigated by kinetic, equilibrium and thermodynamic studies. The results showed that TCS adsorption process onto AC(op) is spontaneous and endothermic, wherein the mechanism occurs by different steps, which equally play important roles. Additionally, the monolayer adsorption capacity (Q(m)) was found to be 117.00 mg g(-1).

AB Enhancing industrial sludge detoxification is of scientific and practical significance in confronting urban development and stringent environmental regulations. A strategy combining ultrasound (US) with the zero-valent iron/EDTA/Air (ZEA) process was proven to be eco-friendly, being efficient in the removal of toxic compounds from textile dyeing sludge in our previous studies. In this paper, therefore, the detoxification effects of three advanced oxidation processes (US, ZEA, US/ZEA) on textile dyeing sludge were comparatively evaluated for the first time through alteration of the sludge's physico-chemical parameters (e.g., macronutrients, heavy metals, and persistent organic pollutants) and toxicity (plants and aquatic biota), by which the appropriateness of industrial sludge's agricultural use was assessed. The results showed that US led to the least alteration of the physico-chemical properties, and the treated sludge became less biodegradable, as demonstrated by XPS. With ZEA treatment, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were degraded by oxidation, and heavy metals were more leachable, leading to effective detoxification with a relatively low sludge dose, but an excessive amount of EDTA would negatively change the fertilizing properties of the sludge. However, the integration of US and ZEA could avoid this situation, as US promoted the degradation of EDTA and POPs, thus causing the least inhibition or even a noticeable stimulation of plant growth when the sludge dosage was 7.5 t(dw)/ha (recommended dosage by the latest legislation in China). Aquatic organism toxicity tests further confirmed that US/ZEA treatment realized the most significant toxicity reduction, leading to the slightest environmental disruption. This study could be instructive in providing guidance for industrial sludge management considering agricultural use.

AB The surface catalysis of goethite on the Cr(VI) reduction by tartaric acid was examined together with its adsorption characteristics towards the two reactants. The results showed the adsorption of tartaric acid by goethite was favorable at low pH and adsorption isotherm could be properly described by Langmuir model. The adsorption kinetic curves for both reactants obeyed the pseudo second-order rate model (R-2 > 0.99). The FTIR spectrum suggested the formation of bidentate binuclear surface complexes between tartaric acid and goethite. At pH 4.50, the reduction percentage of 0.1 mM Cr(VI) by 1.0 mM tartaric acid alone was about 12% after 72 h, while which was increased to 100% in the presence of goethite within 24 h. Kinetic results revealed the Cr(VI) reduction only occurred between the adsorbed tartaric acid and the aqueous Cr(VI) since the Cr(VI) adsorption was completely inhibited under the examined conditions. Meanwhile, the catalysis of aqueous Fe(III) released from the goethite surfaces was excluded due to its low concentration (< 5 mu M). With the initial concentration of tartaric acid decreased to 0.1 mM, Cr(VI) reduction could be completed within 4 h, confirmed by the XPS result that only Cr(III) species existed on the goethite surfaces. In this case, electron transfer was suggested to occur directly between the two adsorbed reactants or goethite was believed to serve as an ideal channel to allow electron excited from the adsorbed tartaric acid to transfer to the adsorbed Cr(VI). The findings above were helpful for us to understand the Cr(VI) reduction by organic compounds in soils with rich contents of Fe-oxides.

AB The study was conducted to evaluate the influence of physicochemical properties of soil, moisture and temperature on the dissipation behaviour of bispyribac sodium under laboratory conditions. Bispyribac sodium residues were extracted using matrix solid phase dispersion and were quantified using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. The mean percent recovery of bispyribac sodium from studied soils ranged from 82.7 +/- 8.3-105.1 +/- 2.6%. The limit of quantification and limit of detection was 0.006 and 0.002 mu g g(-1), respectively. Dissipation of bispyribac sodium followed first order kinetics and soil type greatly influenced the dissipation behaviour of bispyribac sodium. Dissipation was faster in loam soil (DT50 = 12.79-14.52days) followed by clay loam (DT50 = 22.01-23.15days), sandy loam (DT50 = 23.34-25.17 days) and loamy sand soil (DT50 = 25.39-27.32days). The amendment of soil with FYM enhanced the dissipation of bispyribac sodium by 1.86-5.96-fold. It dissipated slowly under submerged (DT50 = 21.41-40.96days) conditions as compared to field capacity (DT50 = 12.79-27.32days) in studied soils. The degradation rate increased with the increase in temperature in studied soils and DT so ranged from 12.79 to 40.96, 7.36-36.96 and 4.09-31.61days at 30, 40 and 50 degrees C, respectively.

AB PM2.5 particles were collected to study the distribution, accumulation and health risk assessment of metal pollutants. The concentrations of 11 kinds of metal elements in PM2.5 during heating period and non-heating period were analyzed. Based on the American health risk assessment model as well as the human exposure parameters in China, the human health risk was assessed. The concentrations of metal components in PM2.5 during the heating period were, in descending order, Pb, Mn, Cr, As, Sb, Se, Ni, Cd, Tl, Hg, and Be, while during the non-heating period, they were basically in the same order, except Cd and Ni, as the concentration of the former was a little higher than that of the latter. The concentrations of As, Cd, Hg, Ni, Se, and Tl were quite different in the heating period and non-heating period. The non-carcinogenic risks caused by metal elements were lower than the minimum acceptance 10(-6) per year during both the heating period and non-heating period. The non-carcinogenic results of a descending order were Pb, Mn, Sb, Tl, Se, and Hg. The carcinogenic risks of a descending order were Cr, As, Cd, Ni, and Be. The risks of As and Cr to children were over 10(-6). Hence, As and Cr should be considered as priorities.

AB In recent years, the haze incidents have occurred frequently in China. Therefore, more attention should be taken in comprehensively determination and analysis of the extended-ranges of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here, up to 99 non-methane VOCs (NMVOCs), including not frequently reported partial halocarbons and oxygenated VOC (OVOC) species, were monitored in atmosphere of Beijing. The mean concentration of total NMVOC (TNMVOC) decreased in the order of winter polluted days (216.05 mu g m(-3)) > summer polluted days (127.01 mu g m(-3)) > summer normal days (95.63 mu g m(-3)) > winter normal days (50.25 mu g m(-3)). The ethane to n-butane, ethylene to 1-butene, BTEX, acetaldehyde, acetone, n-hexanal, dichloromethane, chloroform and 1,2-dichloroethane, were determined to be the main composition in their respective alkane, alkene, aromatic, OVOC and halocarbon classes. The minor propylbenzene, diethylbenzene, ethyltoluene, and trimethylbenzene isomer ratios were within the narrow range of 1.3-3.21. Generally, the most abundant NMVOCs were alkanes in winter but OVOCs in summer. TNMVOC significantly positively correlated with PM10, PM2.5, CO, RH, SO2 (winter), NO2 (winter), but negatively with windspeed, SSD and PRS (winter). The opposite correlation was observed between TNMVOC and O-3 in winter and summer. There was no meaningful correlation between TNMVOC and T, PRS (summer), SO2 (summer) and NO2 (summer). 3D surface graphs, built by MATLAB, were drawn to investigate the relationship between PM2.5 and NMVOC taking air quality parameters into account. The PM2.5 concentration increased non-linearly as TNMVOC concentration increased, with various surface graphs. Unlike other air quality parameters, O-3 affected the relationship differently between winter and summer. The findings presented herein may provide a new train of thought for occurrence of haze.

AB Dissolved humic acid (DI-IA) from soil can interact with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and magnetic-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MMWCNTs), and subsequently alter the toxicity of MWCNTs and MMWCNTs to amaranth. This is the first study to compare the effects of MWCNTs and MMWCNTs under natural DHAs on their toxicity to amaranth. When DHAs were combined with 0.5 g/L MWCNTs, 1:2:1 MMWCNTs and 4:2:1 MMWCNTs nanomaterials, DHA(1) and DHA(4) both increased the pH of Hoagland's solutions. DHA(1) more severely decreased the soluble protein levels in shoots than DHA(4) in the 1:2:1 MMWCNT and 4:2:1 MMWCNT treatments. DHA(1) and DHA(4) both increased the chlorophyll concentrations of amaranth treated with MWCNTs, decreased the chlorophyll concentrations in the MMWCNT treatments. Co-exposure of DHAs and carbon-based CNTs caused further decreases in the anthocyanin level as compared to the respective CNT alone treatment. In the nanomaterial alone treatment, both 0.25 and 4:2:1 MMWCNTs greatly lowered the anthocyanin level as compared to the other two CNTs with the same exposure dose. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that the interaction between 4:2:1 MMWCNT and DHA(4) had more serious effects on plant cells across all the treatments.

AB In this work, we firstly tested five spatial repellent pyrethroids, meperfluthrin, dimefluthrin, heptafluthrin, metofluthrin and transfluthrin, to determine the susceptibility of pyrethroids to field strains of Culex quinque-fasciatus using adult topical bioassay. The results showed that though field strains exhibited the highest resistance to dimefluthrin among the selected five pyrethroids, it still can be considered low resistance in the scale of Cui et al. (2006; 2007). Then, the aim of this study was to optimise the synergistic efficacy of essential oils combined with dimefluthrin and explore the major contribution composition of eucalyptus oil, basil oil and cinnamon oil as natural synergist of dimefluthrin against the field populations of C. quinquefasciatus. GC-MS analysis showed 1,8-cineole, eugenol and trans-cinnamaldehyde were the main chemical components of eucalyptus oil, basil oil and cinnamon oil, respectively. The results of bioactivity showed that eucalyptus oil and 1,8-cineole have highly fumigant knock-down activity to the adults, showing KT50 (the median knockdown time) of 5.76 and 4.27 min at the concentration of 24.2 mu L/L; basil oil and eugenol, cinnamon oil and trans-cinnamaldehyde have highly fumigant toxicity to the adults, showing LD50 of 1.00 and 0.79, 1.26 and 1.03 mu L/L, respectively. Three effective main essential oil components were selected to prepare binary mixtures, which combined with dimefluthrin against the field population of Culex quinquefasciatus. 1,8-cineole + eugenol (9:1, w/w), 1,8-cineole + trans-cinnamaldehyde (1:1, w/w) and trans-cinnamaldehyde + eugenol (9:1, w/w) combined with dimefluthrin (10:1, w/w) were the most synergistic interaction, showed SR (synergistic ratio) values of 1.2471, 1.5709 and 1.1969; KT50 of 11.68, 9.51 and 10.67 min respectively, by quadrate box method. In addition, to validate the stable synergistic interaction of 1,8-cineole + trans-cinnamaldehyde (1:1, w/w) combined with dimefluthrin (10:1, w/w), the SR values were about 1.3, and KT50 values were 38.72-50.26 min by simulated house method. Overall, our results pointed out the promising potential of these essential oils to increase the efficacy of dimefluthrin. It might be expected that these essential oils could be developed to a useful botanical synergist of dimefluthrin for the control of the field populations of C. quinquefasciatus.

AB The hierarchically porous carbons were prepared from cellulose by a one-step method and studied as dyeadsorbents using chrysoidine as a model. With the increase of holding temperature, the prepared porous carbons had larger specific surface area and became more effective. Kinetic analysis revealed that adsorption kinetics obeyed the pseudo-second order kinetic model and adsorption equilibrium could reach within 1 h. The studies on isotherm indicated that the adsorption process could be best described by the Langmuir isotherm model and the maximum adsorption capacities was 598.8 mg g(-1). Thermodynamic parameters demonstrated that the adsorption process was exothermic and spontaneous. Moreover, the porous carbon could effectively remove some other common dyes. Importantly, the prepared porous carbon was able to remove 98% of chrysoidine from polluted river water and its adsorption efficiency was inappreciably influenced by the water matrix. These results shown that the hierarchically porous carbons synthesized from biomass in this study had a wide application in water treatment.

AB In this work, the efficiencies of Fenton catalytic and sonolysis processes were investigated separately and in combination together for the treatment and reduction of sludge volume. Moreover, the effects of operating parameters such as retention time, initial pH, iron concentration, and H2O2 concentration on COD reduction as well as the proportion of volatile solids to total solids (VS/TS) were studied. Finally, the effects of these processes on the sludge volume index (SVI) and sludge volume reduction (SVR) were evaluated. According to the results, the retention time of 60 min, pH = 3, hydrogen peroxide concentration of 0.13 M/L, and iron concentration of 2 mM/L were achieved as the optimum values. Furthermore, the SVR and SVI removal efficiencies in the Fenton process were 19% and 25%, respectively, but the removal efficiency in sonolysis process was very low and can be ignored. Under optimum conditions in sono-Fenton (SF) process, the SVR and SVI removal efficiencies were 55.7% and 83%, respectively. The results showed that by combining sonolysis and Fenton processes; due to the synergistic effect of ultrasonic waves, Fenton agent, and the production of more hydroxyl radicals; the COD removal efficiency increased to 77%, and the proportion of VS/TS in row activated sludge was reduced from 75% to 26%. Generally, by combining sonolysis and Fenton processes, the removal efficiency increased significantly as compared to separate processes owing to the production of more oxidizing agents and improving mass transfer.

AB Epidemiological studies have associated ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure with lung cancer, in which epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an initial process. Thus, it is important to identify the key molecule or pathway involved in the PM2.5 induced EMT. Human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells were exposed to PM2.5 (100 or 500 mu g/ml) for 30 passages and analyzed by metabolomics to identify the alteration of metabolites related to PM2.5 exposure. The expression levels of EMT markers were evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays in HBE cells and murine lung tissues. Reduced epithelial markers, increased mesenchymal markers expression levels and increased capacity of metastasis were observed in PM2.5-exposed HBE cells. Metabolomics analysis suggested upregulation of citrate acid with fold change (FC) of 2.89 or 4.18 in 100 or 500 mu g/ml PM2.5 treated HBE cells. For both of the in vitro and in vivo study, the up-regulation of ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) was confirmed following PM2.5 exposure. Importantly, ACLY knockdown in HBE cells reversed EMT, migration and invasion capacities in HBE cells induced by PM2.5. Taken together, our data suggest that inhibition of ACLY demonstrates a protection against PM2.5-induced EMT, providing a concern on the molecular mechanisms of PM2.5-associated pulmonary disorders.

AB The ecological health of aquaculture water is threatened by wasted fish feed and herbicides. In order to study the effect of prometryn and fish feed on Microcystis aeruginosa growth based on Monod and Logistic functions, four different concentrations of prometryn (0, 50, 100 and 200 mu g L-1) and two different dosages of fish feed (0.075 g, 0.15 g; d < 0.85 mm) were added into the culture medium, and the fish feed was the source of nitrogen and phosphorus in the MII medium. Results showed that Microcystis aeruginosa growth can be fitted well by Logistic and modified Logistic functions with 0-200 mu g L-1 prometryn (R-2 = 0.981-0.998 and R-2 = 0.989-0.999, respectively). With the same concentration of prometryn, the maximum algae density (N-max) of Microcystis aeruginosa calculated by both Logistic and modified Logistic functions increased with increasing dosage of fish feed and with the same dosage of fish feed, N-max declined with increasing concentrations of prometryn. Inhibition of prometryn on algae growth stimulated by fish feed is of double concentration-dependence, inhibition rates (I) are lower in 0.15 g fish feed medium than 0.75 g ones generally, implying that more nutrients can alleviate the stress caused by prometryn on algae. Derived formula for the specific growth rate, growth rate and inhibition rate using modified Logistic function agreed reasonably well with measured data. Jointly application of modified Monod and Logistic functions can better describe the relationship between specific growth rates and nutrients concentrations compared to combination of Monod and Logistic functions. In addition, equations for describing variations of nutrients concentrations (PO43--P and NH4+-N) with time were also derived based on both modified Monod and Logistic functions, which agree reasonably well with the measured data. In sum, the combination of modified Monod and Logistic functions provides a promising and robust method in studying algal growth stimulated by fish feed in incubator experiments.

AB Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) levels were assessed in the liver and muscle of two data-deficient threatened dolphin species, the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus, n = 4) and the Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis, n = 6), sampled off the Southeastern Brazilian coast. PCB concentrations were greater in liver compared to muscle, with males presenting higher concentrations than females. The three main detected PCB congeners were PCBs 138, 153 and 180. A predominance of hexa-chlorinated congeners was observed, followed by hepta- and penta-PCBs. For both species, Cl 3 and Cl 4 levels were higher in muscle compared to liver, while Cl 5 to Cl 8 and Sigma PCBs were higher in liver. PBDE concentrations were significantly higher in Atlantic spotted dolphin muscle and liver compared to bottlenose dolphins. Similarly to PCBs, the highest PBDE concentrations were observed in males. The presence of PBDE congeners BDE-47, -100 and -99 in the muscle and liver of both species suggests the existence of a pollution source in Brazil by a penta-BDE mixture, as PBDEs have never been produced in Brazil. Interspecific PCB and PBDE profiles were very similar, which may be related to the similar characteristics of the analyzed species, mainly geographic distribution and life and feeding habits. This study furthers knowledge on environmental PCB and PBDE contamination, assisting in the establishment of dolphin population conservation strategies. In addition, this study calls into question the current threshold values established for PCBs and PBDEs, and demonstrates the lack of information and knowledge in this regard for cetaceans.

AB Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) were seasonally investigated in the surface water of the Xiangjiang River (south China) in order to understand their spatio-temporal distribution, source apportionment, and ecological risks. The occurrence of 21 EDCs were determined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in the water samples collected along the river over four seasons, and the results were statistically analyzed. The concentrations of progestagens, androgens, estrogens ranged from not detected (ND) to 98.3 ng L-1; while the concentrations of alkylphenols ranged from 0.8 to 3.1 x 10(3) ng L-1; and that of caffeine ranged from 0.1 to 49.8 ng L-1. The detection frequencies of bisphenol A, 4-tert-octylphenol, 4-n-nonylphenol, estrone, and 17 beta-estradiol were 95-100% during the four sampling campaigns. The seasonal and spatial variation trend of EDCs in the Xiangjiang River was noticeable. The concentration of EDCs in Yueyang section (downstream) was the highest in winter, while the concentration in Yongzhou (upstream) section was the lowest in spring. The concentration of EDCs in the Xiangjiang River was significantly correlated with the levels of the total organic carbon, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen. Source analysis indicated that untreated sewage was the major source of EDCs. Furthermore, the potential risks of EDCs in the surface water to aquatic organisms were assessed with the risk quotient method (European Commission, 2003), and the results indicated the highest ecological risk of 17 beta-estradiol in the Xiangjiang River.

AB Heavy metal (HM) pollution in agricultural soils due to the recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) has become a serious concern, but most farmers cannot afford the economic losses of fallow land during remediation. Thus, it is imperative to produce low-HM crops while remediating the contaminated soils. A 17-week pot experiment was conducted to investigate the growth and HM (Cd, Cu, Pb, Cr, Zn, and Ni) acquisition of garlic chives (Allium tuberosum Rottl. ex Spreng.) intercropped with sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and inoculated with (I+M) or without (I-M) the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Funneliformis caledonium on a severely HM-contaminated soil that was collected from a WEEE-recycling site. Compared with the monoculture control, the I-M treatment significantly (P < 0.05) decreased Cd, Cu, Cr, Zn, and Ni concentrations in the shoots of chives through rhizosphere competition and HM (except Cr) transfer from the root to the shoot of chives, and increased the average shoot fresh weight (i.e., yield) of chives by 794% by alleviating HM toxicity. Compared with the I-M treatment, the I+M treatment significantly increased soil phosphatase activity as well as root mycorrhizal colonization of both sunflower and chives. The I+M treatment had no effect on the tissue P concentration of sunflower but elevated the average dry biomass (shoot plus root) and P acquisition level of sunflower by 179% and 121%, respectively. In addition, the I+M treatment significantly increased the P concentration in the root rather than in the shoot of chives and significantly increased the level of P acquisition by chives, increasing the average yield of chives by 229%. Simultaneously, the I+M treatment significantly increased the level of HM (except Cd) acquisition by sunflower, enhancing the rhizosphere competition by sunflower over chives, and further reducing the transfer of all six HMs from root to shoot in the chives, and inducing significant decreases in chive shoot HM concentrations compared with the monoculture control. Furthermore, the I(+M )treatment decreased the average total concentrations and increased the average DTPA-extractable concentrations of soil HMs. The results demonstrate the multifunctional role of AM fungi in the intercropping system for both vegetable production and phytoremediation on HM-contaminated soils.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were immobilized and cross-linked by high-gluten flour (HGF), and a series of biomass-GO composites with various HGF-to-GO mass ratios were fabricated through a one-step hydrothermal method. The HGF-GO composites were used as novel adsorbents to adsorb rare earth ions (REE3+: La3+, Yb3+, Y3+, Er3+ and Nd3+) from aqueous solutions, and their adsorption properties were also investigated detailly. To evaluate the physicochemical properties of HGF-GO composites and further understand the mechanisms of adsorption of REE3+ onto HGF-GO composites, the HGF-GO composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA), Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Several important condition parameters including contact time, initial REE3+ concentrations, solution pH values and temperature that might affect the adsorption process were studied in detail. The maximum adsorption capacities of HGF-GO(1:1) composite toward La3+, Yb3+, Y3+, Er3+ and Nd3+ were 30.32, 36.64, 32.84, 42.36 and 48.68 mg g(-1), respectively. The experimental data indicated that the adsorption of FtEE(3+) onto HGF-GO(1:1) was well fitted by the pseudo-second order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm model, and the adsorption process was a spontaneous and endothermic reaction. The HGF-GO(1:1) composite could be well regenerated and reused after five adsorption-desorption cycles, and its removal efficiency for Yb3+ remained as a constant of 100%.

AB The design of environmentally friendlier solvents has gained increasing relevance in the last decade. Deep eutectic solvents (DES) have recently emerged, with advantages like low-cost and putative lower environmental impact. However, information about DES toxicity is still scarce. This work aims to contribute to profiling the ecotoxicity of DES based on cholinium chloride ([Chol]Cl). Six DES were addressed, combining [Chol]Cl (as hydrogen bond acceptor HBA) with ethylene glycol, glycerol, 1,2-propanediol, propionic acid, 1-propanol, and urea as hydrogen bond donors (HBD), in different molar ratios. The Microtox (R). Acute Toxicity Test, was used for assessing their toxicity towards the marine bacteria Allivibrio fischeri. Because the dissociation of DES in water is expected, analysis appraising the mixtures toxicity theory should be considered, which is a step forward in this field. This analysis suggested that [Chol]Cl and all HBD with the exception of propionic acid:[Chol]Cl 1:2 and 4:1 behave antagonistically, which is contrary to what has been suggested previously. The most extreme cases are Urea: [Chol]Cl and 1-Propanol:[Chol]Cl, with EC50 values higher than their starting materials dosed singly, configuring very promising and biocompatible alternative solvents. Toxicity was found to be dependent on DES composition, as well as on molar proportions of the starting materials.

AB Sugarcane vinasse is a residue generated at a rate fifteen times greater than the ethanol production. Because of its high organic and micronutrient content, this residue is used as a fertilizer on sugarcane crops. However, when used in large quantities, vinasse can saturate the soil and contaminate nearby water resources by percolation and leaching. Given the proven toxic potential of in natura vinasse, the present study aimed to evaluate the toxic potential of leached sugarcane vinasse using Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as a test organism. A bioassay was performed after vinasse percolation in laboratory soil columns. The bioassay included one control group containing fresh water and two treatment groups, the first exposed to a 2,5% dilution of leached of vinasse and the second to a 2,5% dilution of in natura vinasse. After exposure, histopathological analysis was performed in gills and livers, and the latter were labelled for HSP70 proteins. No significant changes were detected in the gills of the exposed fish. However, in the liver, both in natura and leached vinasse induced statistically significant histopathological changes. These changes include hydropic degeneration, cell boundary losses, pyknotic nuclei and cellular disorganization. HSP70 expression significant increase in liver of both treatment groups were observed, being higher for the in natura vinasse exposed group. Results suggested that both leached vinasse and in natura vinasse were toxic, its still able to provoke histological changes and induce the cytoprotective response in exposed fish liver, evidenced by a immunostaining of cellular stress proteins. Thus, in order to reduce its environmental impact, appropriated effluent disposal is essential.

AB Aluminum is a major limiting abiotic factor for plant growth and productivity on acidic soils. The primary disorder of aluminum toxicity is the rapid cessation of root elongation. The root apex is the most sensitive part of this organ. Although significant literature evidence and hypothesis exist on aluminum toxicity, the explicit mechanism through which aluminum ceases root growth is still indefinable. The mechanisms of tolerance in plants have been the focus of intense research. Some plant species growing on acidic soils have developed tolerance mechanisms to overcome and mitigate aluminum toxicity, either by avoiding entry of Al3+ into roots (exclusion mechanism) or by being able to counterbalance toxic AL(3+) engrossed by the root system (internal tolerance mechanism). Genes belonging to ALMT (Aluminum-activated malate transporter) and MATE (Multidrug and toxin compounds extrusion) have been identified that are involved in the aluminum-activated secretion of organic acids from roots. However, different plant species show different gene expression pattern. On the other hand, boron (B) (indispensable micronutrient) is a promising nutrient in the tolerance to aluminum toxicity. It not only hinders the adsorption of aluminum to the cell wall but also improves plant growth. This review mainly explains the critical roles of organic acid and B-induced tolerance to aluminum by summarizing the mechanisms of ALMT, MATE, internal detoxification, molecular traits and genetic engineering of crops.

AB The quality of soils under different land uses is getting deteriorated throughout the world due to various anthropogenic activities. This deterioration is highly complex in riverine floodplain areas due to contamination by multiple point and non-point sources and change in seasons. Therefore, a study was conducted to analyze seasonal (pre and post-monsoon) variations in physico-chemical characteristics, contents of metal(loid)s (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb and Zn) in riverine floodplain soils under three land uses (agricultural, riverbank and roadside) from areas around the rivers Beas and Sutlej in Punjab, India. Further, analysis was done to assess the ecological and genotoxic risks (Miura cepa genotoxicity assay) posed by metal(loid)s in these soils. It was observed that soil samples under the three land uses were slightly alkaline (pre-monsoon) to acidic (post-monsoon) in nature with sandy texture and low soil organic matter. The levels of most metal(loid)s increased in post-monsoon soil samples under the three land uses, which was attributed to increase in soil organic matter, silt and clay contents in post-monsoon samples due to precipitation, flooding and sedimentation. The ecological Risk Index (58.3-104.5) and Modified Risk Index (145.2-178.9) calculated to analyze the level of ecological risks of metal(loid)s revealed that As, Cd and Sb posed moderate to considerable ecological risks in the agricultural and roadside soils in both seasons. Allium cepa genotoxicity assay indicated that the metal(loid)s in studied soils can cause genotoxic effects in biological systems. Therefore, various steps such as reduction in use of agrochemicals, promotion of organic agricultural methods and decontamination of soils using techniques such as phytoremediation etc must be taken to ensure reduction and containment of metal(loid)s in such riverine floodplain areas.

AB Halophytic plants play a fundamental role in salt marshes, influencing their structure, dynamics, and cycling of nutrients and minerals. These plants have the ability to retain metals in the soil, or absorb and retain them in underground structures, or transport them to their aerial structures. Here we aim to study shape variation in the leaves of Cressa truxillensis inhabiting the salt marsh of San Antonio Oeste, according to their proximity to a source of metals in the soil. A gradient of bioavailability of metal was observed in the soil, decreasing from the site closest to the source to the most distant point, where Zn was the most abundant metal followed by Pb and Cu. We used landmark-based geometric morphometric tools to study leaf shape variation. We observed more oval leaf growth on the farthest point of the pollutant's source, and lanceolate shape close to it. No significant among-site size differences were found. Collectively, these results suggest that the stress conditions associated with the soil metals' concentration generate changes in the leaf shape of Cressa trwcilensis. Considering that this species has not been extensively analyzed, this study establishes a baseline and supports the use of the leaf as an early biomarker of stress by contamination in plants associated with marshes.

AB An efficient phenol-degrading bacterial strain, belonging to Acinetobacter genus, was isolated and selected to study the impact of different environmentally relevant phenol concentrations on the degradation process. The bacterial isolate, labeled as Acinetobacter sp. SA01 was able to degrade the maximum phenol concentration of 1 g/l during 60 h at optimum condition of pH 7, 30 degrees C and 180 rpm. Aeration and initial cell density, the two important factors, were carefully examined in the optimal growth conditions. The results showed that these two variables related proportionally with phenol degradation rate. Further investigations showed no effect of inoculum size on the enhancement of degradation of phenol at over 1 g/l. Flow cytometry (FCM) study was performed to find out the relationship between phenol-induced damages and phenol degradation process. Single staining using propidium iodide (PI) showed increased cell membrane permeability with an increase of phenol concentration, while single staining with carboxyfluorescein diacetate (cFDA) demonstrated a considerable reduction in esterase activity of the cells treated with phenol at more than 1 g/l. A detailed investigation of cellular viability using concurrent double staining of cFDA/PI revealed that the cell death increases in cells exposed to phenol at more than 1 g/l. The rate of cell death was low but noticeable in the presence of phenol concentration of 2 g/l, over time. Phenol at concentrations of 3 and 4 g/l caused strong toxicity in living cells of Acinetobacter sp. SA01. The plate count method and microscopy analysis of the cells treated with phenol at 1.5 and 2 g/l confirmed an apparent reduction in cell number over time. It was assumed that the phenol concentrations higher than 1 g/l have destructive effects on membrane integrity of Acinetobacter sp. SA01. Our results also revealed that the toxicity did not reduce by increasing initial cell density. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination of bacterial cells revealed the surface morphological changes following exposure to phenol. The bacterial cells, with wizened appearance and wrinkled surface, were observed by exposing to phenol (1 g/l) at lag phase. A morphological change occurred in the mid-logarithmic phase as the bacterial cells demonstrated coccobacilli form as well as elongated filamentous shape. The wrinkled cell surface were totally disappeared in mid-stationary phase, suggesting that the complete degradation of phenol relieve the stress and direct bacterial cells toward possessing smoother cell membrane.

AB This study investigated the total concentrations and bioaccessibility of heavy metals in edible tissues and trophic levels of 12 marine organism species in the South China Sea. The results were used to estimate health risks to humans. Of the heavy metals detected, nickel (Ni) was present at the highest concentrations, followed in descending, order by iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb). Cd had the highest percentage bioaccessibility (61.91%). There were no correlations between log-transformed total metal concentrations and trophic level values, nor between log-transformed bioaccessibility metal concentrations and trophic level values. This indicates there is no biomagnification among these trace metals. The carcinogenic risk probabilities for Pb and Cr to urban and rural residents were below the acceptable level (< 1 x 10(-4)). The target hazard quotient (THQ) value for each metal and the total THQ values for all metals studied indicated no significant risk of non-carcinogenic effects to urban and rural residents from consuming marine organisms from the South China Sea.

AB The potential importance of Juncus acutus for remediation of Zn-contaminated lands has been recognized, because of its Zn tolerance and capacity to accumulate Zn. Since it is also a halophyte, the extent to which salinity influences its Zn tolerance requires investigation. A factorial greenhouse experiment was designed to assess the effect of NaCl supply (0 and 85 mM NaCl) on the growth, photosynthetic physiology and tissue ions concentrations of plants exposed to 0, 30 and 100 mM Zn. Our results indicated that NaCl supplementation alleviated the effects of Zn toxicity on growth, as Zn at 100 mM reduced relative growth rate (RGR) by 60% in the absence of NaCl but by only 34% in plants treated also with NaCl. This effect was linked to a reduction in Zn tissue concentrations, as well as to overall protective effects on various stages in the photosynthetic pathway. Thus, at 85 mM NaCl plants were able to maintain higher net photosynthesis (A(N)) than in the absence of added NaCl, although there were no differences in stomatal conductance (g(s)). This contributed to preserving the trade-off between CO2 acquisition and water loss, as indicated by higher intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE). Hence, A(N) differences were ascribed to limitation in the RuBisCO carboxylation, manifested as higher intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i), together with dysfunction of PSII photochemistry (in term of light harvest and energy excess dissipation), as indicated by higher chronic photoinhibition percentages and variations in the photosynthetic pigment profiles in presence of Zn under non-saline conditions.

AB Furan is a common food contaminant and environmental pollutant. Spirulina platensis (SP) is a blue-green algae extensively used as therapeutic and health supplements. This study aimed to explore the probable beneficial role of SP against the influence of furan on reproductive system of male rats. Adult male rats were divided into control, vehicle control, SP (300 mg/kg bwt/ day, 7 days), furan (16 mg/kg bwt/ day,30 day), SP/furan, furan/SP and furan + SP groups. Hematology, sperm count, sperm morphology, serum testosterone (TES), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E2) levels, reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), testicular enzymes, and pro inflammatory cytokines were estimated. In addition, histopathology of testis and seminal vesicles and apoptosis were evaluated. Anaemia, leukocytosis, and reduced gonadosomatic index were observed in the furan treated group. TES, LH, FSH, E2, and GSH were significantly decreased following furan treatment. MDA, testicular enzymes, and pro inflammatory cytokines were significantly incremented in testis of furan treated rats. Furan induced apoptic changes in testis. SP significantly counteracted furan reprotoxic impacts, particularly at co-exposure. Conclusively, these findings verified that SP could be candidate therapy against furan reprotoxic impacts.

AB Efficient fuelling is essential for migratory birds because fuel loads and fuelling rates affect individual fitness and survival during migration. Many migrant shorebirds are exposed to oil pollution and its toxic constituents, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), at migratory staging sites, which has the potential to interfere with avian refuelling physiology. In this study, we orally dosed shorebirds with environmentally-relevant PAH mixtures to simulate dietary exposure during staging. Forty-nine wild-caught Sanderling (Calidris alba) were exposed to 0 (control), 12.6 (low), 126 (medium), or 1260 (high) mu g total PAH/kg body weight/day. Birds were dosed during a 21-day period of autumn pre-migratory fuelling to mimic the typical staging duration of Sanderling. We measured daily changes in mass and fat loads, as well as ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, serum biochemical profiles, and liver mass and lipid content following dosing. All dose groups gained fat and increased in mass (size-corrected) during the study period, with females having a higher average body mass than males. However, mass gain was 3.9, 5.4, and 3.8 times lower in the low, medium, and high dose groups, respectively, relative to controls, and body mass in the medium and high dose groups significantly declined near the end of the experiment. EROD activity showed a dose-dependent increase and was significantly elevated in the high dose group relative to controls. Higher individual EROD activity was associated with reduced serum bile acid and elevated serum creatine kinase concentrations in both sexes, and with elevated serum lipase concentrations in females. These results suggest that PAH exposure in Sanderling can interfere with mechanisms of lipid transport and metabolism, can cause muscle damage, and can lead to reduced overall fat loads that are critical to staging duration, departure decisions, migratory speed, and flight range. Given that many shorebirds migrate thousands of kilometers between the breeding and wintering grounds and frequently aggregate at key staging sites that are subject to contamination, PAH exposure likely represents a significant threat to shorebird migratory success.

AB The present study was aimed to check the mosquitocidal activity of intracellular methanol extract fractions and the compound di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate isolated from Streptomyces rimosus. The isolated compound was also analyzed for its interaction with Acetylcholinesterase (AChE1). The larvae and eggs of Culex quinquefasciatus were exposed to four different concentrations such as 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10 ppm for fractions and 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 ppm for compound. After 24 and 120 h post treatment, the larval mortality and ovicidal activity were recorded. Fractions collected from the intracellular methanol extract were tested for larvicidal activity; among them Fraction 4 was found to be the active fraction. Fraction 4 showed 74% larvicidal activity with LC50 and LC90 values of 6.9 and 17.2 ppm, respectively, in 24 h against the larvae of Cx. quinquefasciatus. Fraction 4 showed 95% ovicidal activity at 10 ppm concentration after 120 h post treatment. The eluted compound di(2ethylhexyl) phthalate was highly toxic and exhibited promising activity against the eggs of Cx. quinquefasciatus. The compound presented 94% ovicidal activity at 2.0 ppm concentration after 120 h post treatment. The larvae of Cx. quinquefasciatus were exposed to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate which showed good activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The compound showed 76% larvicidal activity against the larvae of Cx. quinquefasciatus with LC50 and LC90 values of 1.22 and 3.28 ppm, respectively, at 2 ppm concentration in 24 h. Fraction 4 and the compound were subjected to toxicity study against non-target organism and were found to be nontoxic. The present studies revealed that the treated larvae showed serious damage in the midgut cells. Growth disruption and larval deformities were observed in compound-treated larvae. The compound was highly active and inhibited AChE in a concentration-dependent manner. Computational analysis of the compound had strong interaction with AChE1 of Cx. quinquefasciatus. These results clearly showed that Fraction 4 and the compound isolated from S. rimosus can be used to control the life stages of Cx. quinquefasciatus; it will be a good alternative to synthetic insecticides.

AB The existing form of an ionizable organic compound can simultaneously affect its soil adsorption and plant bioactivity. In this experiment, the adsorption and bioactivity of two weak acid herbicides (WAHs), imazethapyr and 2,4-D, were studied to explore the predominant mechanism by which the soil pH and the addition of biochar can influence the phytotoxicity of WAHs in soil. Then, the WAH concentration extracted by hollow fiber-based liquid-phase microextraction (CHF-LPME), the in situ pore water concentration (C-IPW) and the added concentration (C-AC) were employed to estimate the phytotoxicity. The results showed that with increased pH from 5.5 to 8.5, the phytotoxicity of the WAHs to rice increased about 1-fold in the soil, but decreased in aqueous solutions, the IC50 values for imazethapyr and 2,4-D at pH 5.0 were 3- and 2-fold higher than that at pH 8.0. In addition, the soil adsorption decreased, indicating that the adsorption process was the dominant factor for the variation of the phytotoxicity of the WAHs in the tested soil instead of the decreasing bioactivity. The concentration that inhibits plant growth by 50% (IC50) calculated by the C-AC in different pH and biochar soils ranged from 0.619 to 3.826 mg/kg for imazethapyr and 1.871-72.83 mg/kg for 2,4-D. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the IC(50 )values reached 65.61% for imazethapyr and 130.0% for 2,4-D. However, when IC50 was calculated by C-IPW and CHF-LPME, the CVs of the IC50 values decreased to 23.51% and 36.23% for imazethapyr and 40.21% and 50.93% for 2,4-D, respectively. These results suggested that C-IPW and CHF-LPME may be more appropriate than C-AC for estimating the phytotoxicity of WAHs.

AB Most studies have assessed the toxicity of pristine NPs to plants without considering the likely changes that these NPs will undergo during their residence time in the soil. In this study, we assessed the effects of ZnO NPs (3, 20, and 225 mg Zn kg(-1) soil) aged for a year in soil and after a previous crop on the Zn availability in soil, leaf accumulation and toxicity to green pea (Pisum sativum L.) and beet root (Beta vulgar-is L). The effects were compared to bulk ZnO and ZnSO4 in two agricultural soils with different pH under greenhouse conditions. The Zn concentration in the plant leaf was 6-12-fold higher in acidic than in calcareous soil that could explain the different effects on plants caused by Zn applications depending on soil type. Thus, in acidic soil, ZnO NPs promoted ROS generation in both plant species with increases from 47% to 130%, increased the MDA content in pea up to 58 +/- 8% in plant exposed to ZnSO4 at 225 mg Zn kg(-1) soil and altered the ratio of photosynthetic pigments in beet between 12% and 41%, suggesting distressed chloroplast constituents. In calcareous soil, the changes seemed to be related to the supply of Zn in Zn deficient soils, whose principal effect was the 20-65% decrease of ROS levels in treated plants. The available and leaf Zn concentrations did not differ among Zn sources. Likewise, ZnO NPs showed comparable toxic or stimulatory effects to ZnO bulk and Zn salt, with some exceptions where Zn ion showed the highest phytotoxicity and effectiveness as a micronutrient. According to our results, we cannot affirm that NPs pose a higher potential environmental risk than their bulk counterparts after one-year of residence time in soil.

AB Globally, nitrogen deposition increment has caused forest structural changes due to imbalanced plant nitrogen metabolism and subsequent carbon assimilation. Here, a 2 consecutive-year experiment was conducted to reveal the effects of canopy addition of nitrogen (CAN) on nitrogen absorption, assimilation, and allocation in leaves of three subtropical forest woody species (Castanea henryi, Ardisia quinquegona, and Blastus cochinchinensis). We hypothesized that CAN altered leaf nitrogen absorption, assimilation and partitioning of different plants in different ways in subtropical forest. It shows that CAN increased maximum photosynthetic rate (A.), photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE), and metabolic protein content of the two understory species A. quinquegona and B. cochinchinensis. By contrary, for the overstory species, C. henryi, A, PNUE, and metabolic protein content were significantly reduced in response to CAN. We found that changes in leaf nitrogen metabolism were mainly due to the differences in enzyme (e.g. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase and glutamine synthetase) activities under CAN treatment. Our results indicated that C. henryi may be more susceptible to CAN treatment, and both A. quinquegona and B. cochinchinensis could better adapt to CAN treatment but in different ways. Our findings may partially explain the ongoing degradation of subtropical forest into a community dominated by small trees and shrubs in recent decades. It is possible that persistent high levels of atmospheric nitrogen deposition will lead to the steady replacement of dominant woody species in this subtropical forest.

AB Using sequential soil and liquid culture enrichments with cyprodinil as the sole carbon source, a Gram-negative cyprodinil-degrader from cyprodinil-polluted agricultural soil was isolated. The sequencing analysis of 16 S rRNA indicated that the strain showed 99% homology to Acinetobacter sp. The strain could effectively degrade cyprodinil at the neutral condition. At the initial concentrations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg L-1 in minimal medium, cyprodinil was degraded by 10, 20, 49.3, 64.2, 57 and 24 mg L-1 within 14 days, respectively. Two metabolites (4-cyclopropyl-6-methyl-2-pyrimidpyridine amine and monohydroxylated para-substitution) were identified using high performance liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS). A biodegradation pathway involving imines hydrolysis and monohydroxyl substitution on benzene ring was proposed on basis of the identified metabolites. Acinetobacter sp. would have a potential application in bioremediation of cyprodinil-contaminated soil, and the strain might have important implications in detoxification and bioremediation of pyrimidine analogues.

AB This paper presents, for the first time, results for chlorpyrifos (CHLP) in Polish fruits and vegetables over the course of a long period of research, 2007-2016, with toxicological aspects. The challenge of this study was to re-evaluate the impact of chlorpyrifos residues in fruit and vegetables on health risk assessed via acute and chronic exposure based on old and new, lower, established values of: Average Daily Intakes (ADIs)/Acute Reference Doses (ARfDs) and Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs). A total of 3 530 samples were collected, and CHLP in the range of 0.005-1.514 mg/kg was present in 10.2% of all samples. The MRL was exceeded in 0.7% of all samples (MRL established in 2009-2015), and recalculation yielded a much greater number of violations for the new MRL (2016), which exceeded 2.9% of all samples. Acute exposure to CHLP calculated according to the old, higher toxicological data (0.10 mg/kg bw/day), does not exceed 14% of its respective ARfDs for adults and both groups of children, but when calculated for incidental cases according to the current value (ARID 0.005 mg/kg bw) for infants and toddlers, was above 100% of its respective ARfDs in: white cabbage (263.65% and 108.24%), broccoli (216.80% and 194.72%) and apples (153.20% and 167.70%). The chronic exposure calculated for both newly established ADI values (0.001 mg/kg bw/day and 0.100 mg/kg bw/day) appears to be relatively low for adults and children.

AB Freshwater pulmonate snails are sensitive to trace metals, but to date, the sensitivity of estuarine pulmonate snails to these important environmental toxicants is undescribed. Using the estuarine mud snail Amphibola crenate, effects of a 48-h exposure to waterborne cadmium (Cd) were investigated. The 48-h median lethal concentration (LC50) was 50.4 mg L-1, a value higher than that previously reported for any gastropod mollusc. Cadmium levels in the tissues of mud snails were highest in the viscera (digestive gland and gonad), with the foot muscle and remaining tissue compartment (kidney, mantle, remaining digestive tissues and heart) displaying significantly lower concentrations. Over a Cd exposure concentration range of 0-32 mg L-1, Amphibola exhibited reduced oxygen consumption and elevated ammonia excretion in response to increasing Cd, the latter effect likely reflecting a switch to protein metabolism. This finding was supported by a declining oxygen: nitrogen ratio (O:N) as exposure Cd concentration increased. Other energy imbalances were noted, with a decrease in tissue glycogen (an effect strongly correlated with Cd burden in the viscera and foot muscle) and an elevated haemolymph glucose observed. An increase in catalase activity in the visceral tissues was recorded, suggestive of an effect of Cd on oxidative stress. The magnitude of this effect was correlated with tissue Cd burden. The induction of antioxidant defence mechanisms likely prevented an increase in levels of lipid peroxidation, which were unchanged relative to Cd exposure concentration in all measured tissues.

AB In amphipods, growth, development and reproduction are mediated by the molt, which is a hormonally controlled process and which, therefore, could be impacted by endocrine disruption compounds (EDC). The molt process is controlled by both X-organ (XO) and Y-organ (YO) through a variety of hormones and receptors including the molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) and the ecdysteroid receptor (EcR). However, although many studies were devoted to characterize MIH and EcR in crustaceans, only few works evaluated their variations under EDCs exposures. Consequently, the present work aimed to characterize MIH and EcR genes of the amphipod Garrunarus pulex, as well as to study their relative expression variations after exposure to four EDCs, proved in vertebrates: ethinylestradiol (estrogen), 4-hydroxytamoxifen (anti-estrogen), 17 alpha-methyltestosterone (androgen) and cyproterone acetate (anti-androgen).
   PCR amplification allowed to obtain 204 bp length and 255 bp length fragments, encoding for partial sequences of 68 amino acids and 85 amino acids, which correspond to EcR and MIH, respectively, and which are highly conserved in crustacean species. Results highlighted MIH and EcR expressions mainly in G. pulex head, which is the localization of XO and YO. Moreover, irrespective of the EDC exposure, increases of MIH and EcR relative expressions were observed, as it was observed after the exposure to 20-hydroxyecdysone (20HE), the natural molt hormone, used as positive control. Therefore, it appeared that tested EDCs behaved like 20HE, suggesting that their effects could occur through the ecdysteroids pathways, and so impact the molt process of G. pulex on the long term. Finally, the present study is a first step in the possibility of using MIH and EcR relative expressions as biomarkers of exposure for EDCs risk assessment. However additional studies must first be carried out to better characterize and understand their variations, and also better predicted consequences for the exposed amphipods.

AB Spongy Ni/Fe carbonate - fluorapatite was synthesized from natural phosphorite enriched with iron impurities. The morphological, chemical and structural features of the product were estimated using several techniques as XRD, SEM, EDX, and FT-IR. It exhibits spongy structure of nano and micro-pores. The average crystallite size is about 8.27 nm. The suitability of the product for considerable decontamination of Zn2+, Co2+, and Cu2+, ions from water was studied based on several reacting parameters. The equilibrium was attained after 240 min for Zn2+ and Co2+ ions while the adsorption equilibrium of Cu2+ reached after 120 min. The adsorption data for the selected metals was represented well by a pseudo-second-order model which revealed chemisorption uptake. The equilibrium studies were appraised based on traditional models and two advanced models were designed according to the statistical physical theories. The adsorption results highly fitted with Langmuir model followed rather than the other models. This indicated a monolayer adsorption for the metal ions by spongy Ni/Fe carbonate - fluorapatite. The estimated q(max) values are 149.25 mg/g, 106.4 mg/g and 147.5 mg/g for the uptake of Zn2+, Co2+, and Cu2+, respectively. Based on monolayer models of one energy and two energies, the number of receptor adsorption sites, number of adsorbed metal ions per active site, the average number of sites which occupied by ions, mono layer adsorption quantity and the adsorption quantity after total saturation were calculated for the first time for such materials.

AB Ship ballasting operations may transfer harmful aquatic organisms across global ocean. This study aims to reveal the occurrences and abundances of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and human bacterial pathogens (HBPs) in ballast tank sediments. Nine samples were collected and respectively analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing technologies. Ten ARG5 (aadA1, bIaCTX-M, bIaTEM, ermB, mefA, strB, sul1, sul2, tetM, and tetQ) and the Class-I integron gene (intI1) were highly prevalent (10(5)-10(9) gene copies/g) in ballast tank sediments. The still was the most abundant ARG with the concentration of 10(8)-10(9) copies/g and intI1 was much more abundant than the ARGs in ballast tank sediments. The strong positive correlations between intI1 and ARG5 (blaCTX-M, sul1, sul2 and tetM) indicated the potential spread of ARGs via horizontal gene transfer. In ballast tank sediments, 44 bacterial species were identified as HBPs and accounted for 0.13-21.46% of the total bacterial population although the three indicator pathogenic microbes (Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia colt, and Enterococci) proposed by the International Maritime Organization were not detected. Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, Enterococcus hirae, Shigella sonnei and Bacillus anthracis were the dominant pathogens in ballast tank sediments. Zn and P in sediments had positive effects on the ARG5. Network analysis results indicated that sul1 and sul2 genes existed in several bacterial pathogens. Ballast tank sediments could be regarded as a carrier for the migration of ARG5.

TI Tolerance of Ulothrix sp LAFIC 010 (Chlorophyta) against high

AB The production of acid mine drainage of (AMD) is one of the main phenomena responsible for much of the degradation of water and soil resources. Organisms present at sites contaminated by AMD can have the potential to bioaccumulate heavy metals, stimulating their application in bioremediation processes. Ulothrix sp. LAFIC 010 was identified among the species of algae isolated from water contaminated by AMD in the region of Sideropolis (Brazil). The present study evaluated its tolerance and bioaccumulation potential related to zinc, manganese and nickel. Experiments were performed to see the effects of different concentrations of Zn, Mn and Ni (individually and in combination) on the physiological performance of the alga. The results showed that only the cultures submitted to concentrations above 0.55 mM Zn showed a decrease in growth rate and damage to physiological processes. There was no observed effect of Mn and Ni on Ulothrix sp. LAFIC 010 physiology, even with an 8-fold increase in concentrations of these metals in the medium. In cultures with combined metals, only the treatments with the highest concentrations of Zn presented reduced growth, regardless of the presence of other metals. Additionally, we observed that Mn and Ni did not decrease the toxic effect of Zn. Mn accumulation was indicated in the cell wall and Ni in the vacuole. Our results suggest that the distribution of this alga in contaminated medium is not affected by the concentration of Ni and Mn, at least under the pH that was evaluated. We conclude that Ulothrix sp. LAFIC 010 tolerates and grows under conditions with higher metal concentrations than previously reported for AMD.

AB Four hydrochars (labeled as HC, AHC, MHC, and MAHC, respectively) were prepared by hydrothermal carbonization of bamboo with and without chlorane or followed by NaOH modification. Various techniques were adopted to characterize the physicochemical properties of hydrochars and the removal of methylene blue (MB) by these hydrochars from aqueous solution was investigated. The MB adsorption isotherm and kinetic onto MAHC and MHC can be preferably interpreted by Langmuir adsorption mode and the pseudo-second-order model, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters implied that adsorption was a spontaneous and exothermic process. The adsorption capacity of MAHC was 655.76 mg g(-1), which was 2-3 times compared to that of MHC (268.93 mg g(-1)) at 303 K. The high adsorption capacity of MAHC for MB suggests that hydrothermal carbonization in acidic medium followed by alkaline treatment has the potential application to produce efficient MB adsorbents used in wastewater treatment.

AB Aniline aerofloat (AAF), a high-toxic organic flotation reagent, is widely used in mineral processing industry. However, little information on its environmental fate is available. AAF sorption to four types of agricultural soils at low concentrations (1-10 mg/L) was investigated using batch experiments. AAF sorption kinetics involved both boundary layer diffusion and intraparticle diffusion, following pseudo-second-order kinetics with equilibrium time within 120 min. Both Langmuir and Freundlich models fitted well the AAF sorption with the former better. Sorption of AAF to soils was a spontaneous and favorable physical sorption that was controlled by ion bridge effect and hydrophobic interaction that was related to van der Waals force and pi-pi coordination based on FTIR analyses. AAF sorption was remarkably affected by soil constituents, positively correlating with the contents of organic matter and clay. The relatively higher logK(oc) values (3.53-4.66) of AAF at environmental concentrations (1-5 mg/L) imply that soils are serving as a sink of AAF from beneficiation wastewater, posing great potential risks to environment and human health.

AB The efficacy of the removal of contaminants from wastewater depends on physico-chemical properties of pollutants and the efficiency of treatment plant. Sometimes, low amounts of toxic compounds can be still present in the treated sewage. In this work we considered the effects of contaminant residues in treated wastewaters and of temperatures on Lemna minor L. Treated effluent waters were collected, analyzed and used as duckweed growth medium. In order to better understand the effects of micropollutants and seasonal variation, the plants were grown under ambient conditions for seven days in summer and winter. Relative growth rate, pigments and phenolic compounds concentrations were determined, as well as the activities of catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), guaiacol peroxidase (G-POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO).
   The pollutant concentrations varied in the two seasons, depending on the industrial and municipal activities and efficiency of treatments. Treated waters contained heavy metals, nitrogenous and phosphorus compounds, surfactants and hydrocarbons. Compared to the control, duckweed growth of treated plants decreased by 25% in summer, while in the winter due to the lower temperatures and the presence of pollutants was completely impeded. The amounts of photosynthetic pigments of treated plants were not significantly affected in the summer, while they were higher than the control in the winter when the effluent had a high nitrogen amount. High CAT activity was registered in both seasons. Treated plants had significantly lower APX activity in the summer (53%) and winter (59%) respect to the controls. The observed inhibition of the peroxidase activities in the exposed plants, confirms the controversy existing in the literature about the variability of enzymatic response in stress condition.

AB The adsorption behaviour of metals deposited on road surfaces undergo changes during dry weather periods, with the bioavailability varying compared to the original species, prior to incorporation in stormwater runoff. This study investigated the role of antecedent dry days on the transformation characteristics of Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd attached to different geochemical forms of road dust, in order to predict potential stormwater quality impacts. The study outcomes showed that the exchangeable fraction generally decreased with the increase in antecedent dry days, but the reducible, oxidisable and residual fractions increased. This implies that there is a time-dependent transformation of weakly bound metals in road dust to more persistent chemical forms. The transformation rate of metals was found to be in the order of Pb > Cu > Zn > Cd. Significant changes in metal distribution among the geochemical fractions were observed up to seven dry days, suggesting that during the initial antecedent dry days, the transformations can be relatively more significant. Among the analysed metals, Cd present on road surfaces has a higher potential for being bioavailable during the antecedent dry days.

AB We studied the extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) in the riverbed sediment along a 518 km gradient of the Ganga River receiving carbon and nutrient load from varied human sources. Also, we tested, together with substrate-driven stimulation, if the heavy metal accumulated in the sediment inhibits enzyme activities. Because pristine values are not available, we considered Dev Prayag, a least polluted site located 624 km upstream to main study stretch, as a reference site. There were distinct increases in enzyme activities in the sediment along the study gradient from Dev Prayag, however, between-site differences were in concordance with sediment carbon(C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDAase), beta-glucosidase (Glu) and protease activities showed positive correlation with C, N and P while alkaline phosphatase was found negatively correlated with P. Enzyme activities were found negatively correlated with heavy metal, although ecological risk index (4) varied with site and metal species. Dynamic fit curves showed significant positive correlation between heavy metal and microbial metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) indicating a decrease in microbial activity in response to increasing heavy metal concentrations. This study forms the first report linking microbial enzyme activities to regional scale sediment heavy metal accumulation in the Ganga River, suggests that the microbial enzyme activities in the riverbed sediment were well associated with the proportion of C, N and P and appeared to be a sensitive indicator of C, N and P accumulation in the river. Heavy metal accumulated in the sediment inhibits enzyme activities, although C rich sediment showed relatively low toxicity due probably to reduced bioavailability of the metal. The study has relevance from ecotoxicological as well as from biomonitoring perspectives.

AB Chemically assisted phytoremediation is fast gaining attention as a biotechnology to accelerate heavy metal removal from contaminated substrates, but how different chemical amendments affect the process remains an important research question. Here, bioaccumulation factor (BAF), translocation factor (TF), removal efficiency (RE) and uptake of Hg, As, Pb, Cu and Zn by cattail (Typha latifolia) and vetiver (Chrysopogon zizanioides) were quantified in a potted experiment to determine the effects of amendments on the phytoremediation success. Baseline concentrations of heavy metals within the studied mined site were determined. The experiment involved three soil treatments (each comprising 16 samples amended with 0.05 mol/L ethylene di-aminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 3 g of aluminum sulfate [Al-2(SO4)(3)], and unamended control) transplanted with equal numbers of vetiver and cattail. Growth performance (height) of plant species was monitored every two weeks. Sixteen weeks after transplanting, heavy metal levels in plant and soil samples were quantified following standard protocols, and the biomass and root length measured for each plant species. Results indicated strong negative impact of mining activities on heavy metal levels of soil in the study area. Soil amendment considerably enhanced the BAF, TF, RE and uptake but the effect varied with plant species and heavy metal in question. The amendment also stimulated strong positive correlation between RE and BAF, TF and metal uptake, and generally did not show any negative effects on plant growth performance. In general, soil amendment aided the accumulation and translocation of heavy metals in the plant species studied, and could be explored for cleaning up contaminated sites.

AB To investigate the bioavailability of thallium (Tl) in soil and rice in a Tl-contaminated area in Guangdong, China, the topsoil and rice samples were collected from 24 sampling sites and analyzed. Moreover, a modified sequential extraction procedure was applied to determine the different Tl fractions in the soil. The mean pH value of the soil samples was 4.50. The total Tl concentration in the paddy soil was about 4-8 times higher than the Canadian guideline value (1 mg kg(-1)) for agricultural land uses. The mean ecological risk index of Tl was determined to be 483, indicating that potential hazard of the paddy soil was serious. The mean content of Tl in rice was 1.42 mg kg(-1), which exceeded the German maximum permissible level (0.5 mg kg(-1)) of Tl in foods and feedstuffs by a factor of nearly 3. The hazard quotient value via rice intake was 57.6, indicating a high potential health risk to the local residents. The distribution of various Tl fractions followed the order of easily reducible fraction (40.3%) > acid exchangeable fraction (30.5%) > residual fraction (23.8%) > oxidizable fraction (5.4%). Correlation analyses showed that the easily reducible fraction correlates positively with the soil Fe and Mn contents, whereas the acid exchangeable fraction is significantly correlated with the S content. The soil pH was negatively correlated with the Tl content in both soil and rice. The Tl content in rice was more strongly correlated with the exchangeable fraction than the total Tl content in the soil. Overall, the bioavailability of Tl in more acidic soil is higher, and is strongly dependent on the speciation of Tl, especially the content of acid exchangeable fraction.

AB The effects of chronic exposure to pesticides can lead to the development of several diseases, including different types of cancer, since the genotoxic and mutagenic capacity of these substances can be observed. The objective of this study is to investigate the relation between the occupational exposure to various pesticides and the presence of DNA damage and oxidative stress. Blood samples from 50 rural workers (41 men and 9 women) exposed to pesticides, 46 controls (20 men and 26 women) from the same city (Antonio Carlos, Santa Catarina state, Brazil) and 29 controls (15 men and 14 women) from another city (Florianopolis, Santa Catarina state, Brazil), were evaluated using the comet assay and the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) technique for genetic damage, and the test of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TSARS) and catalase (CAT) activity for the oxidative stress. Cholinesterase activities were also determined, but there was no statistical difference among exposed workers and controls. Significant differences were found in DNA damage among groups. The comet assay performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes of these individuals had a significantly higher DNA damage index in the exposed group comparing to controls (p < 0.0001). MNi (p < 0.001), NBUDs (p < 0.005) and NPBs (p < 0.0001) were also found to be significantly higher in the exposed group. The TBARS values were significantly higher comparing to the Florianopolis control group (p < 0.0001). Even though CAT values were higher than controls, there was no statistical difference. Thus, it is concluded that the exposed individuals, participants of this study, are more subject to suffer genetic damage and, consequently, more susceptible to diseases resulting from such damages.

AB Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb is one of the most malignant weeds in its invision habitats. While in the cadmium-contaminated aquatic environment, does A. philoxeroides possess good tolerance and adaptability? To demonstrate the effects of cadmium on A. philoxeroides in the polluted water bodies, a hydroponic stress experiment was conducted over a gradient of Cd concentrations (0, 2.5 and 5 mg/l) in triplicate. The seedlings were cultured in a greenhouse and harvested on days 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40, respectively. The results showed the effects of mutual restraint between Cd and A. philoxeroides. The A. philoxeroides seedlings were enriched with large amounts of Cd, and the toxicity of Cd inhibited the rapid growth of A. philoxeroides and induced the rapid degradation of chlorophylls in its tissues. Furthermore, the use of iron plaque effectively immobilized Cd of 1123-2883 mg/kg.DW on the root surface, thus it decreased the transferability of Cd in the aquatic environment. Due to its extensive adaptability, good Cd tolerance and the immobilization of Cd predominantly in the roots (the highest Cd concentration enriched was 7588.65 +/- 628.90 mg/kg.DW in roots). A. philoxeroides effectively restrained the translocation of Cd and partitioned Cd in the roots within water bodies.
   Capsule: The antagonistic effect exists between the invasion of A. philoxeroides and cadmium mobility in aquatic environments.

AB Geomembranes (GMs) are widely used in hydraulic applications. Unfortunately, some additives contained in GMs are extracted upon prolonged contact with water or soil. Depending on their chemical nature, additives contained within GMs or degradation products thereof may affect natural ecosystems. To better understand this effect, the present study evaluates the potential impact of additives extracted from GMs that are commonly used in hydraulic applications. The approach consists of identifying additives contained in both unaged and aged high-density polyethylene and polypropylene GMs. Next, these GMs are immersed for various time intervals at 80, 55, and 25 degrees C in aqueous solutions (pH 4 and 7), and the chemical composition of the resulting solution is analyzed by ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy. In addition, the effect of these solutions containing the GM extracts on the growth of Chlorella vulgaris and on the swimming of Daphnia sp. is studied. The first few days of exposure to the extracted molecules negatively impact C. vulgaris growth and Daphnia sp. swimming behavior. However, after prolonged exposure, the impact is reversed and microalgae growth is stimulated instead. This result may be related to the change of the nature of the molecules detected by UV spectroscopy.

AB This paper reports a novel and sensitive homogeneous immunoassay for rapid detection of imidacloprid residue in environmental and food samples. The assay signal was originated from inner filter effect (IFE) between up conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). UCNPs (energy donor) were coupled to the antibody against imidacloprid, and AuNPs (energy acceptor) were used to label the antigen of imidacloprid. The competitive immunoreaction occurred between imidacloprid and antigen-AuNPs binding to antibody-UCNPs. The assay system, sensitivity, selectivity, accuracy, and reliability were investigated. Under the optimal assay condition, the limit of detection for imidacloprid was 0.79 ng/mL and the concentration recovering 50% saturation of the signal (SC50) was 18.7 ng/mL. The linear detection range (SC10 to SC90) was 1.39-335.81 ng/mL. Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully applied to determine imidacloprid in spiked water, Chinese cabbage, and honey samples, giving recoveries in the range of 78.1-97.9%. Through the blind sample tests, the IFE-based immunoassay demonstrated good correlation with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (R-2 = 0.9866). Therefore, the new one-step immunoassay can be used as a promising tool for rapid detection of imidacloprid in field of environment and food safety.

AB Harmful cyanobacterial blooms have been observed in various water bodies all over the world and their secondary metabolite, microcystins (MCs), have threatened aquatic organisms and human health. Meanwhile, iron is one of the key nutrients for algal growth due to its important role in many physiological functions. In our study, different iron regimes were set to investigate their effects on physiological indices and gene expressions of MC biosynthesis in toxic Microcystis aeruginosa. The results showed that iron addition promoted algal growth and chlorophyll-a (CM-a) production. Photosynthetic capacity was inhibited under iron limitation, which blocked the electron transport chain, intensified the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and further damaged algal antioxidant defensive system in cells. Moreover, unsynchronized changes of microcystin-leucine-arginine (MC-LR) level and mcy gene expressions were observed in all iron regimes. Interestingly, despite that the intracellular quantity of MC-LR under iron limitation was less than that under iron-replete condition, the potential toxicity was greater in the former. Iron variation had little influence on the excretion of the toxin, which can be further confirmed by scanning electron microscopic observations. In consequence, we propose an indirect influence of iron on MC biosynthesis that starts with the decreased photosynthetic capacity and energy production by iron limitation, followed by the damaged electron transport in cells, and eventually causes the variation of mcy gene expressions due to energy shortage. Therefore, our study has provided the evidences for the close relationship between iron variation and MC biosynthesis in M. aeruginosa, suggesting that iron should be taken into account during the monitoring of harmful algal blooms in the future.

AB When aromatic hydrocarbons are present in contaminated soils, they often occur in mixtures. The impact of four different (3-ring) nitrogen-containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (N-PAHs) on C-12/14-phenanthrene and C-12/14-benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) mineralisation in soil was investigated over a 90 d incubation period. The results revealed that both C-12/14-phenanthrene and C-12/14-benzo[a]pyrene showed no significant mineralisation in soils amended with 10 mg kg(-1) and 100 mg kg(-1) N-PAHs (p > 0.05). However, increases in lag-phases and decreases in the rates and extents of mineralisation were observed, over time. Among the N-PAHs, benzo [h] quinoline impacted C-14-phenanthrene mineralisation with extended and diauxic lag phases. Furthermore,C-12/14-B[a]P and C-14-benzo[a]pyrene-nitrogen-containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (C-14-B[a]P-N-PAHs) amended soils showed extensive lag phases ( > 21 d); with some C-14-B [a]P-N-PAH mineralisation recording < 1% in both concentrations (10 mg kg(-1) and 100 mg kg(-1)), over time. This study suggests that the presence of N-PAHs in contaminated soil may impact the microbial degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the impact was most likely the result of limited success in achieving absolute biodegradation of some PAHs in soil.

AB The aim of this study is to determine in detail the genotoxic effects of Olive Oil Wastewater (OOWW) on sunflower. For this reason, different concentrations of OOWW (1/1,1/10,1/100) were applied as irrigation water to sunflowers at different times (3-day, 5-day, 10-day). In the plants taken during these times, RAPD-based genomic template stability (GTS) assays and gene expression (transcriptomic) levels of different free radical scavenging enzyme genes (SOD, CAT, SOD2, GST, GPX, APX), protein repair/chaperoning genes (HSP26, HSP70, HSP83), N metabolism gene (GS) and apoptotic genes (BAX, BCL2, BCLXL, CYT-C, XIAP) were compared to the those of the control (OOWW-free) group. As a result; The GTS rates seemed to be fairly lower than the control and therefore the OOWW was likely to cause significant damage to the DNA's nucleotide and genomic structure, and the GTS value increased inversely proportional when the OOWW concentration was reduced from 1/1 to 1/10, and after a 10-day application, it seemed to be partly healing. In transcriptomic analysis; all OOWW experiments caused a free radical threat, and especially in 5-day OOWW applications, this raised significantly almost all expressions of antioxidants, protein repair, N metabolism, and apoptotic genes. So, the damages of 5-day OOWW treatments were found to be relatively more than those of 3-day treatments. Regarding 10-day transcriptomic data; a partial repair was found. Additionally, it was determined that the values of B, F, Al, Mn, Ni, Cr, As, Se, Cd, Pb and total polyphenols were high in OOWW. Our findings were also supported by plant images and various heavy metals' and OOWW polyphenols' toxicity results. Our results pointed to key findings in OOWW genotoxicology.

AB The occurrence, fate, mass loading and environmental emission of 37 pharmaceuticals were studied through an integrated approach involving both dissolved and adsorbed phase at a typical wastewater treatment plant in Hunan Province, Southern China. The results displayed the prevalence of 24 and 23 compounds in dissolved phase of influent and effluent, respectively. Fourteen compounds were found adsorbed onto sludge with a mean concentration ranging from 0.85 to 2900 mu g/kg dry weight. Twelve compounds exhibited high adsorption potential onto suspended particulate matter (SPM) with a mean fraction ranging from 8.8% (trimethoprim) to 97% (tetracycline). Furthermore, SPM showed a diverse absorbability in influent and effluent water circumstance. The overall elimination varied from -16% for lincomycin to 99% for paracetamol, while macrolides were able to withstand the whole treatment process. Mass balance analysis indicated that degradation was the predominant removal pathway for most compounds, and adsorption onto sludge combined with a minor portion of degradation explained for the reduction of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, whereas macrolides were recalcitrant to both two processes. The total mass loading was estimated to be up to 2800 mg/d/1000 inhabitants and most compounds exhibited lower or comparable level comparing to the global published data. The total environmental emission was estimated up to be 1000 mg/d/1000 inhabitants, and a value of 650 mg/d/1000 inhabitants was obtained when considering merely the dissolved phase. This work would be helpful for the better understanding of ultimate fate and real pollution of pharmaceuticals in the water environment.

AB The combined effects of different salinity and temperature levels on the toxicity of Arsenic (As) were studied on the embryonic development of the oyster Crassostrea gigas. A standardized embryotoxicity test was performed to assess the interactive effects of these stressors, in a full factorial design experiment including a range of salinities (15, 19, 24, 28 and 32), temperatures (16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 degrees C) and As concentrations (100, 300, 600, 1200, 2400 mu g L-1). The embryotoxicity endpoint was about the determination of normal larvae development rates at various conditions, and median effect concentration (EC50) determination for each As exposure condition. Results showed that toxicity induced by As was characterized by retardation of embryonic development observing toxic effects at lower concentrations than previously reported studies. The presence of As in seawater resulted in a narrower range of tolerance to both salinity and temperature. These findings bring new insights on the impacts of a common contaminant on an important shellfish species having a planktonic early life stage development, with potential implications for population survival and ecosystem functioning in a changing environment.

AB Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) have the potential to alter fish reproduction at various levels of organization. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a natural environment with heavily anthropogenic influence on the physiological processes involved in reproduction in the freshwater fish lambari (Astyanax fasciatus) using different biomarkers. Adult males and females were collected in different seasons from two distinct sites in the same watershed: Ponte Nova Reservoir (PN) considered a pristine or small anthropogenic influence reference point; and Billings Reservoir (Bil), subjected to a large anthropogenic impact. Biological indices, such as hepatosomatic index and gonadosomatic index (GSI), gonadal histomorphology, fecundity, and biomarkers such as plasma levels of estradiol (E2) as well as hepatic gene expression of its alfa nuclear receptor (ER alpha), were analyzed. Hepatic vitellogenin (VTG) gene expression was evaluated in both sexes, as an indicator of xenoestrogen exposure. Females collected at PN presented a typical annual variation reflected in GSI, whereas for those sampled at Bil the index did not change through the seasons. The higher concentration of E2 in males collected at Bil during spring/2013, together with the detection of VTG gene expression, suggest the presence of EDCs in the water. These EDCs may have also influenced fecundity of females from Bil, which was higher during winter and spring/2013. Gene expression of ERa and ovarian morphology did not differ between fish from both sites. Water conditions from Bil reservoir impacted by anthropic activity clearly interfered mainly with biomarkers of biological effect such as plasma E2 levels and absolute and relative fecundity, but also altered biomarkers of exposure as VTG gene expression. These facts support the notion that waterborne EDCs are capable of causing estrogenic activity in A. fasciatus.

AB A previously undescribed atrazine-degrading bacterial strain TT3 capable of growing with atrazine as its sole nitrogen source was isolated from soil at the wastewater outfall of a pesticide factory in China. Phenotypic characterization and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that the isolate belonged to the genus Citricoccus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed that TT3 contained the atrazine-degrading genes trzN, atzB, and atzC. The range for growth and atrazine degradation of TT3 was found to be pH 6.0-11.0, with a preference for alkaline conditions. At 30 degrees C and pH 7.0, the strain removed 50 mg/L atrazine in 66 h with 1% inoculum. These results demonstrate that Citricoccus sp. TT3 has great potential for bioremediation of atrazine-contaminated sites, particularly in alkaline environments. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports of Citricoccus strains that degrade atrazine, and therefore this work provides a novel candidate for atrazine bioremediation.

AB Phenylurea herbicides are persistent contaminants, which leads their transport to the surface and ground waters, affecting human and aquatic organisms. Different analytical methods have been reported for the detection of phenylureas; however, several of them are expensive, time-consuming, and require complex pretreatment steps. Here, we show a simple method for the simultaneous electrochemical determination of two phenylurea herbicides by differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetry (DPAdSV) using a modified platinum/chitosan electrode. The one-step synthesized platinum/chitosan PtNPs/CS was successfully characterized by TEM, XRPD, and FT-IR, and applied through the sensing platform designated as PtNPs/CS/GCE. This bio-based modified electrode is proposed for the first time for the individual and/or simultaneous electrochemical detection of the phenylurea herbicides diuron and isoproturon compounds extensively used worldwide that present a very similar chemical structure. Electrochemical and interfacial characteristics of the modified electrode were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). It was found that the oxidation mechanism of diuron and isoproturon occurs in two different pathways, with a peak-to-peak definition of ca. 0.15 V. Under differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetry (DPAdSV) optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) was estimated as 7 mu g L-1 for isoproturon and 20 mu g L-1 for diumn (E-d = +0.8 V; t(d) = 100 s). The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of both analytes in river water samples, at three different levels, with a recovery range of 90-110%. The employment of the bio-based sensing platform PtNPs/CS/GCE allows a novel and easy analytical method to the multi-component phenylurea herbicides detection.

AB Cadmium is a highly toxic metal threatening human and animal health. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) was reported to play a positive role in disease treatment and immune regulation. The present study aimed to explore the effect of NAC administration on Cd-induced cytotoxicity and abnormal immune response on chicken peritoneal macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from Isa Brown male chickens were exposed to CdCl2 (20 or 50 mu M) and/or NAC (500 mu M) for different time periods. Results showed that Cd caused dose-dependent damage on chicken peritoneal macrophages characterized by morphologic and ultrastructural alterations, increased cell apoptosis, reactive oxygen species accumulation and mitochondrial injury. Cd exposure inhibited phagocytic activity of chicken peritoneal macrophages, and promoted transcriptional status of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) in both unactivated macrophages and cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimuli. Pretreatment with 500 mu M NAC did not affect growth of normal chicken peritoneal macrophages, while remarkably inhibiting Cd-caused cell death, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. NAC pretreatment significantly prevented intracellular Cd2+ accumulation in the Cd-exposed macrophages. Inhibitory effects of NAC on Cd-induced ROS accumulation and mitochondrial injury on chicken macrophages were confirmed in HD-11 macrophage cell line. In addition, NAC pretreatment promoted the phagocytic activity of Cdexposed chicken peritoneal macrophages, and significantly inhibited expression of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) in both Cd-exposed macrophages and Cd-treated cells in response to LPS stimuli. In conclusion, the present study firstly demonstrated the antagonistic effect of NAC against Cd-caused damage and abnormal immune response on chicken peritoneal macrophages. Protective effect of NAC on chicken macrophages was highly related to its suppression on Cd-induced ROS overproduction, pro-inflammatory reaction and intracellular Cd2+ accumulation.

AB Although the toxicity of triclocarban at molecular level has been investigated, the metabolic networks involved in regulating the stress processes are not clear. Whether the cells would maintain specific phenotypic characteristics after triclocarban stress is also needed to be clarified. In this study, Escherichia coli was selected as a model to elucidate the cellular metabolism response associated with triclocarban stress and the recovery metabolic network of the triclocarban-treated cells using the proteomics and metabolomics approaches. Results showed that triclocarban caused systematic metabolic remodeling. The adaptive pathways, glyoxylate shunt and acetate-switch were activated. These arrangements allowed cells to use more acetyl-CoA and to reduce carbon atom loss. The upregulation of NH3-dependent NAD(+) synthetase complemented the NAD(+) consumption by catabolism, maintaining the redox balance. The synthesis of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate was suppressed, which would affect the accumulation of end products of its downstream pathway of isoprenoid synthesis. After recovery culture for 12 h, the state of cells returned to stability and the main impacts on metabolic network triggered by triclocarban have disappeared. However, drug resistance caused by long-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentration of triclocarban is still worthy of attention. The present study revealed the molecular events under triclocarban stress and clarified how triclocarban influence the metabolic networks.

AB Following oil extraction in the wetland of the Yellow River Delta, heavy metal contamination of coastal saline-alkaline soil, especially with cadmium (Cd), has become a serious environmental problem in some regions. Biochar application has been proposed to remedy Cd-contaminated soil, but the remediation effect is related to preparation conditions of biochar (e.g., pyrolysis temperature and raw material) and soil properties. The invasive plant, Spartina alterniflora, produces a high amount of biomass, making it suitable for biochar production in coastal China. We investigated the effect of S. alterniflora-derived biochar (SDB) pyrolyzed at four temperatures (350, 450, 550, and 650 degrees C) crossed with three addition ratios (1, 5, and 10%) and control on Cd contamination of coastal saline-alkaline soil. Pyrolysis temperature affected pH, surface area, and functional groups of SDB. SDB markedly improved soil pH and soil organic matter, but the degree of improvement was affected by pyrolysis temperature and addition ratio. SDB significantly altered available Cd content in soil, but reduced it only at low pyrolysis temperatures (350 and 450 degrees C). Available Cd content had a positive correlation with soil pH (R-2 = 0.298, P < 0.01), but was not related to salinity and soil organic matter content. Thus, SDB pyrolyzed at 350 degrees C with 5% addition was optimal for passivating Cd in coastal saline-alkaline soil, since available Cd content in soil decreased mostly (by 26.9%). These findings act as a reference for the development of an application strategy for SDB to ameliorate Cd-contaminated coastal saline-alkaline soil.

AB The interaction between multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and soil heavy metals was rarely studied. With the convenience of detecting multiple metal elements by ICP-AES, this paper examined the potential effectiveness of MWCNTs on extractability of antimony (Sb) and cadmium (Cd) in contaminated soil. Three-step sequential extraction procedure, toxicity characteristic leaching procedure, bioaccessibility and CaCl2 single extraction were employed to evaluate Sb and Cd speciations and their extractabilities. According to our results, only at low Sb content level of 100 mg/kg, antimony bioavailability reduced with MWCNTs addition of 0.3% and 0.9% by 22.97% and 20.74%, respectively, which might due to the increase of adsorption point, nevertheless, the excess Sb(OH)(6) was not adsorbed more efficiently. Secondly, due to the difference in effective specific surface area, only under the condition of high content level and MWCNTs addition of 0.1%, the mild acid-soluble fraction increased at most by 15.40% for Sb and 9.40% for Cd, respectively. However, in terms of TCLPextractable Sb and Cd and CaCl2-extractable Sb and Cd, no significant, continuous, regular extractability pattern were found. Overall, MWCNTs were selective on extractability of soil heavy metals due to mechanisms of physical adsorption. This paper provides data reference for the interaction between MWCNTs and soil heavy metals extractability.

AB The widespread existence of microplastics in wastewater has caused great concern. As the exposure time of microplastics in the environment increases, the microplastic leaching solution (i.e.,chemical additives) may be released into the environment causing toxic effects. In this study, the effect of polystyrene (PS) microplastics on the anaerobic digestion system was investigated. The results showed that the exposure to 80 nm and 5 mu m polystyrene microplastics with the concentrations of 0.2 g/L or lower did not significantly affect the cumulative methane production (P >= 0.05). On the other hand, 80 nm and 5 mu m PS microplastic level of 0.25 g/L led to a decrease in methane production by 19.3% (P = 2 x 10(-5)) and 17.9% (P = 4 x 10(-5)), respectively. The 80 nm PS nanoplastics therefore had slightly higher inhibition capacity on methane production than 5 um PS microplastics. The pH of all groups remained stable at 6.7-7.5. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) concentration and ammonium-nitrogen concentration had no obvious relationship to PS micro and nanoplastics addition. Further investigation showed that PS micro and nanoplastics concentration of 0.25 g/L or higher could inhibit acidification and methanation stage of anaerobic digestion. However, the main negative influence of PS micro and nanoplastics on methane production was due to the severe inhibition on the methanization stage.

AB Taste and odor (T&O) problem in water is one of the main obstacles to improve the quality of drinking water, and efficient water treatment processes are urgently needed to control T&O compounds. Ultraviolet-mediated peroxymonosulfate (UV/PMS) diminution of trichloroanisole (TCA) in water was investigated in this paper. The treatment of 2,3,6-trichloroanisole (2,3,6-TCA) by three advanced oxidation processes (UV, UV/H2O2 and UV/PMS) was compared, and UV/PMS stood out. SO4 center dot- and HO center dot were produced in the UV/PMS, and their specific contributions to 2,3,6-TCA oxidation were investigated. The competitive kinetic model was applied to determine the second-order reaction rate between 2,3,6-TCA and SO4 center dot- or HO center dot. The products of 2,3,6-TCA generated in UV/PMS were analyzed with gas chromatography/high resolution-mass spectrometry (GC/HR-MS), and the degradation mechanism was proposed. The effects of water matrices (chloride, bicarbonate and humic acid) on UV/PMS performance were studied, and the decontamination of 2,3,6-TCA in real water was carried out. The disinfection byproducts (DBPs) alteration from 2,3,6-TCA by UV/PMS - chlorination treatment was explored. Overall, UV/PMS can effectively deal with the T&O pollution of TCA in water.

AB Cyanobacteria blooms are crucial environmental issues by threatening both aquatic ecosystem and human health. A biomass by-product with antimicrobial activity, pyroligneous acid (PA) was tested for its suitability for removal of the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) in this work. Results show that the removal efficiency could reach up to 90% in the presence of 0.45% of PA and the inhibition to M. aeruginosa growth could extend to at least 40 days. The removal mechanism was studied. Both organic acids and phenols are functional content in M. aeruginosa removal and acetic acid is the most important one. Zeta potential analysis and morphology study show that the damage of cells dominates the flocculation and sedimentation of M. aeruginosa under low PA concentration (<0.7%), and increasing PA (>= 0.7%) resulted in a trend of zeta potential to zero, thus removing any "shield" and triggering flocculation. Finally, study on the phenols residual after M. aeruginosa treatment shows that it could be close to 0 in 70 h. Therefore, this work proposes a possible method for worldwide treatment of cyanobacteria bloom and a new way for further utilization of PA.

AB Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used as antimicrobial agents and resulted in their accumulation in environment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying AgNP-induced lung cellular senescence which has been proposed as a pathogenic driver of chronic lung disease. Herein, we demonstrate that exposure to AgNPs elevates multiple senescence biomarkers in lung cells, with cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, and potently activates genes of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in human fetal lung fibroblast cell line MRCS. Fluorescence-based assay also reveals that apoptosis induced by AgNPs is associated with senescence. Furthermore, we show that AgNPs cause premature senescence through an increase in transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) expression and overproduction of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in lung cells. Inhibition of COX2 reduces AgNPs-induced senescence to a normal level. Moreover, AgNPs also induce upregulation of COX2 and accelerate lung cellular senescence in vivo and cause mild fibrosis in the lung tissue of mice. Taken together, our studies support a critical role of AgNPs in the induction of lung cellular senescence via the upregulation of the COX2/PGE2 intracrine pathway, and suggest the adverse effects to the human respiratory system.

AB Skeletal fluomsis causes growth plate impairment and growth retardation during bone development. However, the mechanism of how fluoride impairs chondrocyte is unclear. To explore the effect of fluoride on chondmcyte differentiation and the regulation of circadian clock signaling pathway during chondrogenesis, we treated ATDC5 cells with fluoride and carried out a series of experiments. 10(-3) M fluoride inhibited cell viability and significantly decreased the expression of Sox9 and Col2a1 (P < 0.05). Fluoride inhibited proteoglycan synthesis and decreased significantly the expression of Aggrecan, Ihh and Col10a1 (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, fluoride significantly inhibited the expression of Bmall and disrupted circadian clock signaling pathway (P < 0.05). Furthermore, fluoride disrupted the time-dependent expression of circadian clock molecules and stage-specific differentiation markers. Overexpression of Bmal1 by lentivirus reversed the adverse effects of fluoride on chondrogenesis. These results suggested that fluoride inhibited chondrocyte viability and delayed chondmcyte differentiation. Fluoride delayed chondrogenesis partly via interfering with Bmal1 and circadian clock signaling pathway. Nevertheless, the specific mechanism of circadian clock in fluoride-induced cartilage damage needs to be further studied.

AB The hepatopancreas is the digestive organ of crustaceans, and plays important roles also in the synthesis and secretion of sexual hormones, immunological defenses and xenobiotic detoxification. Although the importance of this organ in crustaceans cannot be underestimated, the effects of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation on hepatopancreas are poorly understood. Moreover, Macrobrachium prawns, have a transparent carapace, which make them more susceptible to UVB radiation, since their internal organs, such as hepatopancreas, are easily reached by solar radiation. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate UVB radiation toxicity on the morphology and morphometry of hepatopancreatic epithelial cells, and to investigate these UVB effects in subcellular compartments of the ecologically-important freshwater decapod, Macrobrachium olfersii. Hepatopancreas from the UVB-irradiated group showed a granular cytoplasm, with non-defined cell limits. Morphometric analyses revealed that the UVB-irradiated group exhibited a higher frequency of fibrillar (F-cell), resorptive (R-cell) and midget (M-cell), and decreased the blister-like (B-cell). It was also observed increased vacuole frequencies and increased F-, B- and R-cell volumes in the UVB-irradiated group. In addition, it was observed increased B-cell vacuolar volumes and decreased R-cell vacuolar volumes. Ultrastructural alterations occurred in subcellular compartments in F- and R-cells, e.g. loss of mitochondrial crests, morphologically compatible with mitochondrial fission, rough endoplasmic reticulum cisternae dilation, dilation of Golgi lamellar sacs, and increased vacuole and concentric membrane formation in the UVB-irradiated group. Our data showed that the hepatopancreas is an important target of UVB radiation, as demonstrated by a series of organ-specific morphological and morphometric impairments. Therefore, cell damage caused by UVB radiation can compromise metabolic functions in epithelial cells from the hepatopancreas, potentially affecting absorption, secretion and digestion processes, vitellogenin synthesis, immune responses and xenobiotic detoxification.

AB To evaluate the aquatic hazards of the insect juvenile hormone analogue fenoxycarb, a single application (0, 48.8, 156.3, 500, 1600, and 5120 mu g/L) of it was done in indoor freshwater systems dominated by Daphnia carinata (daphnid) and Dolerocypris sinensis (ostracoda). The responses of zooplankton (counted by abundance and the activity and immuno-reactive content of free N-Acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase)), phytoplankton (counted by chlorophyll and phycocyanin), planktonic bacteria and fungi, and some water quality parameters were investigated in a period of 35 d. Results of the study showed that the ostracoda was more sensitive than daphnid, with time-weighted average (TWA)-based no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) to be 8.45 and 12.66 mu g/L in systems without humic acid addition (HA-) and to be 6.37 and 9.54 mu g/L in systems with humic acid addition (HA+). The duration of treatment-related effects in the ostracoda population was longer than the daphnid population (21 vs. 14 days). Besides, the data analysis indicated that the toxicity of fenoxycarb was significantly enhanced in the HA+ systems. Owing to the reduced grazing pressure, the concentrations of chlorophyll and phycocyanin increased in the two highest treatments. The increase in photosynthesis along with a reduced animal excretion led to an increase in pH and a decrease in nutrient contents. These changes seemed to have an effect on the microbial communities. For example, the abundances of some opportunistic pathogens of aquatic animals (e.g. Aeromonas and Cladosporium) and organic-pollutant-degrading microorganisms (e.g. Ancylobacter and Azospirillum) increased significantly in microbial communities, but the abundances of Pedobacter, Candidatus Planktoluna, and Rhodobacter (photosynthetic bacteria) markedly decreased. This study provides useful information to understand the ecotoxicological impacts of fenoxycarb at the population and community levels while integrating the effects of HA on toxicity.

AB Liver is the earliest target for AFB1 toxicity in both human and animals. In the last decade, plant derived by-products have been used in animal feed to reduce AFB1 induced toxicity. In the present study we investigated whether the presence of 8% grape seed meal by-product is able to counteract the hepatotoxic effects produced by AFB1 in liver of pig after weaning exposed to the toxin through the contaminated feed for 28 days.
   Twenty four weaned cross-bred TOPIGS-40 piglets with an average body weight of 9.13 +/- 0.03 were allocated to the following experimentally treatments: control diet without AFB1 (normal compound feed for weaned pigs); contaminated diet with 320 mg kg(-1) AFB1; GSM diet (compound feed plus 8% grape seed meal) and AFB1+GSM diet (320 mg kg(-1) AFB1 contaminated feed plus 8% grape seed meal).
   Pigs fed AFB1 diet had altered performance, body weight decreasing with 25.1% (b.w.: 17.17 kg for AFB1 vs 22.92 kg for control). Exposure of piglets to AFB1 contaminated diet caused liver oxidative stress as well as liver histological damage, manly characterized by inflammatory infiltrate, fibrosis and parenchyma cells vacuolation when compared to control and GSM meal group. 94.12% of the total analysed genes (34) related to inflammation and immune response was up-regulated. The addition of GSM into the AFB1 diet diminished the gene overexpression and ameliorate histological liver injuries and oxidative stress. The protective effect of GSM diet in diminishing the AFB1 harmful effect was mediated through the decreasing of gene and protein expression of MAPKs and NF-.B signalling overexpressed by AFB1 diet. The inclusion of grape seed by-products in the diet of pigs after weaning might be used as a novel nutritional intervention to reduce aflatoxin toxicity.

DE Ryegrass; Cd tolerance; Cd influx and Cd accumulation; Cd transport
   regulatory genes
AB Cadmium (Cd), which seriously affects plant growth and crop production, is harmful to humans. Previous studies revealed ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) exhibits Cd tolerance, and may be useful as a potential hyper-accumulator because of its wide distribution. In this study, the physiological and transcriptional responses of two ryegrass cultivars [i.e., high (LmHC) and low (LmLC) Cd tolerance] to Cd stress were investigated and compared. The Cd tolerance of LmHC was greater than that of LmLC at various Cd concentrations. The uptake of Evans blue dye revealed that Cd-induced root cell mortality was higher in LmLC than in LmHC after a 12-h Cd treatment. Furthermore, the content and influx rate of Cd in LmLC roots were greater than in LmHC roots under Cd stress conditions. The RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR data indicated that the Cd transport regulatory genes (ABCG37, ABCB4, NRAMP4, and HMA5) were differentially expressed between the LmLC and LmHC roots. This expression-level diversity may contribute to the differences in the Cd accumulation and translocation between LmLC and LmHC. These findings may help clarify the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying ryegrass responses to Cd toxicity. Additionally, ryegrass may be able to hyperaccumulate toxic heavy metals during the phytoremediation of contaminated soil.

AB Total dissolved gas (TDG) supersaturation generated by discharged flood water may cause the death of fish downstream of dams and severely threaten their survival during the flood season. No study has performed to investigate the effects of TDG on fish dwelling in shallows in China. Furthermore, varied TDG levels are caused by the varied flow of flood water during the spill season. Fish may alternatingly experience intermittent TDG exposure from equilibrated water and TDG-supersaturated water. However, little research on the effects of intermittent TDG exposure on fish has been conducted. To evaluate the tolerance of fish to continuous acute TDG exposure, juvenile yellow catfish living in the shallows were exposed to TDG-supersaturated water at 125%, 130%, 135% and 140% TDG for 96 h. The results showed that the juvenile yellow catfish exhibited obvious gas bubble disease (GBD) and abnormal behaviours (e.g., exophthalmos and bubbles on fins). The survival probability declined with the arising TDG levels. The median survival time (ST50) of yellow catfish was 8.57, 18.1, 33.86 and 58.84 h at above TDG levels, respectively. To further investigate the effects of intermittent TDG exposure on juvenile yellow catfish, the fish were subjected to varied TDG levels (125%, 130%, 135% and 140%) for a specific duration (3 h and 6 h) and then underwent a period of recovery (3, 6 and 9 h) in equilibrated water. The results showed that an increase in recovery time (or decreasing exposure time) can prolong the survival time of yellow catfish and improve their survival probability at the same exposure time (or same recovery time). Compared with that under continuous acute exposure, the ST50 of juvenile yellow catfish increased significantly with intermittent exposure. Intermittent exposure can enhance the tolerance of juvenile yellow catfish to TDG. The application of the results may contribute to the protection of aquatic organisms and the formulation of the scheme of reservoir operation in the Yangtze River.

AB Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most important pathogens related to hospital-acquired infections. The incidence of infections by hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp), especially community-acquired infections, has been increasing in recent decades. The occurrence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) hvKp has been increasingly reported worldwide decreasing the treatment options, which is a concern. Aquatic environments have been considered a reservoir of MDR pathogens, which contribute to the spread of MDR pathogens. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize MDR-hvKp strains obtained from public aquatic environments using whole genome sequencing in Brazil. Resistome analysis showed ARGs to beta-lactams, quinolones, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, and fosfomycin as well as several metal resistance genes. Virulome analysis showed several virulence genes. Besides, genomic islands, CRISPR and prophage-related sequences were also detected. MLST analysis revealed the presence of two novel sequences types (STs) belonging to different clonal complexes (CCs) [ST4415 (CC515) and ST4416 (CC2654)], and one already described [ST661 (CC661)]. The presence of MDR-hvKp lineages in water sources belonging to STs and CCs associated with humans and animals shows the ability of these pathogens to spread to different aquatic environments. This study reports for the first time two novel STs of MDR-hvKp as well as the presence of a rare ST661 closely related to outbreaks in aquatic environments, and contributes to surveillance studies and MDR-hvKp monitoring worldwide.

AB Growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis plays a critical role in fetal development. However, the effect of arsenite exposure on the GH/IGF axis and its toxic mechanism are still unclear. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to a range of NaAsO2 concentrations (0.0-10.0 mM) between 4 and 120 h post-fertilization (hpf). Development indexes of survival, malformation, hatching rate, heart rate, body length and locomotor behavior were measured. Hormone levels, GH/IGF axis-related genes, and nerve-related genes were also tested. The results showed that survival rate, hatching rate, heart rate, body length and locomotor behavior all decreased, while deformity increased. At 120 hpf, the survival rate of zebrafish in 1.5 mM NaAsO2 group was about 70%, the deformity rate exceeded 20%, and the body length shortened to 3.35 mm, the movement distance of zebrafish decreased approximately 63.6% under light condition and about 52.4% under dark condition. The level of GH increased and those of IGF did not change significantly, while the expression of GH/IGF axis related genes (ghra, ghrb, igf2r, igfbp3, igfbp2a, igfbp5b) and nerve related genes (dlx2, shha, ngn1, elavl3, gfap) decreased. In 1.5 mM NaAsO2 group, the decrease of igfbp3 and igfbp5b was almost obvious, about 78.2% and 72.2%. The expression of nerve genes in 1.5 mM NaAsO2 group all have declined by more than 50%. These findings suggested that arsenite exerted disruptive effects on the endocrine system by interfering with the GH/IGF axis, leading to zebrafish embryonic developmental toxicity.

AB Chronic dietary bioaccumulation tests with rodents are required for new substances, including engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), in order to provide information on the potential hazards to human health. However, screening tools are needed to manage the diversity of ENMs and alternative methods are desirable with respect to animal welfare. Here, an ex vivo gut sac method was used to estimate the dietary bioaccumulation potential of silver nanomaterials. The entire gastrointestinal tract (except the caecum) was removed and filled with a gut saline containing 1 mg L-1 of Ag as either AgNO3, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) or silver sulphide nanoparticles (Ag2S NPs), and compared to controls with no added Ag. The gut sacs were incubated for 4 h, rinsed to remove excess media, and the total Ag determined in the mucosa and muscularis. There was no detected Ag in the control treatments. Within the Ag treatments, 1.4-22% of the exposure dose was associated with the tissues and serosal saline. Within the mucosa of the AgNO3 treatment, the highest Ag concentration was associated with the intestinal regions (3639-7087 ng g(-1)) compared to the stomach (639 +/- 128 ng g(-1)). This pattern was also observed in the Ag NP and Ag2S NP treatments, but there was no significant differences between any Ag treatments for the mucosa. However, differences between treatments were observed in the muscularis concentration. For example, both the Ag NP (907 +/- 284 ng g(-1)) and Ag2S NP (1482 +/- 668 ng g(-1)) treatments were significantly lower compared to the AgNO3 treatment (2514 +/- 267 ng g(-1)). The duodenum demonstrated serosal accumulation in both the AgNO3 (similar to 10 ng mL(-1)) and Ag NP (similar to 3 ng mL(-1)) treatments. The duodenum showed some of the highest Ag accumulation with 41, 61 and 57% of the total Ag in the mucosa compared to the muscularis for the AgNO3, Ag NP and Ag2S NP treatments, respectively. In conclusion, the ex vivo gut sac method demonstrates the uptake of Ag in all Ag treatments, with the duodenum the site of highest accumulation. Based on the serosal saline accumulation, the ranked order of accumulation is AgNO3 > Ag NPs > Ag2S NPs.

AB Crude oil contamination in soils may result in destructive effects on soil microorganisms and plants and act as a source of groundwater contamination. The objective of this study was to evaluate the biological activities for a better understanding of ecological risks. A couple of biological assays, including soil microbial biomass of carbon (SMBC) and urease activity (UA), were used to evaluate the microbial activities in soils. The chemical analysis demonstrated different values of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) concentrations (from 0.12 to 2.99 mg/kg of dry soil) and relatively high quantities of Nickel (from 32 to 136.8 mg/kg of dry soil) and cadmium (from 0 to 4 mg/kg of dry soil) in samples. UA and SMBC values were comparatively lower in close distances to oil wells, pipelines, and especially drilling sediments pool. The spatial variability maps using the interpolation module by GIS specified the line from northwest to the southeast of the area as a more affected area by TPHs and Ni + Cd.

AB There is much interest in converting natural nanoclay into modified forms for a variety of applications. Aquatic organisms have been exposed to natural nanoclay throughout their entire evolutionary history, but concerns have been raised about the effects of modified nanoclay on aquatic organisms. We investigated the potential toxicity of a natural nanoclay (Na+ montmorillonite) and two modified nanoclays (Cloisite (R) 30B and Novaclay (TM)) on survivorship and body growth of Daphnia magna and Chironomus dilutus. Natural nanoclay had no harmful effect on C. dilutus but reduced the survival (similar to 1mgL(-1)) and body growth (similar to 100 mgL(-1)) of D. magna. Novaclay (TM) had no harmful effects on C. dilutus or the body growth of D. magna but an intermediate concentration (1 mgL-1) caused a stronger reduction in D. magna survival during chronic exposure than did natural nanoclay. Cloisite (R) 30B adversely affected D. magna survival at concentrations as low as 0.01 mgL(-1) and nearly all D. magna died when exposed to concentrations of Cloisite (R) 30B that exceeded 10 mgL(-1) during acute exposure and 1 mgL(-1) during chronic exposure. Though Cloisite (R) 30B appeared to have no effect on the body growth of surviving D. magna, Cloisite (R) 30B reduced C. dilutus body growth (100 mgL(-1)). Cloisite (R) 30B likely has higher toxic effects due to the presence of quaternary ammonium compounds and/or particle stability. Our work demonstrates that natural nanoclay has harmful effects on aquatic animals and that the different ways of converting natural nanoclay into different types of modified nanoclays augments the toxic effect of nanoclay to differing degrees.

AB Sperm morphology and performance traits are key determinants of male fertilization success, particularly when females copulate with multiple males. Such sperm traits have been reported to be influenced by environmental pollutants in various animals; however, such studies remain rare in free-living birds exposed to heavy metal pollution. In the present study, we selected tree sparrow (Passer montanus) as the study object to explore the effect of long-term environmental heavy metal pollution on sperm morphology (assessed mainly by using the dimensions of different sperm components and the sperm abnormality rates) and sperm performance (indicated by sperm velocity), and to elucidate potential relationships between variations in sperm morphology and performance. Sperm ATP concentration was also assessed considering sperm morphology and performance could be linked via energy availability. According to our results, tree sparrows from heavy metal polluted area (1) accumulated cadmium at a higher level in their testes; (2) produced longer sperm with lower abnormality rates, in addition to sperm with longer flagella and smaller head/flagellum ratios; (3) their sperm swam faster compared to those from the relatively unpolluted area, while no differences were observed in sperm ATP concentrations. We also found that the levels of lead and cadmium in testes affected the sperm nucleus length, and the level of copper in testes was negatively related to the proportions of abnormal sperm. Furthermore, the present study showed that sperm velocity was negatively correlated with sperm head lengths, head/flagellum ratios and ATP concentrations. Our study results reveal that sperm morphology and performance in tree sparrows show positive variations to maximize male fertility ability under long-term environmental heavy metal pollution, where males increase sperm flagellum lengths to decrease head/flagellum ratios, as opposed to varying sperm energy production, to achieve higher sperm velocity.

AB The nonlinear associations of serum perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) with hypertension and blood pressure have not been addressed. Cross-sectional data from 6967 adults (age >= 20 years) from the 2003-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed. Hypertension was defined as an average systolic blood pressure above 140 mmHg, an average diastolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg or self-reported use of prescribed medicine for diagnosed hypertension. After multivariable adjustment, compared with the lowest tertile, the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of hypertension for the highest tertile of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) were 1.32 (1.13, 1.54), 1.14 (0.97, 1.34), 1.16 (0.99, 1.36) and 1.18 (1.01, 1.37), respectively. PFOA and PFNA displayed a J-shaped relationship with the prevalence of hypertension. Furthermore, threshold effect analysis showed that the inflection point of PFOA was 1.80 ng/ml. Each 10-fold change in PFOA exhibited a 44% decrease (OR 0.56, 95%CI (0.32, 0.99)) in the odds of hypertension on the left side of the inflection point, and an 85% increase (OR 1.85, 95%CI (1.34, 2.54)) on the right side of the inflection point. Threshold effect analysis also indicated that the inflection point of PFNA was 0.53 ng/ml. Each 10-fold change in PFNA exhibited a 60% decrease (OR 0.40, 95%CI (0.18, 0.85)) in the odds of hypertension on the left side of the inflection point, and an 85% increase (OR 1.64, 95%CI (1.25, 2.14)) on the right side of the inflection point. These cross-sectional data showed a J-shaped association between perfluoroalkyl acids and hypertension.

AB 28-Day sediment-spiked laboratory toxicity tests with eight benthic macroinvertebrates and the lipophilic fungicide fludioxonil were conducted to verify the proposed tiered sediment effect assessment procedure as recommended by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The test species were the oligochaetes Lumbriculus variegatus and Tubifex tubifex, the insects Chironomus riparius and Caenis horaria, the crustaceans Hyalella azteca and Asellus aquaticus and the bivalves Corbicula fluminalis and Pisidium amnicum. Toxicity estimates were expressed in terms of total concentration of dry sediment as well as in pore water concentration. Field-collected sediment, also used in a previously performed sediment-spiked microcosm experiment, was used in tests with all species. L. variegatus and C. riparius had similar lowest 28d-LEC10 values when expressed in terms of total sediment concentration, but in terms of pore water concentration L. variegatus was more sensitive. Three of the six additional benthic test species (A. aquaticus, C. horaria, C. fluminalis) had 28d-EC10, values a factor of 2-6 lower than that of L. variegatus. Comparing different effect assessment tiers for sediment organisms, i.e. Tier-0 (Modified Equilibrium Partitioning approach), Tier-1 (Standard Test Species approach), Tier-2 (Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) approach) and Tier-3 (Model Ecosystem approach), it is concluded that the tiers based on sediment-spiked laboratory toxicity tests provide sufficient protection when compared with the Tier-3 Regulatory Acceptable Concentration (RAC). Differences between Tier-1 and Tier-2 RACs, however, appear to be relatively small and not always consistent, irrespective of expressing the RAC in terms of total sediment or pore water concentration. Derivation of RACs by means of the SSD approach may be a challenge, because it is difficult obtaining a sufficient number of valid chronic EC10, values with appropriate 95% confidence bands for sediment-dwelling macroinvertebrates. Therefore, this paper proposes a Tier-2 Weight-of-Evidence approach to be used in case an insufficient number of valid additional toxicity data is made available. Similar studies with pesticides that differ in fate properties and toxic mode-of-action are necessary for further validation of the tiered effect assessment approach for sediment organisms.

AB Antibiotic residues in the environment pose a great risk to global public health. They increase antibiotic resistance by enhancing plasmid conjugation among bacteria or mutations within bacterial genomes. However, little is known about whether the putative environmental levels of antibiotics are sufficient to influence plasmid-mediated transformability. In this study, we explored the effect of eight kinds of representative antibiotics and several other compounds on the plasmid transformability of competent Escherichia coll. Only levofloxacin (LEV) at the putative environmental levels was found to facilitate the frequency of PBR322-or RP4-plasmid-mediated transformation by up to 5.3-fold. Additionally, PBR322 transformation frequency could be further enhanced by copper ion or ammonia nitrogen but inhibited by humic acid. However, when competent E. coll. was exposed to the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the antibiotics, an enhanced plasmid-assimilation ability was observed and plasmid transformation frequency was increased by up to 98.6-fold for all the tested antibiotics. Furthermore, E. coli exhibited a preference for the uptake of plasmids harbouring the resistance genes to the antibiotics it had been exposed to. Among these antibiotics, cephalexin, tetracycline, and kanamycin induced the highest uptake of RP4. The putative environmental levels of LEV enhanced plasmid transformability regardless of the presence of corresponding antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) on the genetic elements, suggesting environmental LEV residues may facilitate dissemination of antibiotic resistance by any plasmid-mediated transformability, thereby posing a great risk to health.

AB The speciation of heavy metals, besides the total concentrations, urgently need to be considered when assessing the eco-toxicity and the bioavailability of heavy metals in environment. This paper aims to investigate the distribution and chemical speciation (e.g. the acid extractable fraction (F1), the reducible fraction (F2), the oxidizable fraction (F3), and the residual fraction (F4)) of heavy metals during the anaerobic digestion process of swine manure. The majority of six heavy metals from the manure was located in biogas residue in the order of decreasing concentration Zn > Cu > Ni > As > Pb > Cd. The transformation of heavy metals among four fractions was observed during the digestion process, and the change of bioavailable fraction of Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd, As and Pb were 9.71%, -6.04%, -19.24%, 13.62%, - 16.48% and -7.22%, respectively. The heat map of correlation coefficients and the stepwise linear regressions model were established to describe the correlation between the bioavailability of the metals and the given digestion variables to predict the influence of the selected variables on the bioavailability of heavy metals. The variations of heavy metal bioavailable fractions are attributed to three key digestion variables, NH4+-N concentration, CH4% in biogas daily yield and pH. These results provide a new perspective for analysis and control of heavy metals during the anaerobic digestion process.

AB Flagellar motility enables resource acquisition and noxious substance evasion, underpinning imperative ecological processes in aquatic environments. Yet the underlying mechanism that links flagellar motility with surface attachment and thereby biofilm formation, especially in conditions of limited resource availability, remains elusive. Here, we present experimental and modeling evidence to unveil bacterial motility and biofilm formation under nutrient-limited stresses with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (WT) and its nonflagellated isogenic mutant (Delta fiiC) as model bacteria. Results revealed that boosted flagellar motility of WT strain promoted biofilm initialization to a peak value of 0.99 x 10(7) cells/cm(2) at 1/50 dilution after 20 min incubation. We hypothesized that bacteria can invoke instant motility acceleration for survival confronting nutrient-limited stress, accompanied by optimized chemotactic foraging through sensing ambient chemical gradients. Accordingly, accelerated cell motility in oligotrophic environment created increased cell-cell and cell-surface interactions and thereof facilitated biofilm initialization. It was confirmed by the consistence of modeling predictions and experimental results of cell velocity and surface attachment. With the development of biofilm, promotion effect of flagellar motility responding to nutrient deprivation-stress faded out. Instead, loss of motility profiting increased growth rates and extracellular protein excretion, associated with an enhancement of biofilm development for the mutant in oligotrophic aquatic environment. For both strains, nutrient limitation evidently reduced planktonic cell propagation as expected. Our results offer new insights into the mechanical understanding of biofilm formation shaped by environmental stresses and associating biological responses.

AB Vesicles (Ves) within fungal cells are the critical linkage between intracellular and extracellular systems. This study explored the application of Pb2+ to probe the physiology of intracellular Ves in Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (Rho). At low Pb2+ levels (0-500 mg/L), there was no evident change in the content of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) or microbial activity. At medium-high levels (1000-2000 mg/L), the sizes of Ves within the Rho cells were significantly enlarged, with abundant lead nano-particles (Pb NPs) formed either on the cell surface or interior, whereas the EPS content and bioactivity were still stable. At a high level (2500 mg/L), the Rho cells were severely deformed, with cell counts reduced by more than 99%. However, the EPS contents and the respiration rate of the surviving cells dramatically increased to the maximum values (i.e., 1785 mg/10(10) cells and 37 mg C 10(-10) cells h(-1), respectively). The Ves surface adsorbed Pb cations with higher density, compared with the cell membrane. Moreover, fusion of some Ves to the membrane (functioning in transport) was observed under transmission electron microscope (TEM). Three pathways of detoxification via intracellular Ves were finally proposed, i.e., Ve-mediated transport (from intracellular to extracellular) of EPS components, absorption of Pb NPs on the Ve surface, and accumulation of Pb NPs within Ves. This study sheds light on the possibility of exploring microbial physiology via Pb2+ cations.

AB In recent decades, indoor air quality (IAQ) has become one of the most important human health issues. The potential properties and potential health hazards of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are associated with their long-term residues, bioaccumulation and semivolatility, and they can also be transferred through a variety of media, such as the atmosphere, water and soil. Dust particles from indoor and outdoor emission sources adhere to A-C filters and can represent air quality to a certain extent. However, few studies have focused on PAHs in A-C filter dust in Hefei, China. In this study, 16 PAHs were selected, dust samples were collected from A-C filters from three different functional districts, and GC-MS analysis of the samples was performed. The concentration of the Sigma 16PAHs ranged from 7.34 to 326.84 mu g g(-1), 5.07-15.34 mu g g(-1), 4.09-47.26 mu g g(-1) and 0.97-13.38 mu g g(-1) in dust samples from the Administrative District (AD), Industrial District (ID), Commercial District (CD) and Outdoors (OD), respectively. The total PAH concentration in A-C dust was much higher than that in dust deposited outdoors in the urban area. The percentage of 5-6 ring PAHs accounted for more than 70% of the Sigma 16PAHs, which shows that the PAHs in A-C dust mainly come from pyrolysis rather than a diagenetic source. Principal component analysis (PCA) and diagnostic ratios were used in a source analysis, and the results indicated that the main PAHs emission sources in the different functional districts were coal, wood and biomass combustion. The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) values indicated a medium to high potential carcinogenic risk for adults and children exposed to dust with PAHs. Particularly, skin contact and ingestion of carcinogenic PAHs from dust are the major exposure pathways and present an exposure risk that is four to five orders of magnitude higher than the risk of inhalation.

AB Emerging POPs have received increasing attention due to their potential persistence and toxicity, but thus far the report regarding the occurrence and distribution of these POPs in PM2.5 is limited. In this study, an extremely sensitive and reliable method, using ultrasonic solvent extraction and silica gel purification followed by gas chromatography coupled with electron ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, was developed and used for the trace analysis of hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD), pentachloroanisole (PCA) and its analogs chlorobenzenes (CBs) in PM2.5 from Taiyuan within a whole year. The limits of detection and limits of quantitation of analytes were 1.14 x 10(-4)-2.74 x 10(-4) pg m(-3) and 3.80 x 10(-4)-9.14 x 10(-4) pg m(-3). HCBD and PCA were detected at the mean concentrations of 3.69 and 1.84 pg m(-3) in PM2.5, which is reported for the first time. Based on the results of statistical analysis, HCBD may come from the unintentional emission of manufacture or incineration of chlorinate-contained products but not coal combustion, while O-3-induced photoreaction was the potential source of PCA in PM2.5. The temporal distributions of CBs in PM2.5 were closely related to coal-driven or agricultural activities. Accordingly, our study reveals the contamination profiles of emerging POPs in PM2.5 from Taiyuan.

AB Diets are shown to be capable of shaping the gut microbiota of earthworm, while the effects of distinct foods on bacterial communities of different digestive tracts of earthworm are unknown. For this purpose, cow dung (CD) and domestic sludge (DS) were chosen as diets for earthworms (Eisenia fetida), and different gut contents, namely gizzard + foregut area, hindgut, and mature vermi-compost were sampled for Illumina sequencing analysis. We found that there existed significant reductions in bacterial diversity and abundance in the gizzard + foregut area, where there were stable bacteria with the ability of biodegradation of xenobiotics, such as Amycolatopsis, Methylobacterium, Ralstonia, Ochrobactrurn, and Sphingomonas. The decreases could be recovered in the hindgut and mature vermi-compost to different extents, suggesting that a bottleneck effect on the bacterial community occurred in the gizzard + foregut area. Beta-Proteobacteria was the most abundant subclass regardless of the different diets, and bacteria affiliated with gamma-, delta- and epsilon-subclasses were taken as food by the earthworms. Vermi-composts based on the various diets should be used differently according to different aims.

AB Carbon disulfide (CS2) is regarded as a common occupational poison that is widely used in the textile industry in China. Our previous research suggests that CS2 can induce significant implantation disorders in pregnant mice; however, the specific mechanism remains unclear. Uterine conception in mice must undergo decidualization, which is the prerequisite for propitious blastocyst implantation into the endometrium. Therefore, in this study, we established models of pregnant mice to explore the toxic effects of CS2 on decidualization to elucidate the basic mechanism of implantation disorder after CS2 exposure. The uterine tissues were immediately collected according to the predetermined endpoints to measure the expression levels of IGFBP1 and PRL (markers of decidualization differentiation), IL-11 (representing the secretory function of decidual cells), AKT and pAKT by western blotting, RT-PCR, immunohistochemical staining, H&E staining and ELISA. N-carbamoyl glutamic acid (NCG) acted as an agonist of AKT to verify the upstream regulatory mechanism of decidualization disorder by CS2. The results showed that the normal reaction of decidual transformation was obviously disrupted by CS2 upon 3.5 dpc and 4.5 dpc exposure. The blastocyst did not adhere to the epithelium after 3.5 dpc-exposure and did not invade the endometrium after 4.5 dpc-exposure, resulting in its suspension in the uterine cavity, stagnation and eventual loss. The proteins expression levels were decreased by 95.2% for IGFBP1 and 76.2% for PRL at the 4.5 dpc endpoint after 3.5 dpc CS2 exposure compared with the control. Simultaneously, the mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-11 in uterine tissues were significantly reduced by CS2, and consistent decreasing trends over time were observed for IGFBP1 and PRL, compared with the control. Additionally, the ratio of pAKT/AKT protein expression was decreased by 72.2% and 94.8% at 12 h and 18 h after 3.5 dpc exposure and by 53.3% and 74.3% at 6 h and 12 h after 4.5 dpc exposure, respectively, compared with the corresponding controls. Furthermore, NCG could recover the IGFBP1 and PRL protein expression, which was increased by 27.5% and 52.3% at 4.5 dpc and 6.5 dpc, respectively, after 3.5 dpc exposure for IGFBP1 and by 30.3% at 6.5 dpc after 4.5 dpc exposure for PRL, compared with CS2 exposure alone. Collectively, this study suggested that the decidualization disorder caused by CS2 at the window of implantation in pregnant mice, which is triggered by pAKT, contributed to the implantation disorder and eventually led to embryo loss. It is worth noting that our study may provide a new perspective and reference for exploring the toxic mechanism of implantation disorder and even infertility in harmful circumstances.

AB Rumen impaction by plastic waste (PW) is a common condition in the developing countries where ruminants are reared under extensive grazing. As heavy metals (HM) are used in the manufacture of plastic, we hypothesized that buffaloes with PW impaction would have suboptimal rumen function and higher content of HM in the rumen fluid, sera and body tissues. Buffaloes at an abattoir were categorized into impacted with PW or not (Group C and B, respectively; n = 30/group). From the animals of group C and B, rumen fluid and sera were collected ante-mortem, while muscle, liver and kidney were collected after exsanguination. Blood and rumen fluid of stall-fed buffaloes (Group A; n = 15) served as known negative control. Rumen function was assessed by protozoal density, motility, pH, methylene blue reduction time (MBRT) and sedimentation activity time (SAT). Concentration of HM such as mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu) in the body fluids, tissues and impacted PW was estimated by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). A significant decrease in the rumen protozoal density, motility and increase (P < 0.05) in the rumen fluid pH, MBRT and SAT were observed in group C as compared to group A and B. Concentration of Pb, Hg and Cd showed a moderate to strong significant negative correlation with rumen function indicators. Quantitatively, Cu content (ppm) was highest in PW with 0.9 +/- 0.04. The concentration of HM in the body fluids and tissues was significantly (P < 0.05) elevated in group C, but was below the toxic levels. In stall-fed buffaloes, Hg, Pb and Cd were undetectable in body fluids. Collectively, the results indicate that long term exposure of buffaloes to HM from PW affect the health, productivity and increase the risk of entering the food chain.

AB Aromatic hydrocarbons (AH) are widely distributed in nature, and many of them have been reported as relevant environmental pollutants and valuable carbon sources for different microorganisms. In this work, high-throughput sequencing of a metagenomic fosmid library was carried out to evaluate the functional and taxonomic diversity of genes involved in aromatic compounds degradation in oil-impacted mangrove sediments. In addition, activity-based approach and gas chromatography were used to assess the degradation potential of fosmid clones. Results indicated that AH degradation genes, such as monooxygenases and dioxygenases, were grouped into the following categories: anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds (20.34%), metabolism of central aromatic intermediates (35.40%) and peripheral pathways for catabolism of aromatic compounds (22.56%). Taxonomic affiliation of genes related to aromatic compounds metabolism revealed the prevalence of the classes Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria. Aromatic hydrocarbons (phenol, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene and benzopyrene) were used as the only carbon source to screen clones with degradation potential. Of the 2500 clones tested, 48 showed some respiratory activity in at least one of the five carbon sources used. The hydrocarbon degradation ability of the top ten fosmid clones was confirmed by GC-MS. Further, annotation of assembled metagenomic fragments revealed ORFs corresponding to proteins and functional domains directly or indirectly involved in the aromatic compound metabolism, such as catechol 2,3-dioxygenase and ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Finally, these data suggest that the indigenous mangrove sediment microbiota developed essential mechanisms towards ecosystem remediation of petroleum hydrocarbon impact.

AB Synergistic toxicity from multiple environmental pollutants poses greater threat to humans, especially to susceptible pregnant population. Here we evaluated combined toxicity from environment pollutants zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) and cadmium chloride (CdCl2) using two pregnant mice models established by oral administration during peri-implantation or organogenesis period. We found that exposures to combined pollutants only at organogenesis stage induced higher fetal deformity rate compared to co-exposures at peri-implantation stage. We further discovered that surface charge of ZnO NPs were modified after Cd2+ adsorption and the resulting nanoadducts caused more severe damages in placental barriers by causing shed endothelial cells and decreased expressions of tight junction proteins ZO1, occludin, claudin-4 and claudin-8. These cellular and molecular events enhanced maternal-fetal transfer of both pollutants and aggravated embryotoxicity. Our findings help elucidate synergistic embryotoxicity by nanoparticle/pollutant adducts and establish proper safety criteria for pregnant population in an era that nanotechnology-based products are widely used.

AB The contents of 12 trace metals (Hg, As, Pb, Cd, Ni, Cr, Zn, Cu, Co, Mn, Al and Fe) in two sediment cores (Hz11-P02 and Hz11-P09) from the Lake Hazar, one of the deepest natural lakes in Turkey, were examined to evaluate vertical concentration profiles, possible sources, pollution status and eco-environmental risks of these metals. The highest concentrations of Cd and As were detected in the upper part (0-10 cm depths) of core Hz11-P02, while Hg concentration was at a maximum in the upper part of core Hz11-P09. The concentrations of other metals except Cr were the highest in the bottom layer (depths below 100 cm) of both cores. Among trace metals (TMs), Cr, Ni, Al and Mn in core Hz11-P02 and Mn in core Hz11-P09 showed statistically significant correlations with core depth (p < 0.01). The mean concentrations of Hg, Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Co, Mn, Al and Fe in core Hz11-P02 were significantly higher than those in core Hz11-P09 (p < 0.01). Also, the mean enrichment factor, geoaccumulation index and contamination factor values of As, Cu, Cd, Zn, Pb and Hg were higher in core Hz11-P02. The ecological risk index (RI) values for core Hz11-P02 were between 150 and 300 in 40.3% of the samples, indicating "moderate ecological risk", whereas the RI values for core Hz11-P09 were < 150 in 100% of the samples, indicating "low ecological risk". Factor, cluster and correlation analyses, and contamination indices indicated that As and Hg in core Hz11-P02 predominantly originated from anthropogenic sources, while 12 trace metals in core Hz11-P09 derived from natural sources.

AB Nitrogen (N) forms not only affect cadmium (Cd) accumulation in plants, but also affect plant resistance to Cd toxicity. However, few researches have been reported underlying the mechanism of the relationship between nitrogen forms and plant resistance under Cd exposure. Here, we explored the mechanism on how different NO3-/NH4+ ratios affect antioxidase system and the glutathione-ascorbate cycle under five different ratios of NO3-/NH4+ (1:0, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 0:1) and three dosages of Cd exposure (0, 1, 5 mu mol L-1 Cd) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The results showed that high NO3- and high Cd exposure both significantly inhibited tissue growth of rice plants, and this inhibiting trend was mitigated with increasing NH4+ ratios as proved by the increased biomass and the decreased concentrations of malonaldehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as well as the levels of Cd contents in rice tissues. Additionally, high NH4+ ratios elevated the SOD activities in rice tissues, especially at high Cd treatment. However, other two antioxidases (CAT and APX) were insensitive to changes of NO3-/NH4+ ratios (except the full NO3-). Furthermore, high NH4+ ratios induced increasing of the efficiency of glutathione-ascorbate cycle (GSH-AsA) under two levels of Cd exposure, as evidenced by increasing concentrations of GSH and AsA and the activities of GR and DHAR in rice tissues. Overall, these results revealed that ammonium nutrition caused an enhancement resistance to Cd stress in rice plants was responsible for increasing of partial antioxidase system and the efficiencies of GSH-AsA cycle.

AB Cellular and humoral responses were evaluated in Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles when exposed to malathion, endosulfan, and their mixture. Each experiment was performed in the hemolymph collected at each exposure time (5 and 96 h) in duplicate; total hemocyte count, coagulation time, hemocyanin concentration, phenoloxidase (PO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were quantified. Survival was not affected by pesticides applied individually and mixed. Clotting time did not show significant differences concerning increase of concentration percentage of the pesticides tested. In organisms exposed to the pesticide mixture, hemocyanin decreased at 5 h of exposure as the concentration increased. Only in the malathion experiment did exposed shrimp to 10 and 50% of the LC50-96 h show significantly (p < 0.05) higher hemocyte contents. For malathion, significantly (p < 0.05) lower PO values in shrimp exposed to higher concentrations (10 and 50% of the LC50-96 h) were determined. While for the mixture treatment, high SOD value was determined at high exposure time and concentration. Malathion was the pesticide that showed an effect on some variables even at sublethal concentrations. The Continuous Concentration Criteria of the United States Environmental Protection Agency did not represent effects on the variables when they were compared with the averages of the control group.

AB Salinity represents a serious environmental threat to crop production and by extension, to world food supply, social and economic prosperity of the developing world. Salicylic acid (SA) is an endogenous plant signal molecule involved in regulating various plant responses to stress. In the present study, we characterized the regulatory role of exogenous SA for their ability to ameliorate deleterious effects of salt stress (0, 100, 150, 200 mM NaCl) in choysum plants through coordinated induction of antioxidants, ascorbate glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle, and the glyoxalase enzymes. An increase in salt stress dramatically declined root and shoot growth, leaf chlorophyll and relative water content (RWC), subsequently increased electrolyte leakage (EL) and osmolytes accumulation in choysum plants. Salt stress disrupted the antioxidant and glyoxalase defense systems which persuaded oxidative damages and carbonyl toxicity, indicated by increased H2O2 generation, lipid peroxidation, and methylglyoxal (MG) content. However, application of SA had an additive effect on the growth of salt-affected choysum plants, which enhanced root length, plant biomass, chlorophyll contents, leaf area, and RWC. Moreover, SA application effectively eliminated the oxidative and carbonyl stress by improving AsA and GSH pool, upregulating the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the enzymes associated with AsA-GSH cycle and glyoxalase system. Overall, SA application completely counteracted the salinity-induced deleterious effects of 100 and 150 mM NaCl and partially mediated that of 200 mM NaCl stress. Therefore, we concluded that SA application induced tolerance to salinity stress in choysum plants due to the synchronized increase in activities of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, enhanced efficiency of AsA-GSH cycle and the MG detoxification systems.

AB Background: For the sake of children's health, iodized salt supply has been stopped in many areas with excessive iodine in the drinking water, but children's iodine nutrition status and thyroid function after terminating the iodized salt supply is unknown. Objective We assessed the iodine nutrition, thyroid function and influencing factors for thyroid abnormalities in children from areas with different concentrations of water iodine; the supply of iodized salt has been stopped in high water iodine areas. This study aimed to evaluate whether the strategy of stopping the supplies of iodized salt alone is enough to avoid thyroid dysfunction in all areas with excess water iodine while still meeting the iodine nutrition needs of children.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in children from four areas with different drinking water iodine concentrations in Tianjin, China. The drinking water samplings and spot urine samples were collected to estimate the external and internal iodine exposure levels. The thyroid volume was measured, and blood samples were collected to assess thyroid function. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze risk factors for thyroid abnormalities. A dietary survey was conducted to determine the sources of iodine nutrition among the areas with different iodine concentrations in the drinking water.
   Results: In the area with a drinking water iodine concentration >= 300 mu g/L, the median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) in children was 476.30 (332.20-639.30) mu g/L, which was higher than that in other groups (all P < 0.05), and the prevalence of thyroid nodules and the thyroid goiter rate were higher than those in the < 100 mu g/L, 100-150 mu g/L and 150-300 mu g/L areas (all P < 0.01). Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that the risk of thyroid abnormalities was significantly increased in the UIC 200-299 mu g/L group (OR: 4.534; 95% CI: 1.565, 13.135; bootstrapped 95% CI: 1.689, 21.206, P = 0.004) and in the UIC >= 300 mu g/L group (OR: 6.962; 95% CI: 2.490, 19.460; bootstrapped 95% CI: 2.838, 32.570, P = 0.001) compared to the 100-199 mu g/L group. The iodine contribution rates from water in areas with water iodine concentrations >= 300 mu g/L are up to 63.04%.
   Conclusions: After termination of the iodized salt supply, the level of iodine nutrition of children in the area with drinking water iodine concentrations >= 300 mu g/L is still excessive. The water source needs to be replaced in this area. In the area with a water iodine concentration of 150-300 mu g/L, it is proposed that stopping the supply of iodized salt is sufficient to achieve the proper iodine nutrition status in children.

AB Microbial community of an organism plays an important role on its fitness, including stress responses. In this study, we investigated the effect of the culturable subset of soil microbial community (SMB) on the stress response of the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, upon exposure to one of the major soil contaminants, cadmium (Cd). Life history traits and the stress responses to Cd exposure were compared between SMB- and Escherichia colt strain OP50-fed worms. SMB-fed worms showed higher reproduction rates and longer lifespans. Also, the SMB-fed worms showed more tolerant response to Cd exposure. Gene expression profiling suggested that the chemical stress and immune response of worms were boosted upon SMB feeding. Finally, we investigated C. elegans gut microbial communities in the presence and absence of Cd in OP50- and SMB-fed C. elegans. In the OP50-fed worms, changes in microbial community by Cd exposure was severe, whereas in the SMB-fed worms, it was comparatively weak. Our results suggest that the SMB affects the response of C. elegans to Cd exposure and highlight the importance of the gut microbiome in host stress response.

AB Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a common organic solvent which can cause TCE hypersensitivity syndrome (THS) in exposure workers. THS is an adverse skin disorder with severe inflammatory kidney damage. Complement C3a receptor (C3aR) acts as a specific receptor for the key complement cleavage product C3a and involves multiple inflammatory responses, but the role of C3aR in TCE induced kidney inflammatory injury remains unknown. In this study, BALB/c mouse model of skin sensitization induced by TCE was set up in the presence or absence of C3aR antagonist (C3aRA). Kidney pathology and renal function, expression of inflammatory mediators and C3aR, changes in Th17 cell numbers, and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the kidney were examined. TCE sensitization produced histopathological and functional damage to the kidney, accompanied by increased levels of interleukin (IL-) 1 beta, IL-6, and IL-23. Local accumulation of Th17 cells and enhanced phosphorylation of STAT3 were also seen in the impaired kidney in TCE sensitization-positive mice. C3aR was mainly located in the impaired glomerulus and upregulated in TCE sensitization-positive mice. C3aRA pretreatment alleviated the structural and functional kidney damage and the inflammatory cytokine and Th17 responses by TCE sensitization, and specifically reduced the phosphorylation of STAT3. Together, our results demonstrate that C3aR signaling promotes the inflammatory responses and regulates the accumulation of Th17 phenotype via phosphorylation of STAT3 in TCE sensitization induced inflammatory kidney damage. C3aR may serve as a potential therapeutic target in TCE sensitization mediated kidney injury.

AB Leaf vegetables have strong capabilities to take up cadmium (Cd) compared to other vegetable varieties. Until now, the differences in Cd uptake and accumulation by leaf vegetables from different families and genera and the related health risks were unknown. To remedy this, we studied 71 leaf vegetables (multiple genotypes within 17 categories of vegetables) in soil cultivation experiments (3 Cd treatment levels). Results showed that at 2.12 mg kg(-1) Cd treatment, the dry weight of only five genotypic varieties from the families Brassicaceae and Asteraceae significantly decreased compared to the control, suggesting their weak Cd tolerances. Vegetables from the Brassicaceae, Asteraceae, Apiaceae, and Convolvulaceae families had stronger Cd absorption capabilities, whereas those from the Liliaceae and Amaranthaceae families had weaker ones. Cluster analysis found that the 17 vegetable categories could be divided into three groups: vegetables with high Cd accumulation capabilities were Lactuca sativa L.var. ramosa Hort. and Lactuca sativa var. longifoliaf. Lam. Vegetables with moderate Cd accumulation capabilities were bok choy, napa cabbage, choy sum, leaf mustard, Lactuca sativa L., Sonchus oleraceus L., celery, coriander, and water spinach. Vegetables with low Cd accumulation capabilities were cabbage, crown daisy, garlic chive, Allium ascalonicum, Gynura cusimbua, and edible amaranth. Estimated daily intake (EDI) and target hazard quotient (THQ) analysis results showed that 100% genotypes of vegetables from the Apiaceae and Convolvulaceae families had health risks; 100% genotypes of Lactuca sativa L., Sonchus oleraceus L., Lactuca sativa L. var. ramosa Hort., and Lactuca sativa var. longifoliaf. Lam from the Asteraceae family carried high risks. Of vegetables in the Brassicaceae family, 42.9% showed risks. Vegetables from the Amaranthaceae and Liliaceae families, Gynura cusimbua and crown daisy from the Asteraceae family, and cabbage from the Brassicaceae family all displayed relatively low risks (all 100%).

AB DNA methylation have been suggested as possible mediators of long-term health effects of environmental stressors. This study aimed to evaluate the potential therapy of methylation of S-adenosyl-1-methionine (SAM) on PFOS induced trangeneral reproductive toxicity. In this study, postnatal 5d Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, PFOS, PFOS + SAM, and PFOS + Decitabine (DAC). The F0 rats were exposed to 5 mg/kg PFOS and SAM or DAC until PND60. The development of the offsprings were monitored without PFOS exposure. The fertility in F0, F1 rats, and change in F1 testes were observed. The results were as follows. The significant increase in F0 pregnancy rate, and survival rate in F1 offspring in PFOS + SAM relative to PFOS group were observed. Changes of birth weights and physical development in F1 offspring with SAM were approached as a corresponding variation of the control after the deparation period. No pregnant in F1 maternal rats in the PFOS and DAC groups were found, but pregnant in the SAM group. Significantly decrease in the percentage of abnormal seminiferous tubules and increase in expression of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF+) spermatogonial stem cells in F1 testis compared with the PFOS group. Taken together, Methyl donor SAM improve PLZF + spermatogonia stem cell proliferation, attenuate damage in testicular tissue structure, which subsequently improve the transgenerational growth retard and infertility induced by PFOS chronic stress.

One French durum wheat cultivar (i.e. Sculptur) was exposed to low concentrations of Cd (5 nM or 100 nM) in hydroponics. After anthesis, the plants were fed with a solution enriched with the stable isotope Cd-111 to trace the newly absorbed Cd. Plants were sampled at anthesis and grain maturity to assess how plant growth, Cd uptake and partitioning among organs, as well as Cd remobilization, differed between the two Cd exposure levels. Durum wheat did not show any visual symptoms of Cd toxicity, regardless of which Cd treatment was applied. However, post-anthesis durum wheat growth was 14% penalized at 100 nM due to the large transpiration-based accumulation of Cd in leaves at this stage. The allocation of Cd to the grains was not restricted but enhanced at 100 nM compared to 5 nM. Both the root-to-shoot Cd translocation and the fraction of aboveground Cd allocated to grains were higher in plants exposed to 100 nM. Cadmium was remobilized exclusively from roots and stems, and remobilized Cd contributed on average to 40-45% of the Cd accumulated in mature grains, regardless of which Cd treatment was applied. The relevance of these results to decreasing the concentration of Cd in durum wheat grains is discussed.

AB Cadmium (Cd) is associated with barite; however, its biogeochemical characteristics in environments impacted by barium (Ba) mining are not known. Here, we first revealed the characteristics of Cd concentrations, distributions, and chemical forms in the soil-rice system in Ba mining areas. The associated exposure and risk assessments of Cd via rice consumption were also conducted. Elevated levels of Cd with a wide range of 0.054-91 mg/kg were found in paddy soils, approximately 63% of which exceeded the national Grade II value for soil Cd levels in China (0.3 mg/kg). A significant positive correlation between the soil Cd and soil Ba demonstrated that large amounts of Cd were released into the environment from Ba mining. Cadmium accumulated remarkably in the rice grains (0.007-3.5 mg/kg). The chemical forms in the rice plants indicated that most of the Cd was in the pectate/protein fraction (F2, 92% in the grains and 61-71% in the other tissues), followed by the residual fraction (F3, 7.1% in the grains, 27-38% in the other tissues). A minor portion of Cd was in the soluble and aminophenol fraction (F1, 0.44% in the grains, 0.26-1.4% in the other tissues). The positive correlations observed between the grain Cd and F2 in the roots, stems and leaves suggested that Cd in the rice grain was mainly from F2. Similarly, the root F2 was also positively correlated with that in the stems/leaves, indicating the critical role of F2 in Cd2+ migration in rice tissues. The estimated average hazard quotient (2.5) and annual excess lifetime cancer risk (21 x 10(-5) a(-1)) were higher than the safety levels of 1 and 5.0 x 10(-5) a(-1), respectively, showing that the dietary intake of Cd via rice consumption posed high health risks to residents. Our study demonstrated that more concerns should be paid to Cd contamination in Ba mining areas.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of different concentrations of chlorpyrifos (CPF), using L. culinaris apical cells as a biological indicator. L. culinaris seeds were exposed to different concentrations of chlorpyrifos (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 15 mg L-1) and a control solution based on distilled water. Subsequently, root growth was measured during 24, 48 and 72 h. Therefore, the mitotic index (MI) and the number of cellular abnormalities were determined at 72 h. According to the obtained results, a decrease in root size was observed in the concentrations of T5 (8 mg L-1) and T6 (10 mg L-1). On the other hand, it was evidenced that, through all the evaluated concentrations, the inhibition of mitosis in the concentrations of T5 (8 mg L-1), T6 (10 mg L-1) and T7 (15 mg L-1) was greater than 50%. Additionally, a variety of chromosomal abnormalities were reported, such as Micronuclei, sticky chromosomes in anaphase, chromosome disruption, irregular anaphase, nucleus absence, nuclear lesions, chromosomes grouped in metaphase, anaphase bridges, metaphase sticky chromosomes, present in all concentrations evaluated. Consequently, the presence of micronuclei in the concentrations of 8 mg L-1, 10 mg L-1 and 15 mg L-1 indicates that the CPF is a highly cytotoxic substance to L. culinaris. Therefore, L. culinaris is a plant species that offers a feasible experimental model to be implemented in laboratory studies with the purpose to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of pesticides.

AB To study source-specific carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) under diverse anthropogenic activities, PM2.5-bound PAHs were detected in Beijing in four periods. PAHs in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting (APEC) was much lower than that in after-APEC period. The highest PAHs concentration was in heating period (303 ng/m(3)). Sources were quantified by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). In heating period, due to high emissions, weak diffusion, low degradation and evaporation, high contributions of all sources were observed, and both absolute and relative contributions of coal combustion increased. Changed contributions in during-APEC and after-APEC periods implied effectiveness of reinforced emission control, especially for coal combustion and vehicles. Furthermore, variations of sources-specific carcinogenicity and mutagenicity were investigated. In non-heating period, contributions of gasoline exhaust (38.4% TEQ: Toxic Equivalent Quantity, 33.7% MEQ: Mutagenic Equivalent Quantity) and diesel exhaust (53.8% TEQ, 57.9% MEQ) dominated both carcinogenic and mutagenic risks. Coal combustion sharply increased in heating period, attributing 27.5% TEQ and 21.7% MEQ. In during-APEC period, all contributions to carcinogenicity and mutagenicity were lower than those in after-APEC period, but "others" linked with regional transport contributed increased fractions (above 20%). Sources-specific carcinogenicity and mutagenicity under diverse anthropogenic activities, especially for APEC meeting with reinforced control, gave a new insight into assessment of control measures based on health risks.

AB In the present study, to investigate the prevention mechanism of proanthocyanidins from lotus seedpod (LSPCs) on methyl mercuric chloride (MMC) induced neurotoxicity, neuron/astrocyte cells were co-cultured to simulate the microenvironment in vivo to the greatest extent. The results showed that, compared with MMC group, pretreatment with LSPCs not only improved cell survival rate, decreased the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), decreased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and prevented the increase of intracellular [Ca2+]i, but also significantly increased the total anti-oxidation capacity (T-AOC) (p <0.05), the levels of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) (p < 0.05), glutathione (GSH) (p < 0.05), and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) <0.01). Besides, LSPCs up-regulated the expression of transcriptional factor Nrf2/HO-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, LSPCs reduced the expression of Bax protein, significantly increased the expression of Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, beta-III-Tubulin, SYN, and Arc proteins. The expression of these proteins is mainly regulated by genes and reflects the changes of genes functions. Taken together, these results suggested that LSPCs could enhance cellular antioxidant defense capacity through regulating the activation of Nrf2/HO-1, and involving the inhibition of mitochondria-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway.

AB Adding organic amendments to soil could modify the bioavailability of herbicides and lead to changes in the microbial community's activity and structure. The objective here was to study the dissipation and total mass balance of C-14-labeled prosulfocarb applied at two rates (4 and 10 mg kg(-1)) in unamended and green compost (GC)-amended soil. Soil dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profile analysis were determined to evaluate the effect of herbicide residues on microbial community's activity and structure over the dissipation period. The dissipation rate of prosulfocarb decreased after soil amendment due to higher herbicide adsorption by the amended soil. The 50% dissipation time (DT50) increased 1.7 times in the unamended soil when the concentration of prosulfocarb increased 2.5 times. The mass balance results indicate that the sum of water and organic extractable fractions represented the highest amounts up to the dissipation of 50% C-14-prosulfocarb. The HC-herbicide was then mainly mineralized (up to 11%-31%) or formed non-extractable residues (up to 35%-44%). The amount of C-14-prosulfocarb residues extracted with methanol was slightly higher in amended soils than in unamended ones. C-14-prosulfocarb mineralization was higher in unamended soils than in amended ones. The formation of non-extractable residues was continuous, and increased over time. Soil DHA decreased in the unamended soil and was maintained in the GC-amended soil at the end of the assay. The microbial structure was barely disturbed over the prosulfocarb degradation process, although it was clearly influenced by the application of GC. The results obtained reveal the influence organic amendment has on herbicide bioavailability to decrease its biodegradation and buffer its impact on the soil microbial structure.

AB Cadmium(Cd) is a serious environmental and occupational contaminant that represents a serious health hazard to humans and other animals. Reproductive health problems have been reported in men exposed to Cd. Testicular damage is one of the deleterious effects due to Cd exposure. Cd-induced testicular toxicity is mediated through oxidative stress, inflammation, testosterone inhibition and apoptosis. Thus, the present study was performed to assess the possible protective role of infliximab (IFX), anti-TNF alpha agent, against Cd-induced testicular damage and spermiotoxicity in rats. The rats were randomly allotted into six experimental groups: control, Cd sulphate treated, Cd sulphate treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg), Cd sulphate with infliximab (7 mg/kg), infliximab alone (5 mg/kg), and infliximab alone (7 mg/kg). The control group received saline. To induce testicular damage, Cd sulphate (1.5 mg/100 gm body weight/day) was dissolved in normal saline and orally administrated for 3 consecutive weeks. The rats in infliximab-treated groups were given a weekly dose of 5 mg/kg/week or 7 mg/kg/week of infliximab intraperitoneally. In the current study Cd exposure reduced sperm count, markers of testicular function, sperm motility as well as gene expression of testicular 3 beta-HSD and 17 beta-HSD and serum testosterone level. Additionally, it increased testicular oxidative stress, inflammatory and apoptotic markers. The histopathologic studies supported the biochemical findings. Treatment with infliximab significantly attenuated Cd-induced injury verified by the restoration of testicular architecture, enhancement of steroidogenesis, preservation of spermatogenesis, modulation of the inflammatory reaction along with suppression of oxidative stress and apoptosis. It was concluded that infliximab, through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, represents a potential therapeutic option to protect the testicular tissue from the detrimental effects of Cd.

AB Bioindicators are promising tools used to detect the long-term effects of selected biosolids on plants development and should be implemented before large-scale supplementation of sewage sludge into the soil. The presented study shows the impact of sewage sludge application on metal-sensitive toxicity biological parameters (biomarkers) in Sinapis alba including: germination, root length, the activity of guaiacol peroxidase, the chlorophyll content, the level of DNA damage and the expression level of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL) and metallothionein (mt). We evaluated data from selected biomarkers in order to broaden our understanding of plants defense mechanisms against heavy metal contamination and the application of sewage sludge into soils. Overall, in contaminated soil after supplementation with both municipal sewage sludges, an increase in toxicity was noticed in DNA damage, mt and rbcl expression and total chlorophyll content. The supplementation of both soils with municipal sewage sludge caused a two-time induction in the mt expression. Moreover, clean soil supplemented with sewage sludge caused an increase in DNA damage shown as the tail moment from approximately 12 mu m on control to 40 mu m after supplementation. Even if those biosolids increased the initial germination, roots length, and biomass in comparison to the unamended soil, the toxicity was evidenced with other stress markers. Results showed, that in order to accurately assess the influence of sewage sludge application on plants the use of several specific biomarkers is required for safe land restoration. The conducted study also confirmed, both under biochemical and genotoxic tests, that iron enrichment for biosolids or contaminated soil can significantly reduce the bioavailability and toxicity of other metals.

AB Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L.) was more tolerance to Cs than some sensitive plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Vicia faba, and may have a special detoxification mechanism. In this study, the effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, the antioxidant enzyme system and chelation system in Indian mustard were studied by observing different plant physiological responses. In addition, we focused on the analysis of gene regulatory networks related to ROS formation, ROS scavenging system, and other stress-response genes to Cs exposure using a transcriptome-sequencing database. The results showed that ROS and malonaldehyde content in seedlings increased significantly in Cs-treatment groups. The enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase were increased, and the synthesis of antioxidants glutathione, phytochelatin and metallothionein also increased under Cs treatment. Further analysis showed that ROS formation pathways were primarily the photosynthetic electron transport chain process and photorespiration process in the peroxisome. Antioxidant enzyme systems and the respiratory burst oxidase homolog protein mediated signal transduction pathway played a key role in ROS scavenging. In summary, one of the mechanisms of tolerance and detoxification of Indian mustard to Cs was that it enhanced the scavenging ability of antioxidant enzymes to ROS, chelated free Cs ions in cells and regulated the expression of related disease-resistant genes.

AB Despite previous efforts and the rapid progress on elucidating the impact of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) on the environment, its effects on riparian plants, a key component of aquatic ecosystems, are still poorly understood. A 48-day hydroponic experiment was carried out on two typical riparian species (Atoms calamus and Phragmites communis) to examine the toxic effects of PFOS on these plants. The results showed that, at high concentration (more than 10 mg L-1), PFOS could prevent chlorophyll accumulation (reduced by 13.7-22.2% at 10 mg L-1 PFOS and 22.4-30.0% at 50 mg L-1 PFOS for 48 days) and soluble protein synthesis (reduced by 2.3-9.0% at 10 mg L-1 PFOS and 10.6-26.8% at 50 mg L-1 PFOS for 48 days). Contrastingly, less than 1 mg L-1 of PFOS could induce chlorophyll accumulation (increased by 18.6% in A. calamus roots, 11.3% in A. calamus leaves, and 13.6% in P. communis roots at 1 mg L-1 PFOS for 3 days) and soluble protein synthesis (increased by 6.1% in A. calamus roots, 18.4% in A. calamus leaves, 9.7% in P. communis roots, 23.4% in P. communis stems, and 24.0% in P. communis leaves, at 1 mg L-1 PFOS for 6 days). In addition, PFOS led to oxidative stress, as revealed by the elevated concentrations of malonaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide, and reduced the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (reduced by 10.3% in P. communis stems at 50 mg L-1 PFOS for 48 days), catalase (reduced by 20.6-50.3% in test species at 50 mg L-1 PFOS for 48 days), and peroxidase (reduced by 24.9-37.7% in test species at 50 mg L-1 PFOS for 48 days). The biomarkers of both plants changed rapidly in the first half of the experiment (0-24 days) and stabilized in the second half of the experiment (24-48 days). The risk and related factors of PFOS on riparian plants were evaluated by using these biomarkers. Experiments showed that P. communis was more resistant to low concentration (< 10 mg L-1) of PFOS than A. calamus.

AB Passive sampling techniques have been considered robust tools for monitoring freely dissolved concentrations of contaminants in aquatic systems. However, few passive samplers are currently available for the simultaneous sampling of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic chemicals. In this study, we developed a novel passive sampler (a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance sorbent-embedded cellulose acetate membrane (HECAM)) for estimating the time -weighted average (TWA) concentrations of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic organic contaminants in water. In our laboratorial controlled dynamic experiments, the accumulation results of thirty-seven target chemicals (including organophosphorus flame retardants, phenols, estrogens, organophosphorus pesticides, and triazine herbicides) with a wide polarity range (1.44 < log K-ow < 9.49) in the HECAM followed first -order kinetics well, and the passive sampling parameters were estimated successfully. The estimated sampling rates for the target chemicals in the HECAM ranged from 0.14 to 6.90 L d(-1) in the laboratory experiment, and the log K-sw (equilibrium partition coefficient between the sampler and water) values ranged from 2.75 to 6.00. The HECAM exhibited high sampling rate for moderately hydrophilic and moderately hydrophobic chemicals. The field validation study in an urban river resulted in the detection of four target chemicals (tris(chloroisopropyl) phosphate, tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl)phosphate, prometryn, and 4-tert-octylphenol) by the HECAM at estimated TWA concentrations of 10.9-179.5 ng L-1, which were in agreement with the measured levels found in traditional grab samples by solid -phase extraction. In summary, both the laboratory tests and field deployment showed practicable results for the HECAM passive sampling, which suggests that it is an efficient approach for simultaneous monitoring of hydrophilic and hydrophobic organic contaminants in water.

AB Background: Despite decades of research and intervention programs, the epidemic of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in the Taihang Mountain area of north China has not seen convincing explanation by any risk factor yet and the incidence has not seen a substantial decrease. Based on recently disclosed association of aridity and wheat consumption with esophageal cancer, we revisited the hypothesis of biogenic silica in esophageal cancer development.
   Methods: From the archives of the Pathology Department of Heping Hospital, Changzhi Medical College, we selected three pairs of formalin-fixed samples, tumor tissues and distant normal tissues, of three patients operated for ESCC who had no history of workplace exposure to silica dust. Two pairs of dried tissue samples were used for phytolith (silica body) analysis and another pair for microanalysis with Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM).
   Results: One of the phytoliths in ESCC tumor tissue was similar to the prickle hair on the surface of wheat bract. In the mineral particles detected in the tumor tissue the predominant elements were Si, Ca, and P, whereas Si signals were not obvious in the distant normal tissue.
   Conclusions: The preliminary findings on the detection of phytoliths and the higher than normal Si concentration in ESCC tumor tissue warrants further testing the role of biogenic silica in esophageal cancer.

ID CANCER STEM-CELLS
AB Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been closely linked to increased morbidity and mortality of lung cancer worldwide. However, the role of PM2.5 in the etiology of lung cancer and the mechanism involved in PM2.5 induced lung cancer are largely unknown. In this study, we performed chronic exposure animal model to investigate the carcinogenetic mechanisms of PM2.5 by targeting the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSC) properties through Notchl signal pathway. The antagonism of Notchl signal pathway was carried out in vitro cell lines of A549 and BEAS-2B to block EMT and CSC. We found that chronic PM2.5 exposure mice lung tissue pathology showed atypical hyperplasia of bronchiolar epithelium. Then, we discovered that chronic PM2.5 exposure induced notable EMT event and obvious CSC properties indicating the developing process of cell malignant behaviors. EMT characterized with decreased protein expression of E-cadherin and increased protein expression of Vimentin. CSC properties induced by chronic PM2.5 exposure characterized with increased cell-surface markers (ABCG2 and ALDH1A1) and self-renewal genes (SOX2 and OCT4). Furthermore, PM2.5 exposure activate Notch signal pathway by increasing expression of Notchi and Hesl. At last, we blocked Notch signal pathway by inhibitor 804929097 in vitro to explore the underlying mechanism mediating PM2.5 induced EMT and CSC. We found that blocking Notchl could prevent PM2.5 induced malignant behaviors including EMT and CSC in A549 and BEAS-2B. These data revealed that the induction of EMT and CSC properties were involved in the lung cancer risk of PM2.5 in vivo, and blocking-up Notchi may negatively regulate EMT and CSC to suppress the invasion and migration in vitro, thereby putatively serving as a novel therapeutic target for PM2.5 induced lung cancer.

AB In order to better understand the composition and driving factors of the bacterial community in Mollisols, we selected 9 representative facility agricultural lands in Mollisol area of China for sampling, and described it on a larger spatial scale. Soil bacterial community structure in these 9 regions (determined by high-throughput sequencing analysis) showed significant differences at the genus level. The correlation between bacterial community composition and soil properties, contaminants and geographical latitude showed that the diversity of bacterial community was still strongly correlated with pH and SOM under the influence of phthalates (P < 0.05). Principal component Analysis (PCA) showed that soil properties (i.e. pH, organic matter, stacking density, the content of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus) and PAEs level rather than geographic latitude were main drivers of differences in bacterial community structure. These factors account for 73.04% of the total variation of the bacterial community. Among them, PAEs act as a typical pollutant is the main factor driving the composition of bacterial community in facility agriculture Mollisols. This shows that PAEs is a potential pollution risk factor, which has important guiding significance for the sustainable and healthy development of agriculture in Mollisol area.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a kind of persistent toxic substances, which have been frequently detected in environmental media. However, studies on their occurrences and distributions in drinking water are insufficient and their composition profiles in drinking water are still not clear. In this study, we investigated 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in drinking water from different administrative level cities throughout mainland China, analyzed the influences of anthropogenic activities on PAHs, and assessed the health risk of the PAHs in drinking water. On the national scale, the sum concentration of the 16 priority-controlled PAHs (Sigma(16)PAHs) designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) was in a range of 3.89-231.39 (mean 56.25) ng L-1. With the decline of Sigma(16)PAHs, the concentration of 3-ring PAHs decreased, while its proportion increased, indicating 3-ring PAHs might be more difficult to remove than other PAHs in drinking water. The geographical distribution of PAHs in drinking water of China was in a descending order of West (69.81 ng L-1) > South (61.95 ng L-1) > North (58.63 ng L-1) > East (39.21 ng L-1) > Northeast China (37.93 ng L-1). Sigma(16)PAHs in drinking water of Prefecture-level City was the greatest (71.49 ng L-1) followed by Provincial Capital (52.12 ng L-1), County-level City (50.98 ng L-1) and Municipality (33.92 ng L-1). Sigma(16)PAHs was significantly negatively correlated with the per capita GDP of sampling city (P < 0.01, n = 78), implying that waterworks is an effective way to control and reduce PAH pollution in drinking water. The carcinogenic risk of the 16 PAHs in drinking water of China was much greater than the non-carcinogenic risk.

AB In aquatic systems, antimony (Sb) is found in the water column and associated with sediment particles being bioavailable to organisms. Consequently, toxic effects have been detected in benthic invertebrates, but the toxicity after Sb exposure in Chironomidae have not been investigated. Were investigated DNA damage, activities of cholinesterase (ChE), alpha and beta esterase (EST-alpha, EST-beta), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lipid peroxidation after acute (48 h) and subchronic exposure (8 d). We also investigated the effects of subchronic (8 d) on development of larvae and chronic (25 d) Sb exposure on emergence and size of adults of Chironomus sancticaroli. Were analyze Sb nominal concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 800 mu g.L-1. Genotoxic effects occurred at higher concentrations upon acute (50, 800 mu g.L-1) and sub chronic exposure (50 mu g.L-1). Acute exposure increased ChE, EST-alpha, EST-beta, and GST activities. Subchronic Sb exposure increased EST-alpha activity at 0.2 mu g.L-1 and GST activity at 5 mu g.L-1. CAT activity increased at all concentrations while increasing lipid peroxidation levels were observed (1 mu g.L-1, 5 mu g.L-1 and 501 mu g.L-1) indicating oxidative stress. All concentrations of Sb delayed larval development and decreased the number of emerging adults. At high concentrations (50, 500, 800 mu g.L-1), the emerging adults were smaller. In conclusion, these varying genotoxic, biochemical and biological effects of Sb make a notable impact on the reproduction and population dynamics of C. sancticaroli

AB In present study we aimed to investigate the literature in the form of systematic review to determinate the concentrations of some toxic metals (arsenic, lead, and cadmium) in widely consumed rice brands in Iran and their related health risks. International and Iranian national databases were searched carefully with appropriate keywords for papers on toxic metal contamination of rice from Agust-2000 to Agust-2018. Initially, 560 articles were found, of which only the 50 papers fit the inclusion criteria and were selected for further analysis. The Monte Carlo Simulation was applied to generate missing data (mean, standard deviation, data distribution and sample size) of toxic metal concentration in some papers. Then, statistical analysis, health risk assessment, and uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were performed. The results indicated that approximately 88% of rice consumed in Iran (including Iranian, Pakistani and Indian rice) do not meet the national standard and WHO/FAO guideline requirements and their related health risks are unacceptable. The risks of arsenic and lead in Indian rice and cadmium in Iranian rice were considerably higher than others. In conclusion, according to our findings, In conclusion, it is necessary to prevent toxic metals contamination of rice by modifying cultivation patterns and, also, prevent low-quality rice brands to be imported.

AB Lead (Pb) is a type of toxic metal that can hurt the immune system. Selenium (Se) can reduce the damage caused by heavy metals. To investigate the effects of Se against Pb on bird immune cells, as well as the immunotoxin mechanism of Pb, Se supplementation and/or Pb poisoning chicken models were established. One hundred eighty 1-year-old broiler chickens were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6). The four groups were the control group, the selenium-rich group (Se group), the Pb supplementation group (Pb group) and the Se and Pb compound group (Se + Pb group). The peripheral blood lymphocytes of chickens were collected to test the selenoproteins and cytokine mRNA levels at 30 and 60 d. Determination of the content of Se and Pb in the serum, principal component analysis and ingenuity pathway analysis were performed at the two time points. As a result, Pb exposure increased the content of Pb, activating the Th1/Th2 pathway in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Additionally, this experiment showed that Se supplementation and Pb exposure could influence the mRNA levels of selenoproteins and cytokines in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of chickens. However, all of the parameters that we detected in the experiment indicated that Se supplementation could alleviate the increase of selenoproteins and cytokine mRNA levels and the Th1/Th2 imbalance induced by Pb in peripheral blood lymphocytes. In summary, Se can alleviate the toxic effects caused by Pb in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of chickens, suggesting the antagonism between Se and Pb.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is an antimicrobial preservative used in personal care products. Here, we have studied the phototoxicity, photogenotoxicity of TCS and its molecular mechanism involving p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway under UVB/sunlight exposure. We found that TCS showed photodegradation and photoproducts formation under UVB/sunlight. In silica study suggests that photosensitized TCS loses its preservative property due to the formation of its photoproducts. Photosensitized TCS induces significant O-2 center dot-, center dot OH generation and lipid peroxidation via type-I photochemical reaction mechanism under UVB/sunlight exposure. We performed intracellular study of TCS on human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT cell-line) under the ambient intensity of UVB (0.6 mW/cm(2)) and sunlight exposure. Significant intracellular ROS generation was observed through DCFH2-DA/DHE assays along with a significant reduction in cell viability through MTT and NRU assays in photosensitized TCS. Photosensitized TCS also induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as shown through ER-tracker/DAPI staining and Ca2+ release. It further induced cell cycle arrest through the sub-G1 phase augmentation and caused lysosomal/mitochondrial destabilization. Photogenotoxicity was shown through significant tail DNA, micronuclei and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) formations. Cell signaling mechanism implicated upregulated expression of cleaved Caspase-3, Bax, phospho-p38, phospho-JNK and cytochrome C, thereby downregulated Bcl-2 expressions. Results advocate that TCS induces phototoxic effects via type I mediated photodynamic mechanism and activation of MAPK pathway. We conclude that photoexcited TCS may be deleterious to human health at the ambient environmental intensities of sunlight reaching at the earth's surface. Therefore, it may be replaced by alternative safe preservative.

AB Pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) has been widely utilized as a fungicide to control diseases. However, toxic effect data of PCNB on terrestrial invertebrate are not available till now. Herein, the earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed to soil containing different levels of PCNB. Mortality, weight, accumulation, and physiological indexes of earthworms were determined on certain days. PCNB inhibited the growth of earthworms and induced a significant increase in the activity of antioxidative enzymes. ROS, SOD, and MDA of earthworms in the highest treatment group were 6.8, 4.4, and 3.8 times higher than those in the control group, respectively. In addition, earthworm coelomocytes were successfully extracted, cultured, and innovatively employed in in-vitro toxicity test to evaluate the toxic effect of PCNB. The biomarkers utilized in in-vitro toxicity test, including cell viability, intracellular ROS and extracellular LDH showed significant correlations with the PCNB in the culture media, indicating that the in-vitro toxicity test may serve as a useful tool for toxic assessment of pollutants to earthworms and other organisms.

AB The liver is one of the major targets of hormones, including thyroid hormones (THs), and many industrial chemicals, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Those compounds may permeate the placenta barrier and pose a risk for embryonic development. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the toxic effects of those kind of industrial chemicals during liver development. In this study, to mimic liver specification in vitro, we differentiated human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into functional hepatocyte-like cells. We performed this differentiation process in presence of two THs, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), with the purpose of identifying biomarkers for toxicity screening. TH exposure (3, 30 and 300 nM) yielded to hepatocytes with impaired glycogen storage ability and abnormal lipid droplets' accumulation. Global gene expression analysis by RNA-seq identified a number of genes responsible for hepatic differentiation and function which were affected by 30 nM T3 and T4. Those differentially expressed genes were used to assess the potential developmental liver toxicity of two famous environmental pollutants, 2, 2, 4, 4-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) and decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209), at 10 nM to 1 mu M treatments. Our findings demonstrate that BDE-47 and BDE-209, dysregulated pathways such as "chemical carcinogenesis", "steroid hormone biosynthesis" and "drug metabolism-cytochrome P450". Moreover, we were able to identify a set of 17 biomarkers, very useful to predict the potential developmental hepatotoxicity of industrial chemicals.

AB The widespread use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) has raised public concern due to their potential toxic effects on humans and the environment. Although some studies have evaluated the toxicity of nanomaterials in vertebrates, studies on their hazardous effects on insects are limited. Here we focused on different concentrations of AgNPs to silkworms, a promising model organism, to evaluate their toxic effects by omits analysis. After the silkworms were fed with 100 mg L-1 AgNPs, transcriptomics analysis showed differential expression of 43 genes: 39 upregulated and 4 downregulated. These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in the digestion process, various metabolic pathways, transmembrane transport and energy synthesis. Proteomic results for silkworms fed with 400 mg L-1 AgNPs revealed 14 significantly differentially expressed proteins: 11 down regulated and 3 upregulated. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results showed that the expression levels of eight proteins were similar to the transcription levels of their corresponding genes. As the AgNPs concentration was increased, the expression of digestive enzymes was downregulated, which damaged the silkworm tissue and suppressed the activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase and the protein HSP 1, causing oxidative stress and the production of reactive oxygen species, which had toxic effects on the silkworm digestive system. Histopathological results showed that treatment with 400 mg L-1 AgNPs destroyed the basal lamina and the columnar cells, caused adverse effects on tissues and had the potential to induce harmful effects on the digestive system. The data presented herein provide valuable information on the hazards and risks of nanoparticle contamination.
   Main finding: AgNPs would downregulate some digestive enzymes, damage the tissue of midgut in silkworm, meantime induce the accumulation of reactive oxygen species which may cause oxidative stress.

AB Photolysis and microbial activity are relatively obvious in shallow, eutrophic waters with low dissolved oxygen content. Ubiquitous humic acid (HA) can act as electron acceptor and be reduced by bacterial under such conditions, and the reduced form of humic acid (RHA) plays an important role in the photolysis contaminants. In this study, anaerobic 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) photodegradation was performed along with biodegradation by Shewanella putrefaciens mediated by HA. The mechanism of such coupled photolysis and biodegradation of EE2 was thus elucidated. The removal rate in such coupled degradation in the presence of 10 mgCL(-1) of HA at pH 8.0 was greater than that of either photolysis or biodegradation alone. HA which had been reduced in a double-chamber microbial fuel cell showed better promotion to EE2 photodegradation than fresh HA. Reactive species scavenging experiments indicated that hydroxyl radical and excited triplet states of HA were primary contributors to EE2 photodegradation in anaerobic conditions. More of them were produced from RHA than from pristine HA. Besides, the degraded EE2 solutions inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 human cancer Cells. These findings improve our understanding of the environmental transformation of EE2 in the shallow, anoxic waters.

AB We conducted a broad-scale ecological effect assessment of agricultural chemicals where we combined biomonitoring databases of riverine invertebrate communities with predictions of environmental concentrations of chemicals, based on an exposure evaluation model for Japanese rivers. One of the difficulties of broad-scale assessment arises from the use of biomonitoring databases for which the monitoring sites are often spread across different geographic regions, with varying species compositions and heterogeneous environmental factors. This problem was circumvented using a trait-based approach, which extracts patterns of ecological properties of species response to changes in either chemical concentration or environmental factors. We identified groups of species that had particular trait categories that were negatively correlated with herbicide pollutants (the predicted concentration divided by the acute toxic concentration). Numerical abundances of species groups classified by trait categories had more sensitive responses to herbicide pollutants than total species abundance. However, a finding that trait diversity and species diversity indexes in the communities examined did not change with herbicide pollutants means that the two indexes showed resistance to chemical stresses. We inferred that the reason for the greater resistance in terms of trait and species diversity was that compositional changes of species caused by increasing herbicide pollutions were simply a shift from communities composed of susceptible species to those composed only of tolerant species.

AB The continuous production of low molecular weight (LMW) organic acids by plants and microorganisms coupled with the continuous presence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in soils is a guarantee that the mobility of heavy metals in soils will be controlled. The effects of citrate, oxalate, and EPS on the adsorption of Pb by an acidic Ultisol were studied both as a function of pH and ionic strength. Electrokinetic potential measurements were also employed to observe to what extent each ligand affected the surface charge property of the Ultisol. All the ligands shifted the zeta potential of the Ultisol to the negative direction, implying that the surface charge of the soil became more negative. The effect on the zeta potential of the soil was observed in the order of oxalate (>) citrate (>) EPS. The quantity of Pb adsorbed at each pH (3.0-7.0) reflected the corresponding change in the zeta potential as induced by each ligand. The presence of the ligands shifted the isoelectric point of the Ultisol from 4.8 to 3.2 for the EPS system and below 3.0 for the citrate and oxalate systems. More Pb was adsorbed in the presence of oxalate than in the presence of citrate and EPS. The two most outstanding mechanisms that governed the adsorption of Pb by the Ultisol were (1) electrostatic attraction which was supported by the increase in negative zeta potential of the Ultisol and, (2) complexation which was supported by the lesser proportion of Pb adsorbed in the citrate system at higher pH and also by the spectroscopic data for EPS. The combination EPS + citrate + oxalate was more effective in enhancing the adsorption of Pb than the combination EPS + oxalate and EPS + citrate.

A selective culture medium consisting of wastewater and agar (WA) restrained fungi that could be randomly present (94% of the 51 taxa retrieved on WA were sample specific), overcoming the problem of fast growing fungi or mycoparasite fungi. Moreover, WA allowed the isolation of fungi with a possible role in the degradation of pollutants typically present in the two wastewaters. Phoma medicaginis var. medicaginis, Chaetomium globosum, and Geotrichum candidum were mainly found in municipal wastewater, whereas Pseudallescheria boydii, Scedosporium apiospermum, Aspergillus pseudodeflectus, and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis were typical of landfill leachate.

AB R.communis L. has high capability to accumulate nickel which is a trace nutrient for higher plants and also an environmental contaminant causes toxicity related symptoms at higher concentrations. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to be important modulators of responses against heavy metal stress for detoxification of the metal. In this study, we experimentally measured and validated the transcript levels of the seven heavy metal stress response-related miRNAs and the expression levels of target genes in both leaf and root tissues of R. communis L. subjected to three different concentrations of nickel stress via qRT-PCR quantification. The results demonstrated differential regulations of heavy metal stress-responsive miRNAs and their putative targets in both tissues in same stress treatments. This dynamic regulation suggest that regulatory processes differ between the tissues under nickel stress. Our data suggest that, miR838 was the most responsive to the Ni2+ stress. miR398 target gene Cu-Zn/SOD was found to be up-regulated in both root and leaf tissues. The relations between TCP and expression levels of miR159 and miR319 were also found statistically significant exclusive to leaf tissues. In leaf tissue, changes in miR395 level and its putative target genes, sulphate transporter and sulphate adenyltransferase gene were found in relation whereas, only expression level of sulphate transporter represented a statistically significant relation in root tissue. The sharp decrease in transcript levels of 2r3 myb gene at lower nickel dose suggest to investigate the role of r2r3 myb and the all MYB family members in primary and secondary metabolisms against nickel stress.

AB Copper, a common heavy metal, may be beneficial for or poisonous to microbial activity. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of different copper ion concentrations on the nitrogen removal performance of Arthrobacter arilaitensis strain Y-10 and Pseudomonas taiwanensis strain J488. The non-competitive inhibition model was employed to evaluate the 50% inhibition concentrations (IC50 values) of copper ions toward the pure strains. In the absence of magnesium ions, a low concentration of copper (0.1 mg/L) significantly enhanced the ammonium removal ability of strain Y-10 and its removal efficiency increased by 10.88% compared with the control treatment. Copper ranging from 0 to 0.1 mg/L had no significant effect on the ammonium removal capacity of strain J488. After adding 9.90 mg/L of magnesium to the basal medium, the effects of copper on nitrification of ammonium or denitrification of nitrate or nitrite were also assessed. In these conditions, 0.25 mg/L copper ions could strongly inhibit the ammonium, nitrate and nitrite removal activities for strain Y-10. For strain J488, no clear deterioration in ammonium removal efficiency was observed at copper ion concentrations below 0.5 mg/L, but 0.25 mg/L copper ions significantly inhibited nitrate and nitrite removal efficiencies, which were only 45.88% and 6.35%, respectively. The IC50 values of copper ions for nitrate and nitrite removal by strain Y-10 were 0.195 and 0.090 mg/L respectively; for strain J488, the IC50 values were 0.175 and 0.196 mg/L. The magnesium ions could improve the cell growth, nitrogen removal efficiency and copper ion resistance of bacteria.

AB Inhalable environmental toxicants can induce pulmonary malfunction resulting abnormal respiratory conditions. The traditional methods currently available to detect the respiratory condition of animals rely on differential pressure transducers and signal amplifiers. In comparison, current machine vision application requires little hardware. But it is unsuitable for respiratory condition tests of experimental animals reflecting respiratory toxicities of inhalable pollutants. In this study, we establish a new automatic method of machine vision analysis using a model that has mice inhaling aqueous aerosol with different concentrations of CdCl2 (0, 1, 3, 5 mM 2 h/day) for 7 days as simulant occupational exposure of inhalable Cd and analyze respiratory conditions such as respiratory rate, rhythm index, drive index and exchange index. Additionally, the models with different degrees of lung damage in mice are further tested and verified by the concentrations of cadmium accumulated in the lungs and the analyses on pulmonary porosity, fibrosis and inflammation. Machine vision analysis can identify the abnormal respiratory conditions of mice. Respiratory rate and rhythm index increase after exposure to cadmium. In the individuals with mild lung damage, respiratory drive index and exchange index in treatment group are higher than that in the control group, and in individuals with severe lung damage, these indices are similar to that of the control group. These abnormal respiratory conditions related to variable lung damage in mice demonstrate that the respiration is synchronously influenced by inhalable Cd and respiratory compensation according to normal physiological regulation, suggesting the present method is effective.

AB The bulk depositions of trace metals to three land uses in the Yangtze River Delta are investigated based on the collected 154 precipitation samples from August 2015 to May 2017. The volume-weighted mean (VWM) concentrations of Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb were 13.28, 5.32, 13.02, 0.33, and 10.53 mu g L-1, and 12%, 16%, 3%, 11%, and 26% of precipitation events exceeded the limits in the Central Drinking-Water Source Area (GB3838-2002), respectively. Furthermore, the five metals varied significantly under urban, industrial, and rural land use conditions, indicating that these metal concentrations were greatly determined by local sources; lower concentrations were found in sea and local air masses than in air masses from inland trajectories. Combining the precipitation amounts, the bulk deposition fluxes of the five metals were 25.99, 25.47, 20.60, 10.40, 0.64 mg m(-2) yr(-1). By comparing the metal deposition fluxes in 98 studies across China, Ni and Pb deposition in the Yangtze River Delta was higher, while that of Cd and Zn was lower than their respective averages across China, indicating that Ni and Pb pollution should receive more attention in the study area.
   Capsule: Bulk/wet deposition fluxes of trace metals varied greatly among rural, industrial, and urban areas, and Pb and Ni showed severe pollution levels in the Yangtze River Delta.

AB Fate modelling of artificial radionuclides (ARs) in top soils are necessary to assess the radiological effects to population. Among ARs, Cs-137, Sr-90 and I-131 are very important since the large abundances in the environment. In this study, the fates of Cs-137, Sr-90 and I-131 in the surface soil layers were simulated by the soil model which was developed by the Canadian Centre for Environmental Modelling and Chemistry (CEMC). The scenario that Cs-137, Sr-90 and I-131 contaminated in topsoil in the exclusion of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (NPP) accident was evaluated. The results show the expected time for the minimum hazardous level of exposure. It is 115.5 days after the exposure, when the total effective dose is 1 mSv y(-1) in which 0.46 mSv y(-1) from ingestion and 0.54 mSv y(-1) from gamma exposure. Hazard levels due to exposure progresses are varied in order gamma exposure (82.14%) > ingestion (17.47%) > inhalation (0.39%). The hazard levels from radionuclides are varied in order Cs-137 (63.34%) > I-131 (33.48%) > Sr-90 (3.18%).

AB Cruise ship wastewater discharges are pollution sources towards the marine environment that are poorly characterized. In this study, wastewater samples from cruise ships have been obtained during repair works in a shipyard. Different organic pollutants have been analyzed and their concentrations were similar to those in urban wastewaters for pharmaceuticals and fragrances, but higher for UV filters and PAHs. For the first time, cypermethrin, a pesticide highly toxic towards aquatic species, was found at relevant concentrations (> 1 mu g L boolean AND-1). The faecal microorganisms were for all parameters higher than 10 boolean AND 4 CFU 100 mL boolean AND(-)1, which together with the presence of antibiotic compounds in wastewater (e.g., triclosan), could potentially lead to the generation of antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB). The historical position of cruise ships, determined from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), were used to define the time ships were underway, at port, or in repair. From ship's passenger and crew load, and from estimates of discharges the total volume of wastewater produced by these ships (371,000 m boolean AND 3 year boolean AND-1) and the average flow (0.15 +/- 0.03 m boolean AND 3crew boolean AND-1 day boolean AND-1) were calculated.

AB PM2.5 has implications in cardiovascular adverse events, but the underlying mechanisms are still obscure. The aim of this study is to evaluate miRNA expression in endothelial cells in response to two realistic doses of PM2.5 and to identify the possible gene targets of deregulated miRNAs through microarray profiling and computational technology. As a result, there are 18 differentially expressed miRNAs between 2.5 mu g/cm(2) group and the control, of which 11 miRNAs are up-regulated and 7 miRNAs are down-regulated. Relative to the control group, 40 miRNAs are significantly changed in 10 mu g/cm(2) group with 21 miRNAs being upregulated and 19 miRNAs being downregulated. Interestingly, when two PM2.5-treated groups respectively compared with the control, the expressed trends of 12 miRNAs in 2.5 mu g/cm(2) group are the same as those in 10 mu g/cm(2) group, with 8 being upregulated and 4 miRNAs being simultaneously downregulated. Gene ontology (GO) analysis shows that the crucial functional categories of miRNA-targeted genes incorporate transcription-related process and intracellular signal transduction. Pathway analysis reveals that endocytosis, FoxO signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway are involved in the PM2.5-caused cardiotoxicity. Further confirmation by RT-qPCR indicates that PM2.5 could induce the down-regulation of hsa-miR-128-3p, hsa-miR-96-5p, hsa-miR-28-5p, hsa-miR-4478 and hsa-miR-6808-5p, which are in accordance with the results of array data. With the comprehensive analysis of mRNAs and miRNAs, a great number of pairs have been identified, suggesting abnormally expressed miRNAs have functions in the cardiotoxicity of PM2.5, and the function may be achieved through the post-transcriptional regulation of certain genes on the related pathways.

AB Interspecific differences in arsenic bioaccumulation and organ distribution (muscle, liver, kidney and gills) in three predator fish (creole perch, rainbow trout and brown trout) from a Patagonian lake impacted by volcanic eruptions were studied. Arsenic in fish organs were compared analyzing: 1) temporal (before and after volcanic eruption) and spatial (near and far from the volcano) influence of Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcanic complex activity on arsenic concentrations; 2) the influence of growth (as total length), organ type and their interactions over arsenic accumulation; and 3) arsenic speciation and total arsenic relationship with carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N), as a proxy of lipid presence, in fish muscle. In general, total arsenic concentrations in creole perch organs were 2-7 times higher than those recorded in the corresponding organs of salmonids. Arsenic was preferentially accumulated in liver and kidney in the three fish species. The influence of the volcanic activity over arsenic concentrations was more evident in creole perch: organs from creole perch captured closest to the volcano exhibited higher arsenic concentrations. Temporal variations were not so consistent. No clear relationship between arsenic and fish length was observed. Positive and linear relationship between arsenic in all pair of organs was found in creole perch, while rainbow trout showed a quadratic relationship between muscle and the remaining organs, indicating different arsenic assimilation-elimination relationships between organs and fish. The arsenic liver:muscle ratio in the three fish species was greater than 1, suggesting some level of arsenic stress. Arsenobetaine (AB) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) were the dominant arsenic species in muscle of these fish, having creole perch 3-4 times higher AB than rainbow trout. A positive relationship between C:N ratio and total arsenic concentrations was found, with higher C:N in creole perchs near the volcano. In terms of food safety, no inorganic arsenic compound were detected, therefore arsenic levels in fish from Lake Nahuel Huapi does not represent any health risk to consumers.

AB Bacteria are ubiquitous in the near-surface atmosphere where they constitute an important component of aerosols with the potential to affect climate change, ecosystems, atmospheric process and human health. Limitation in tracking bacterial diversity accurately has thus far prevented the knowledge of airborne bacteria and their pathogenic properties. We performed a comprehensive assessment of bacterial abundance and diverse community in PM2.5 collected at Mt. Tai, via high-throughput sequencing and real-time PCR. The samples exhibited a high microbial biodiversity and complex chemical composition. The dominating populations were gram-negative bacteria including Burkholderia, Delftia, Bradyrhizobium, and Methylobacterium. The PM mass concentration, chemical composition, bacterial concentration and community structure varied under the influence of different air-mass trajectories. The highest mass concentration of PM2.5 (61 mu g m(-3)) and major chemical components were recorded during periods when marine southeasterly air masses were dominant. The local terrestrial air masses from Shandong peninsula and its adjacent areas harbored highest bacterial concentration loading (602 cells m(-3)) and more potential pathogens at the site. In contrast, samples influenced by the longdistance air flow from Siberia and Outer Mongolia were found to have a highest richness and diversity as an average, which was also marked by the increase of dust-associated bacteria (Brevibacillus and Staphylococcus). The primary research may serve as an important reference for the environmental microbiologist, health workers, and city planners.

AB In this study, using a natural and green protein R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) extracted from marine Porphyra yezoensis as the stabilizer and reducer, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized. Based on this, a highly sensitive and selective method for the detection of Cu2+ ions was developed using R-PE-AgNPs as fluorescent probe. The interactions between R-PE-AgNPs and Cu2+ ions were systematically characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), elemental mapping and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). It was found that Cu2+ ions could cause aggregation of the R-PE-AgNPs, accompanied by the greatly increased particle size. Importantly, the method offered a wide linear detection range from 0 mu M to 100.0 mu M with a detection limit of 0.0190 mu M. Moreover, the proposed method was successfully applied to analyze Cu2+ ions in tap water and lake water samples, acquiring satisfactory recovery between 91.6% and 102.2%. Such a green, fast and cost-effective fluorimetric method of the R-PE-AgNPs probe has great potential for tracing Cu2+ ions in diverse aqueous media.

AB Under the Stockholm Convention, signatory countries are obliged to direct source inventories, find current sources, and provide ecological monitoring evidence to guarantee that the encompassing levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are declining. However, such monitoring of different types of POPs are to a great degree constrained in most developing countries including Nepal and are primarily confined to suspected source area/ densely populated regions. In this study, 9 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 2 dechlorane plus (DPs), 6 novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) and 8 organophosphate ester flame retardants (OPFRs) were investigated in indoor dust from a rural area (Kopawa) in Nepal in order to evaluate their occurrence/level, profile, spatial distribution and their sources. Additionally, health risk exposure was estimated to anticipate the possible health risk to the local population. The results showed that OPFRs was the most abundant FR measured in the dust. The concentration of Sigma(8)OPFRs was about 2, 3 and 4 orders of magnitude higher than the Sigma(6)NBFRs, Sigma 9PBDEs, and Sigma(2)DPs, respectively. Tris (methylphenyl) phosphate (TMPP) and Tris (2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP) were the most abundant OPFRs analyzed in the dust; while decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) exceeded among NBFRs. Likewise, 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'-decabromodiphenylether (BDE-209) was the most identified chemical among PBDEs. The total organic carbon (TOC) content in dust was significantly and positively connected with octa-BDEs (Rho = 0.615, p < 0.01), BTBPE (Rho = 0.733, p < 0.01), TPHP (Rho = 0.621, p < 0.01), TEHP (Rho = 0.560, p < 0.01) and TMPPs (Rho = 0.550, p < 0.01), while black carbon (BC) was either weakly related or not related, suggesting little or no impact of BC in the distribution of FRs. Principal component analysis indicated the contribution from commercial penta-, octa- and deca-BDEs formulation, the adhesive substance, food packaging and paints, and degradation of BDE-209 as the essential sources of FRs. Health risk exposure estimates showed that dermal absorption via dust as the primary route of FRs intake. The estimated daily exposure of PBDEs, NBFRs and OPFRs were 2-10 orders of magnitude lower than their corresponding reference dose (RfD), suggesting insignificant risk. However, other routes such as inhalation and dietary intake might still be significant in the case of Kopawa which should be tested in future.

AB Cadmium (Cd) induces cell death in plant roots. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays a role in the regulation of cell death induced by Cd in plant roots. In this study, MhMAPK4 was isolated from the roots of Malus hupehensis. Subcellular localization showed that the MhMAPK4 protein was located in the cell membrane and cytoplasm and is a transmembrane protein that is characterized by hydrophily. The expression of MhMAPK4 in the roots of M. hupehensis was up-regulated by Cd sulfate and Cd chloride. Phenotypic comparison under Cd stress showed that the growth of wild-type (WT) tobacco was lower than the transgenic lines overexpressing MhMAPK4. The fresh weight and the root length of WT also was lower than that of the transgenic tobacco. The net Cd2+ influx in the tobacco roots was decreased by the overexpression of MhMAPK4, as was root Cd accumulation. The recovery time of the Cd2+ influx to stable state in the transgenic tobacco was also shorter than the WT. The expression of iron-regulated transporter 1 (NtIRT1) and natural resistance associated macrophage protein 5 (NtNRAMP5) was relatively low in the transgenic lines under Cd stress. Cell death and apoptosis in the tobacco roots was reduced following the overexpression of MhMAPK4. The activity of vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE) and the transcript level of VPE in the transgenic tobacco was lower than that of WT under Cd stress. In addition, the electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide contents in the transgenic tobacco were lower than those of WT, whereas the antioxidant enzyme activity and expression were higher. These results suggest that MhMAPK4 regulates Cd accumulation by mediating Cd2+ uptake by the roots, and controls Cd-caused cell death by adjusting VPE activity.

AB The composition, distribution, indexes and budget of saturated lipid biomarker aliphatic hydrocarbons (AHs) in sediments of the East China Sea (ESC) were analyzed to identify their indications and sources. The resolved n-alkane (R) contents were 0.70-2.89 mu g/g, with long-chain n-alkanes as the dominant composition in the ECS. The high R values mainly appeared at south inner shelf and north outer upwelling area, corresponding to the high mud, total organic carbon (TOC) and Chl a contents there. The composition, distribution pattern, combined with indexes of AHs, suggested no petroleum contamination and predominant biogenic sources in the ECS. The biogenic sources mainly were the mixed terrestrial higher plant, marine plankton and bacteria and aquatic macrophyte origins. Biotic source apportionment suggested that terrestrial higher plants were the dominant source of AHs, followed by marine planktons, with the lowest of submerged/floating macrophytes. Quantitative evaluation of R sources suggested that the Changjiang River input was the primary terrestrial contributor, accounting for 67.9% of total terrestrial input. The burial flux of R was 1.11 x 10(3) t/yr, with inner shelf and estuary as main accumulation areas. Although there was a huge amount of R influx from terrestrial and marine sources, only 9.8% could be preserved in sediments.

AB Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widespread persistent organic pollutants (POPs) because of their extensive use in diverse electronic products, which have posed great threats to human health and ecosystem. In this study, a total of 54 soil samples were collected from an e-waste recycling area in Tianjin, northern China for analyzing the occurrence and distribution of 14 PBDE congeners. The concentrations of BDE 209, Sigma 13PBDEs and E14PBDEs in the soils from Ziya e-waste recycling area were 2.9-2666 ng/g dw (dry weight) (average 90 ng/g dw), 3.0-41 ng/g dw (average 13 ng/g dw) and 5.9-2699 ng/g dw (average 103 ng/g dw), respectively. The Sigma 14PBDEs concentration showed a dramatic decrease from the central area to the surrounding area. Generally, PBDEs in the northern part showed higher levels than the southern part of the e-waste recycling area due to the wind direction in Tianjin. Deep soil was less polluted by PBDEs, which largely comes from the deposition, migration and infiltration of PBDEs in the surface soils. Overall, PBDEs level in the studied area was much lower than some typical e-waste recycling areas in south China, such as Guiyu and Qingyuan, but significantly higher than the non-e-waste recycling areas. BDE 209, BDE 138 and BDE 28 were the three dominant PBDE congeners in the soil. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the commercial penta-BDEs and deca-BDE could be considered as the main sources of PBDEs pollution in this region. Redundancy analysis (RDA) suggested that the local PBDEs sources rather than soil properties influenced the PBDEs distribution in Ziya e-waste recycling area. This study systematically revealed the occurrence and distribution of PBDEs in soils from the biggest established circular economy park in northern China.

AB Virgin queens (gynes) exhibit a range of behaviors in order to be accepted as the leader of colony. However, environmental neurotoxic insecticides as neonicotinoids may affect the social performance of the bees. Here, we evaluated the sublethal effects of neonicotinoid imidacloprid on the larval food of queens from Plebeia droryana, a species of neotropical stingless bee. Several behaviors were analyzed as multivariate response variables in a Hotelling test, as well as generalized additive mixed models. Our findings demonstrate that treated queens perform less wing vibration and trophallaxis with their workers. Furthermore, the treated gynes encounter more harassment (aggression) from their workers, suggesting that workers can differentiate nontreated queens from treated queens most likely by chemical signals. Our data indicate that the behavioral repertoire underlying the queen selection process by the stingless bee P. droryana may be seriously affected by residual doses of imidacloprid in larval food. As a result, such queens are rather undernourished and aggressed by workers, which most likely compromises the viability and permanence of colonies in the long term.

AB Ionic rare earth mining is of strategic importance in China; however, the heavy metal pollution it causes is of great concern, both at home and abroad. Data on Pb speciation at a rare earth mine were used to analyse the migration capacity of Pb during the process of ore leaching. The major factors thought to influence the migration capacity of Pb, including the clay mineral content, soil pH, oxidation-reduction potential, organic matter content, and cation exchange capacity (CEC), were quantified. Entropy and fuzzy clustering methods were used to identify the most predictive factors. The results showed that the clay mineral content of the soil exerts the strongest influence on the migration capacity of Pb in rare earth mines; the other factors demonstrated relatively weak influences on the transport processes. The results obtained from the classification of Pb per the potential migration index (PMI) approximated those obtained from fuzzy clustering, and the results of entropy analyses were consistent with those of fuzzy clustering. Thus, the methods upon which the proposed model is based are suitable for predicting the migration capacity of Pb in ore during the mining of ionic rare earth minerals.

AB Residue of veterinary antibiotics (VAs) in the animal breeding industry has become a problematic environmental issue. However, the residual levels of VAs as well as their variation tendency, degradation mechanisms and relationships with other parameters during animal wastewater disposal processes are still obscure. This study measured different samples during wastewater disposal processes from three farms, and systematically analyzed the residue, migration and removal of 58 kinds of typical VAs (6 classes) in Tianjin, China. The results showed that about 44 kinds of VAs were quantitatively detected. Tetracycline antibiotics (TCs) usually had higher residual concentrations than other classes of VAs in the raw wastewater; the highest residual concentration was 130.67 +/- 5.90 mu g/L which occurred for chlortetracycline (CTC). Pig farms generally had more VAs species and higher residual concentrations than dairy farms, and the proportion of different VAs was similar for dairy farms. The final removal rates of different VAs classes varied largely (negative to > 99.87%), and the highest removal rates usually occurred in biological processes for adsorption and biodegradation effects, and occasionally occurred in the final effluents. The correlation coefficients between VAs removal rates and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rates were much higher than those of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) in pig farms, while opposite conclusion was obtained in dairy farms. Among different classes, TCs presented the highest daily mass loading of ND similar to 10,453.8 +/- 471.7 mg/d in the influent and ND similar to 1141.6 +/- 58.9 mg/d in the effluent in farm 1.

AB Exposure to ionizing radiation is harmful to any living organism. It may cause varying levels of genetic mutation or ultimately death. Synthetic compounds have been used to counteract the hazardous effect of radiation on the live cells, but the possibility of these synthetic compounds being harmful to the organism being treated also exists. Herbal formulations are thus being explored as a possible alternative for the synthetic radioprotectant. Induction of DNA damage in fishes caused by ionizing radiation and its protection by phytocompounds is a hardly studied topic. In this study, we analyzed the radioprotective effect of Gymnema sylvestre leaves extract (GS) and its active compound gymnemagenin (GG) against different doses of gamma radiation (Co-60) on the freshwater fish Pangasius sutchi. The radioprotective efficacy was assessed by micronuclei and alkaline comet assays. The freshwater fish P. sutchi was pre-treated with intramuscular injection (IM) of amifostine (83.3 mg/kg of BM.), GS (25 mg/kg of B.W.) and GG (0.3 mg/kg of BM.), 1 h prior to the gamma radiation. The fishes were exposed to LD30, LD50 and LD70 of gamma radiation and the protection activities were assessed by analyzing the number of micronuclei (MN) and erythrocytic abnormalities in the blood after 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 days after exposure. Compared to the irradiated fishes, frequency of erythrocytic abnormalities were decreased in response to the radio-protection in the amifostine treated groups for all three doses of gamma radiation (LD70-77.62%), (LD55-80.11%) and (LD30-82.30%); GS (LD70-62.66%), (LD50-69.74%) and (LD30-70.81%); and GG (LD70- 49.42%), (LD50-53.43%) and (LD30-58.42%). Similarly, a significant radio-protective effect in terms of decremented DNA damage was observed using the comet assay after post exposure. The percentage of protection noted for amifostine was (LD70-58.68%), (LD50-64.52%) and (LD30-74.40%); GS (LD70-53.84%), (LD50-59.02%) and (LD30-65.97%); GG (LD70-49.85%), (LD50-52.56%) and (LD30-64.30%). From the current study, we can conclude that the radioprotective efficacy of the GS is similar to the synthetic compound (amifostine) and also greater than the bioactive compound (GG). The synergetic effect of the plant extract which leads to a better protection than the bioactive compound must be further studied. MN and Comet assays can easily identify the damage due to radiation exposure and thus can be used as predictive biomarkers for aquatic organisms exposed to radiation.

AB Antimony, one of the heavier pnictogens, is widely used in industry, and its toxicity has become a major concern. Although previous studies suggested that antimony might be a tumorigenic risk factor in several cancers, the molecular basis underlying antimony-mediated transformation remains unclear. Our results showed that the serum concentration of antimony was higher in prostate cancer specimens relative to that of benign prostate tissues, and this high serum concentration of antimony was closely associated with poorer outcome in prostate cancer patients. Additionally, we demonstrated that antimony could promote prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In order to gain insight into the potential mechanisms, we examined the effects of antimony exposure on downstream signaling that could contribute to tumor development. We found that low-dose antimony could regulate the expression of Ctbp2 by binding and regulating the activity of its MRE domain. Meanwhile, CtBP2 could transcriptionally regulate the expression of RhoC, which is a member of the RhoGTPase family. Subsequently, the kinase activity of ROCK1 is increased, which promotes the stability of oncogene c-Myc. Overall, our study demonstrated that antimony could enhance c-Myc protein stability and promote prostate cancer cell proliferation through activating CtBP2-ROCK1 signaling pathway. These findings also substantially highlighted the potential of targeting molecules within antimony induced CtBP2-c-Myc signaling pathway as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of prostate cancer.

AB A total of 167 samples of agricultural soil, atmospheric dust and food crops (wheat and maize) were collected, and four heavy metals, including Zn, Cu, Ni, and Cr, were analyzed for their concentrations, pollution levels and human health risks. The mean heavy metal contents in the agricultural soil and atmospheric dust were exceeds background values and lower than their IEQS (Iranian Environmental Quality Standard) with an exception of Ni. A pollution assessment by Geo-accumulation Index (I-geo) showed that the pollution levels were in the order of Ni > Cu > Cr > Zn for agricultural soils and Ni > Cu > Zn > Cr for atmospheric dust. The Ni levels can be considered "moderately to heavily contaminated" status. The human health risk assessment indicated that non-carcinogenic values were below the threshold values (1), and main exposure pathway of heavy metals to both children and adults are ingestion. The carcinogenic risks values for Ni and Cr were higher than the safe value (1 x 10(-6)), suggesting that all receptors (especially wheat) in Kermanshah province might have significant and acceptable potential health risk because of exposure to Ni and Cr. The carcinogenic risk for children and adults has a descending order of Ni > Cr, except for wheat. These results provide basic information on heavy metal contamination control and human health risk assessment management in the Kermanshah province.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) usually co-exist in environment with interactional effects. Currently, Acinetobacter johnsonii was employed to degrade 400 mg L-1 of pyrene (PYR) and kinetic modeling indicated substrate inhibition over 76 mg L-1 by introducing an inhibition constant parameter. In PAHs co-biodegradation, naphthalene (NAP) dominated biodegradation processes through the preferential utilization as growth substrate. The peak biodegradation of PYR increased to 415 mg L-1 with 65 mg L-1 of NAP. Furthermore, phenanthrene (PHE), PYR and anthracene (ANT) were degraded in turn and ended in reverse order. When the concentrations reached their respective limiting concentration of 22%, ANT could not be degraded and PHE and PYR biodegradations also respectively terminated at 66 and 45 h later with a removal rate of 40% and 26% due to very low specific activities of salicylate hydroxylase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase. However, by introducing 125-133 mg L(-1 )of NAP, the bacterial potential was effectively enhanced to 29% after cell underwent a re-stimulation stage with the exhaustion of NAP. NAP prominently contributed to cell growth to stimulate secretion of key enzymes, but the advantage would gradually get lost with the decline of its titer. To research the interplay of PAHs is conducive to targeted decontamination.

AB The implementation of ecologically relevant sub-lethal endpoints in toxicity testing with freshwater mussels can provide valuable information during risk assessment, especially since these organisms are often exposed to low levels of contaminants. This study examined how to optimize quantifying the filtering capacity or clearance rate (CR) of mussels after exposure to a reference toxicant, sodium chloride (NaCl). CR was defined as the number of algal cells an individual mussel can remove from the overlying water by filtration over time and was determined using spectrophotometric absorbance and direct microscopic examination. Optimization included consideration of the following factors: concentration of algae mixture at test initiation, duration of CR assay, and statistical power. Experimental vessels contained either juvenile (ten, similar to 4 months old) or adult (one, similar to 2.5 years old) Lampsilis siliquoidea. To detect a 10% change in filtering capacity, the optimized adult CR assay was run for 48 h with 2.7 x 10(7) cells/mL of algae added at test initiation and a minimum of 6 replicates per treatment. The optimized juvenile mussel CR assay was run for 48 h with 1.77 x 10(7 )cells/mL of algae added at test initiation; however, 13 replicates would be required to detect a 10% change to satisfy each method. To reduce the number of juvenile mussels used in testing, a minimum of 4 replicates per treatment was recommended to detect a 25% change in CR. After exposure to a reference toxicant (NaCl), EC(50)s from the optimized CR assay were compared to two other mussel toxicity endpoints: survival and burial (ability of mussels to bury in clean sand). CR by direct microscopic examination was slightly more sensitive than survival and burial in juveniles and only slightly more sensitive than survival in adults. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were detected between the EC/LC50 values determined from CR and the less labour-intensive survival and burial endpoints. The present study suggests the CR for juvenile and adult L. siliquoidea remained largely unaffected in mussels that survived a 7-day NaCl exposure.

AB Mining activities promote the development of economies and societies, yet they cause environmental impacts that must be minimized so that their benefits overcome the likely risks. This study evaluated eco-friendly technologies based on the use of low-carbon footprint wastes and industrial by-products as soil amendments for the revegetation of Zn-mining areas. Our goal was to select adequate soil amendments that can be used to recover these areas, with a focus on low-cost materials. The amendments - limestone, sewage sludge, biochar, and composted food remains - were first characterized concerning their chemical composition and structural morphologies. Soil samples (Entisol, Oxisol, Technosol) from three different areas located inside an open-pit mine were later incubated for 60 days with increasing doses of each soil amendment, followed by cultivation with Andropogon gayanus, a native species. The amendments were able to change not only soil pH, but also the phytoavailable levels of Cd, Zn, and Pb. Limestone and biochar were the amendments that caused the highest pH values, reducing the phytoavailability of the metals. All amendments improved seed germination; however, the composted food remains presented low levels of germination, which could make the amendments unfeasible for revegetation efforts. Our findings showed that biochar, which is a by-product of the mining company, is the most suitable amendment to enhance revegetation efforts in the Zn-mining areas, not only because of its efficiency and cost, but also due to its low carbon footprint, which is currently the trend for any "green remediation" proposal.

AB Petroleum can pollute pristine shorelines as a consequence of accidental spills or chronic leaks. In this study, the fate of petroleum hydrocarbons in soft pristine sediment of Caleta Valdes (Argentina) subject to ex situ simulated oil pollution was assessed. Sedimentary columns were exposed to medium and high concentrations of Escalante Crude Oil (ECO) and incubated in the laboratory during 30 days. Levels of aliphatic hydrocarbons at different depths of the sedimentary column were determined by gas chromatography. Oil penetration was limited to the first three centimetres in both treatments, and under this depth, hydrocarbons were clearly biogenic (terrestrial plants) as in the whole sedimentary column of the control assay. Bioturbation by macrobenthic infauna was strongly impacted by oil pollution which resulted in reduced sediment oxygenation and low burial of petroleum hydrocarbons. This may partly explain the limited hydrocarbon biodegradation observed, as indicated by the relatively high values of the ratios nC17/pristane, nC18/phytane, and total resolved aliphatic hydrocarbons/ unresolved complex mixture. Correspondingly, at the end of the experiment the most probable number of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria reached similar to 10(3 )MPN g(-1)dry weight. These values were lower than those found in chronically polluted coastal sediments, reflecting a low activity level of the oil-degrading community. The results highlight the low attenuation capacities of Caleta Valdes pristine sediments to recover its original characteristics in a short time period if an oil spill occurs. In this work, we present a novel and integrative tool to evaluate the fate of petroleum hydrocarbons and their potential damage on pristine sediments.

AB Phytoremediation is regarded as one of the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly strategies for potentially toxical metals (PTMs) contaminated soil remediation. Despite that, continuous studies are conducting to explore the potential plant species in order to achieve enhanced remediation efficiencies. Therefore, in this study, a field investigation was conducted to screen the potential phytoremediation plants from a contaminated site in the surrounding area of a Zn smelter in Feng Country, China. Results indicated that soils in the studied area were severely contaminated with Cd and Zn, while the contents of other metals (Cu, Pb, and Ni) were below the allowanced threshold. Moreover, the contamination was more serious in areas closer to the smelter. The elevated level of contamination had great impacts on plant diversity and abundance. Fifty-nine plant species belonging to 28 families were identified in the studied area, of which plants from the Asteraceae family and herbs were most frequently observed. Plants demonstrated differentiated potential on metal accumulation and translocation, and the total Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn contents in the aerial parts of plants ranged from 5.57 to 268.5, 14.34 to 140.90, 10.43 to 570.3, and 110.3 to 1350 mg kg(-1) , respectively. Symphytum officinale Linn. distinguished itself from the various plants as a promising plant candidate for soil remediation, due to its great capacities for absorbing Cd, Pb, and Zn. Specifically, an individual Symphytum officinale Linn. plant can accumulate up to 5.54, 21.0, and 52.9 mg Cd, Pb, and Zn in its aboveground parts (20.67 g dry weight). Results from this study can provide a reference for the phytoremediation of PTMs contaminated soil in this area or other places with similar soil and climate conditions.

AB This study aimed to verify whether Olea europaea L. (olive) oil (OEO) exerted a protective effect against oxidative stress induced by deltamethrin (DM) and alterations of pituitary, thyroid and gonadal hormones in adult female rats. DM (0,00256 g/kg body weight), OEO (0,6 g/kg body weight) and DM with OEO were administered to rats orally for 28 days. Volatile compounds present in olive oil were analysed by GC-MS. Estradiol (E-2), Thyroxine (T4),Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Triiodothyronine (T3), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Progesterone (Pg) were measured in serum using Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA). Lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyls (PCs), reduced glutathione (GSH) levels along with superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were determined in thyroid and ovarian tissues. Sesquiterpenes, (E,E)-alpha-farnesene (16.45%) and alpha-copaene (9,86%), were analysed as the main volatile compounds of OEO. The relative weight of ovaries and thyroid and body weight significantly decreased in rats treated with DM. DM caused significant alterations in TSH, T4, FSH, Pg and E-2 levels while T3 and LH concentrations remained unchanged when compared to control. DM also increased significantly LPO and PCs levels. In addition, GSH reserves as well as CAT, GPx, SOD and GST activities were suppressed in DM-received rats. The presence of OEO with DM returned the levels of oxidative stress markers, thyroid and reproductive hormones at the control values. Our results indicate that OEO is a powerful agent able to protect against DM oxidative stress and endocrine changes.

AB Since 2010, Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor has been restricted and replaced by analogues like Bisphenol S (BPS). However, little is known about BPS effects and growing concern have suspected the "BPA-free" Label. Several recent studies suggest that BPS is associated with increased risk of diabetes and obesity. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unidentified. The current study investigates investigate BPS effects on hypothalamic neuropeptides regulating feeding behavior, either orexigenic or anorexigenic in Swiss Albino mice. We also studied the effect of BPS on the apelinergic system (apelin/apelin receptor (APJ)) as an original physiological system with pleiotropic actions.
   Bisphenol S at 25, 50, 100 mu g/kg was administered to mice in water drink for 10 weeks started after weaning. Our results showed that BPS exposure alters orexigenic hypothalamic neuropeptide (AgRP) regulating feeding behavior but not anorexigenic neuropeptides (POMC, CART). Such orexigenic alterations may underlay appetite disorders leading to a concomitant food intake and body weight gain increase. In addition, data show that BPS affects the hypothalamic apelinergic system. We found a significant decrease in APJ mRNA but not in apelin expression. Based on hypothalamic APJ distribution, we suggested a potent specific physiological alteration of this receptor in mediating neuroendocrine responses in hypothalamus.
   Thus, our findings provide that BPS exposure could contribute to the development of obesity and metabolic disorders.

AB Depleting aquifers, lack of planning and low socioeconomic status of Pakistani farmers have led them to use wastewater (WW) for irrigating their crops causing food contamination with heavy metals and ultimately negative effects on human health. This study evaluates the effects of chitosan (CH) and biochar (BC) on growth and nutritional quality of brinjal plant together with in situ immobilization of heavy metals in a soil polluted with heavy metals due to irrigation with wastewater (SPHIW) and further irrigated with the same WW. Both CH and BC were applied at three different rates i.e. low rate [(LR), BC0.5%, CH0.5% and BC0.25% + CH0.25%], medium rate [(MR), BC1%, CH1% and BC0.5%+ CH0.5%] and high rate [(HR), BC1.5%, CH1.5% and BC0.75% + CH0.75%]. Result revealed that brinjal growth, antioxidant enzymes, and fruit nutritional quality significantly improved from LR to HR for each amendment, relative to control. However, these results were more prominent with BC alone and BC + CH, compared with CH alone at each rate. Similarly, with few exceptions, significant reduction in Ni, Cd, Co, Cr and Pb concentrations in the root, shoot and fruit were found in sole CH treatment both at LR and MR but in both CH and BC + CH treatments at HR, relative to control. Interestingly, the concentrations of Fe in the roots, shoots and fruit were more pronounced at BC treatments relative to CH and BC + CH treatments at each rate, compared to control. Overall, the BC + CH treatment at HR was the most effective treatment for in situ immobilization of heavy metals in SPHIW and further irrigated with the same WW, compared to rest of the treatments. This study indicates that BC0.75% + CH0.75% treatment can be used to reduce mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals in SPHIW and facilitates plant growth by improving the antioxidant system. However, the feasibility of BC0.75% + CH0.75% treatment should also be tested at the field scale.

AB The distribution characteristics of Cadmium (Cd) fractions in soils around a coal mining area of Huaibei coalfield were investigated, with the aim to assess its ecological risk. The total Cd concentrations in soils ranged from 0.05 to 0.87 mg/kg. The high percentage of phyto-available Cd (58%) when redox or base-acid equilibria changed. Soil pH was found to be a crucial factor affecting soil Cd fraction, and carbonate-bound Cd can be significantly affected by both organic matter and pH of soils. The static ecological evaluation models, including potential ecological risk index (PERI), geo-accumulation index (60) and risk assessment code (RAC), revealed a moderate soil Cd contamination and prensented high Cd exposure risk in studied soils. However, the dynamic evaluation of Cd risk, determined using a delayed geochemical hazard (DGH), suggested that our studied soils can be classified as median-risk with a mean probability of 24.79% for Cd DGH. These results provide a better assessment for the risk development of Cd contamination in coal mining areas.

AB As a source of edible oil and protein, soybean is a major globally important economic crop; Improving its production has been an important objective of soybean breeding. Acid rain has been shown to influence soybean growth and productivity, with consequent adverse impacts on its production for use by human populations. In this study, RNA sequencing technology was utilized to examine changes in gene expression when soybean was exposed to simulated acid rain (SAR). We sampled soybean leaves at five time intervals (0, 6, 30, 54, 78, and 102 h), and built the cDNA library. In total, 54,175 expression genes were found, including 2016 genes with differential expression. A total of 416 genes were considered, as they were closely related to the response to SAR. Genes related to the regulation of sulfur and nitrogen metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis, and reactive oxygen species were among those differentially expressed in response to SAR. In this study, we examined the response mechanisms of soybean under SAR exposure. Our findings will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms employed by soybean in responding to abiotic stress, and therefore provides important information in developing soybean breeding to improve tolerance to these stresses.

AB Air pollution worldwide, especially in China and India, has caused serious health issues. Because PM2.5 particles consist of solid particles of diverse properties with payloads of inorganic, organic and biological pollutants, it is still not known what the major toxic components are and how these components induce toxicities. To explore this complex issue, we apply reductionism principle and an ultrafine particle library approach in this work. From investigation of 63 diversely functionalized ultrafine particles (FUPs) with adsorbed key pollutants, our findings indicate that 1) only certain pollutants in the payloads of PM2.5 are responsible for causing cellular oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, and cytotoxicity while the particle carriers are much less toxic; 2) pollutant-induced cellular oxidative stress and oxidative stress-triggered apoptosis are identified as one of the dominant mechanisms for PM2.5-induced cytotoxicity; 3) each specific toxic component on PM2.5 (such as As, Pb, Cr or BaP) mainly affects its specific target organ(s) and, adding together, these pollutants may cause synergistic or just additive effects. Our findings demonstrate that reductionism concept and model PM2.5 particle library approach are very effective in our endeavor to search for a better understanding of PM2.5-induced health effects.

AB Thirteen antibiotics including sulfonamides (SAs), tetracyclines (TETs) and fluoroquinolones (FQs) were measured in Hanjiang River (HR) during two periods. The total concentrations of 13 antibiotics in surface water and sediments ranged from 3.1 to 109 ng/l and from 10 to 45 ng/g dry weight, respectively. SAs were dominant in water while the concentrations of TETs were the highest in sediments in two seasons. For their spatial distribution, total concentrations of 13 antibiotics in both matrices were significantly higher in the lower section of HR (p < 0.02, F > 5.15) due to wastewater release, agricultural activities and water transfer project. Obvious seasonal variations of sulfadiazine, sulfameter, trimethoprim and oxytetracycline in water were observed (p < 0.05, F > 4.62). Phase partition of antibiotics between water and sediments suggested a greater affinity of TETs and FQs to sediments. In addition, significantly positive relationships were found between SAs (sulfameter, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) and sediment TOC (p < 0.05). Risk assessment indicated that the hazard quotients of antibiotics were higher in the sediment than those in the water. Moreover, antibiotic mixtures posed higher ecological risks to aquatic organisms.

AB In an effort to explore the detoxifying mechanisms of B. cereus RC-1 under heavy metal stress, the bioaccumulation by growing cells under varying range of pH, culture time and initial metal concentration were investigated from a perspective of cation release. The maximum removal efficiencies were 16.7%, 38.3%, 81.4% and 40.3% for Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+, respectively, with initial concentrations of 10 mg/L at pH 7.0. In presence of Cu2+ or Zn2+, large quantities of cations were released into the medium in descending order of Na+ > K+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ while bioremoval of the two essential metals Cd2+ and Pb2+ was accompanied with cellular Na+ and Mg2+ uptake from the medium' respectively. The relative mean contributions of intracellular accumulation to the total removal were approximately 19.6% for Cu2+, 12.8% for Zn2+, 51.1% for Cd2+, and only 4.6% for Pb2+. Following exposure at high concentration, B. cereus RC-1 could keep intracellular Cd2+ concentrations constant, possibly by means of a Cd-efflux system whose activity coincided with uptake of Na+, and reduce intracellular Pb2+ concentration due to the effect of Mg2+ on limiting Pb2+ access to the cells. Cellular morphology, surface functional groups and intracellular trace elements were further investigated by SEM-EDX, TEM-EDX, FTIR and ICP-MS analysis. The phenomena that removal of Cd2+ and Pb2+ coincided with uptake of Na2+ and Mg2+, respectively, inspires a novel research perspective towards the study of protective mechanism of bacterial cells against the toxicity of heavy metals.

AB Nine antialgal active compounds, (i.e. trehalose (1), twenty-two methyl carbonate (2), (-)-dihydromenisdaurilide (3), 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol (4), isophytol (5), 8-hexadecenol (6), 17-hydroxyheptadecanoic acid (7), trans-asarone (8) and 2-amino-3-mercaptopropanoic acid (9)) were isolated from Ulva pertusa for the first time by sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, silica gel column chromatography and repeated preparative TLC. Except for compound 4, all compounds represented novel isolated molecules from marine macroalgae. Further, antialgal activities of these compounds against Amphidiniwn carterae, Heterosigma akashiwo, Karenia mikimitoi, Phaeocystis globosa, Prorocentrum donghaiense and Skeletonema costamm were investigated for the first time. Results showed these nine compounds have selectivity antialgal effects on all test red tide microalgae, and antialgal activities against red tide microalgae obviously enhanced with the increase of concentration of antialgal compounds. Based on this, EC50-96 h values of these nine compounds for six red tide microalgae were obtained for the first time. By analyzing and comparing EC50-96 h values, it has been determined that seven compounds (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9) showed the superior application potential than potassium dichromate or gossonorol and other six compounds as a characteristic antialgal agent against Heterosigma akashiwo, Karenia mikimitoi and Prorocentrum donghaiense. Overall this study has suggested that green algae Ulva pertusa is a new source of bioactive compounds with antialgal activity.

AB SaNRAMP3 gene cloned from a Zn/Cd hyperaccumulator Sedum alfredii was ectopicly expressed in Brassica juncea, a fast-growing and high-biomass crop plant. In a tissue culture experiment, transgenic plants were grown on MS medium with 0, 25, 50, 100, 200 mu M Cd. It was shown that, at the same Cd treatment, the Cd tolerance of transgenic plants had no significant difference with those of wild-type plants (WT). However, the shoot Cd content and accumulation were improved significantly while the root Cd content and accumulation were descended significantly by SaNRAMP3 gene expression, which obviously enhanced the Cd root-to-shoot translocation factor (TF). In the hydroponic experiment, plants were cultured in nutrition solution with 0, 2.5, 25 mu M Cd. Data showed that the Cd tolerance of transgenic plants had no significant difference with that of WT under the same Cd exposure. Whereas, the shoot Cd content and accumulation was increased 1.43-1.81 times and the TF was enhanced 3.09-3.51 times by SaNRAMP3 gene expression. Those results indicated that ectopic expression of SaNRAMP3 in B. juncea didn't lead to Cd sensitivity, but enhanced Cd root-to-shoot transport, so that increased shoot Cd accumulation. This study provided a possibility to improve phytoextraction efficiency of heavy metal through gene engineering.

AB Harvesting whole-tree biomass for biofuel combustion intensifies removal of nutrients from the ecosystem. This can be partly amended by applying ash from the combustion back to the system and thus recycle the nutrients. However, besides being rich in inorganic nutrients, ash also contains trace amounts of heavy metals. Due to the risk of toxic effects and trophic transfer of heavy metals, especially cadmium, legislation usually restricts the use of ash as a soil amendment.
   In order to provide researchers and governmental agencies with a tool to assess the risk of cadmium bioaccumulation in specific soil systems after ash application, we review: 1) the properties of ash; 2) the chemical and toxic properties of cadmium; 3) the key factors affecting cadmium bioavailability, cadmium uptake-, storage and elimination-abilities in soil organisms and the risk of cadmium accumulation and biomagnification in the soil food web; 4) how ash impact on soil can change the risk of cadmium bioaccumulation.
   We conclude that for assessing the risk of cadmium bioaccumulation for specific sites, it is necessary to consider both the type and composition of ash, the soil conditions and organism composition on the site. On a general basis, we conclude that granulated ashes low in cadmium content, applied to low pH soils with high organic matter content, in systems with low abundances of earthworms, isopods and gastropods, will have a low risk of cadmium accumulation.

AB The using of bio-stimulant in plants grown under stress conditions for enhancing nutrition efficiency and crop quality traits is an effective approach. One of the bio-stimulants, humus material, is defined as humic acid (HA). HA application as a promotion of plant growth to plants grown in the heavy metals-contaminated soils has promised hope in terms of effects on plants but the its limiting effect is the application dose. Therefore, the wheat seedlings were grown in hydroponic culture for 21 d and the various concentrations of humic acid (HA; 750 or 1500 mg L-1) were treated alone or in combination with cadmium (Cd) stress (100 or 200 mu M) for 7 d. The results showed that after Cd stress treatment, water content (RWC), osmotic potential (psi(Pi)) and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters decreased and proline content (Pro) increased for 7 d. In spite of activated peroxidase (PDX) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), stress induced the toxic levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation. Cd stress triggered lipid peroxidation (TBARS content). HA application successfully eliminated the negative effects of stress on RWC, psi(Pi) and photosynthetic parameters. In the presence of HA under stress, the increased activation of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and NADPH-oxidase (NOX) enzymes and ascorbate, glutathione and GSH/GSSG ratio observed. Only 750 mg L-1 HA under stress conditions induced the activities of monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), and dehydroascorbate (DHA) content. After the combined application of HA and Cd stress, the low contents of H2O2 and TBARS maintained in wheat leaves. Hence, HA successfully eliminated the toxicity of Cd stress by modulating the water status, photosynthetic apparatus and antioxidant activity in wheat leaves.

AB Street dust samples from Durgapur, the steel city of eastern India, were collected from five different land use patterns, i.e., national highways, urban residential area, sensitive area, industrial area and busy traffic zone during summer, monsoon, and winter to analyze the pollution characteristics, chemical fractionation, source apportionment and health risk of heavy metals (HMs). The samples were fractionated into <= 53 mu M and analyzed for potentially harmful elements (PHEs) viz. Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Summer season indicated higher concentrations of PHEs when compared to the other two seasons. Mean enrichment factor (EF), geo-accumulation index (Igeo), and contamination factor (CF) were high for Cd followed by Pb during all the three season in Durgapur. Chemical fractionation was executed in order to obtain distribution patterns of PHEs and to evaluate their bioavailable fractions in street dust samples. Mn was found to be highly bioavailable and bioavailability of the PHEs were in the order of Mn > Zn > Pb > Ni > Cd > Cu > Fe > Cr. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), cluster analysis, correlation analysis indicated the main sources of PHEs could be industrial, especially coal powered thermal plant, iron and steel industries and cement industries and vehicular. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated that sites, seasons and their interaction were significantly affected by different PHEs as a whole. The health risk was calculated with total metal as well as mobile fraction of PHEs, which indicated that the actual non-carcinogenic risk due to bioavailable PHEs was less (HI < 1) when compared to total concentrations of PHEs. Carcinogenic risk was observed for total Cr in street dust (Child: 4.6E-06; Adult: 3.6E-06).

AB The zebra mussel is among the best studied freshwater molluscs in ecotoxicology, but information on the quagga mussel is lacking. Considering its potential spread, we selected a river in France in which zebra and quagga mussels coexisted, and then we used genetic markers to differentiate the two species and compared morphological parameters. cDNA sequencing assays of ten genes already used in zebra mussels were performed on quagga mussels to obtain functional specific primers. Then we analyzed the expression of genes involved in cellular metabolic activities (Cytochrome-c-oxidase - cox, and ATP synthase - atp), detoxification processes (Glutathione-S-Transferase - gst), oxidative stress (Catalase - cat), and digestive functions (Amylase - amy) on the two species. Whereas morphometric analysis underlined similarities in shape between the two species, relative gene expression profiles and metal concentrations evidenced strong differences. Quagga mussels notably presented half as high concentrations in Cd and Pb, two particularly toxic elements, as zebra mussels. These results imply that i) particular attention should be paid to properly distinguish the two species considering their similar external appearance, and ii) zebra mussels cannot be replaced by quagga mussels in ecotoxicological studies without preliminary investigations on biomarker response patterns. To our knowledge, this study is the first to have undertaken such an approach in gene expression analysis in quagga mussels, and more generally to have compared such biomarker responses of zebra and quagga mussels in the field.

AB The composition and structure of Humic acid (HA) is so heterogeneous that it brings significant barriers to investigate the interaction between HA and heavy metal ions. The isolation of HA with relatively homogeneity is a key to reveal the binding mechanisms between HA and heavy metals. In this work, ten HA fractions (HAs) were obtained by sequential alkali extraction procedure and nature differences of the extracted HAs were considered as explanatory factors for binding characteristics of Cu2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+. The results indicate that more large molecular weight (MW) HA subunits, less carboxyl and phenolic group contents, weaker aromaticity and polarity were measured with increasing extractions, inducing weaker binding capacity of HAs. Ligand binding and bi-Langmuir models indicated that the sorption capacity and binding affinity of earlier extracted HAs were higher than the latter ones. The peak area changes at 3427, 1599, and 619 cm(-1) pre- and post-adsorption in FTIR spectra suggested carboxyl, phenolic and nitrogen-containing groups were involved in the adsorption process. At the same time, the peak area difference between HAs and HAs-metal (AS) of phenolic groups were 8.22-20.50, 6.81-21.11 and 10.66-19.80% for Cu2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+, respectively, AS of carboxyl groups 6.64-17.03, 8.96-16.82 and 9.45-17.85% for Cu2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+, respectively, AS of nitrogen-containing groups 0.33-0.48, 0.20-1.38 and 0.31-0.59% for Cu2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+, respectively. AS of phenolic and carboxyl groups were larger than those of nitrogen-containing groups, implying that these two groups were the predominant binding sites suppliers for metal ions, which were also supported by the results of correlation analysis. This work is helpful to insight the environmental impacts of natural organic matter and the fate of heavy metals in natural environment.

AB Biochar amendment to soil is predicted globally as a means to enhance soil health. Alongside the beneficial result on soil nutrient availability and retention, biochar is presumed to increase soil macro / microbiota composition and improve plant growth. However, evidence for such an effect remains elusive in many tropical agricultural soils. The influence of biochar aged in soil was assessed on soil microbiota, macrobiota (Eudrilus eugeniae), seedling emergence and early plant growth of Oryza saliva and Solanum lycopersicum in tropical agricultural soil, over a 90 d biochar-soil contact time. Results showed negative impacts of increased loading of biochar on the survival and growth of E. eugeniae. LC50 and EC50 values ranged from 34.8% to 86.8% and 0.9-23.7% dry biochar kg(-1) soil, over time. The growth of the exposed earthworms was strongly reduced (R-2 = -0.866, p < 0.05). Biochar significantly increased microbiota abundance relative to the control soil (p < 0.001). However, fungal population was reduced by biochar addition. Biochar application threshold of 10% and 5% was observed for (O. saliva) and (S. lycopersicum), respectively. Furthermore, the addition of biochar to soil resulted in increased aboveground (shoot) biomass (p < 0.01). However, the data revealed that biochar did not increase the belowground (root) biomass of the plant species during the 90 d biochar-soil contact time. The shoot-to-root biomass increase indicates a direct toxic influence of biochar on plant roots. This reveals that nutrient availability is not the only mechanism involved in biota-biochar interactions. Detailed studies on specific biota-plant responses to biochars between tropical, temperate and boreal environments are needed to resolve the large variations and mechanisms behind these effects.

AB A 120-day pot experiment was conducted to compare the ability of natural attenuation and phytoremediation approaches to remove polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from soil amended with PAHs-contaminated biomass fly ash. The PAH removal from ash-treated soil was compared with PAHs-spiked soil. The removal of 16 individual PAHs from soil ranged between 4.8% and 87.8% within the experiment. The natural attenuation approach led to a negligible total PAH removal. The phytoremediation was the most efficient approach for PAH removal, while the highest removal was observed in the case of ash-treated soil. The content of low molecular weight (LMW) PAHs and the total PAHs in this treatment significantly decreased (P < .05) over the whole experiment by 47.6% and 29.4%, respectively. The tested level of PAH soil contamination (similar to 1600 mu g PAH/kg soil dry weight) had no adverse effects on maize growth as well on the biomass yield. In addition, the PAHs were detected only in maize roots and their bioaccumulation factors were significantly lower than 1 suggesting negligible PAH uptake from soil by maize roots. The results showed that PAHs of ash origin were similarly susceptible to removal as spiked PAHs. The presence of maize significantly boosted the PAH removal from soil and its aboveground biomass did not represent any environmental risk.

The toxin was conjugated to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), respectively, then the conjugates were used as coated antigens for enrichment (coated MC-LR-KLH) and screening (coated MC-LR-BSA) of MC-LR phage nanobodies from an alpaca phage display nanobody library. The antigen-specific phage particles were enriched effectively with four rounds of biopanning. At the last round of enrichment, total 20 positive monoclonal phage nanobodies were obtained from the library, which were analyzed after monoclonal phage enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), colony PCR and DNA sequencing. The most three positive nanobody genes, ANAb12, ANAb9 and ANAb7 were cloned into pET26b vector, then the nanobodies were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 respectively. After being purified, the molecular weight (M.W.) of all nanobodies were approximate 15 kDa with sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The purified nanobodies, ANAb12, ANAb9 and ANAb7 were used to establish the indirect competitive ELISA (IC-ELISA) for MC-LR, and their half-maximum inhibition concentrations (IC50) were 0.87, 1.17 and 1.47 mu g/L, their detection limits (IC10) were 0.06, 0.08 and 0.12 mu g/L, respectively. All of them showed strong cross-reactivity (CRs) of 82.7-116.9% for MC-RR, MC-YR and MC-WR, and weak CRs of less than 4.56% for MC-LW, less than 0.1% for MC-LY and MC-LF. It was found that all the IC-ELISAs for MC-LR spiked in tap water samples detection were with good accuracy, stability and repeatability, their recoveries were 84.0-106.5%, coefficient of variations (CVs) were 3.4-10.6%. These results showed that IC-ELISA based on the nanobodies from the alpaca phage display antibody library were promising for high sensitive determination of multiple MCs.

AB The present study aims to contribute to a better assessment of pesticide environmental and human health (here evaluated in the context of human exposure via food items) risks for the estuarine system by comprehensively studying the spatial and temporal occurrence of the pesticides atrazine, azoxystrobin, bentazon, lambda-cyhalothrin, penoxsulam and terbuthylazine in the River Mondego estuary (Portugal). Pesticide quantification was performed in surface water, sediment, macroalgae (Ulva spp., Gracilaria gracilis, Fucus vesiculosus), aquatic plants (Zostera noltii, Spartina maritime, Scirpus maritimus) and bivalves (Scrobicularia plan). Since intense precipitation could promote the runoff of pesticides from the surrounding agricultural fields, a single long-duration flood event was also studied in this estuarine system. Under normal flow conditions, quantified concentrations were determined mostly during summer in agreement with the pesticide application period. Azoxystrobin presented the highest detection frequency and atrazine (an herbicide used globally but banned in the EU) presented the second highest frequency, thus highlighting the need to include legacy pesticides in monitoring programmes. Pesticide concentrations in surface water determined in the present study suggest low risk to estuarine organisms. However, all the pesticides were bioacctunulated by S. pima, leading us to consider that pesticides may not only cause adverse effects on the aquatic organism itself, but should also be an alert for human exposure, for this is an edible species and is considered of economic interest. Concern is also expressed about edible seaweeds, since s-triazine pesticides were found in Ulva spp. and G. gracilis. Acknowledging these concerns, developing and establishing allowable pesticide safety values for edible seaweeds and bivalves is recommended, as well as monitoring bivalve pesticide levels, using the whole animal, as a human health exposure indicator for estuarine systems. During the studied flood event, it appears that no serious pesticide contamination has occurred in the River Mondego estuary.

AB Methionine is an essential/indispensible amino acid nutrient required by adult and larval honey bees (Apis mellifera L. [Hymenoptera: Apidae]). Bees are unable to rear broods on pollen deficient in methionine, and reportedly behaviorally avoid collecting pollen or nectar from florets deficient in methioinine. In contrast, it has been demonstrated that methionine is toxic to certain pest insects; thus it has been proposed as an effective biopesticide. As an ecofriendly integrated pest management agent, methionine boasts a novel mode of action differentiating it from conventional pesticides, while providing non-target safety. Pesticides that minimize collateral effects on bees are desirable, given the economic and ecological concerns about honey bee health. The aim of the present study was to assess the potential impact of the biopesticide methionine on non-target adult and larval honey bees. Acute contact adult toxicology bioassays, oral adult assessments and chronic larval toxicity assessments were performed as per U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements. Our results demonstrated that methionine fits the U.S. EPA category of practically nontoxic (ie. lethal dose to 50% mortality or LD50 > 11 mu g/bee) to adult honey bees. The contact LD50 was > 25 mu g/bee and the oral LD50 was > 100 mu g/bee. Mortality was observed in larval bees that ingested DL-methionine (effective concentration to 50% mortality or EC50 560 mu g/bee). Therefore, we conclude that methionine poses little threat to the health of the honey bee, due to unlikely exposure at concentrations shown to elicit toxic effects.

AB The increasing presence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments in the last decades, derived from human and veterinary use, has become an important environmental problem. Previous studies have shown that ibuprofen (IB) and carbamazepine (CBZ) modify physiological and biochemical processes in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) in a temperature-dependent manner. In other vertebrates, there is evidence that both of these pharmaceuticals interfere with the 'arachidonic acid (AA) cascade', which is responsible for the biosynthesis of numerous enzymes that are involved in the osmoregulatory process. The present work aims to study the temperature-dependent effects of these two pharmaceuticals on several biochemical and molecular parameters in Senegalese sole. Regarding osmoregulation, Na+, K+,-ATPase enzyme activity was determined in the gills, kidney and intestine, and the expressions of both Na+, K+-ATPase 1 alpha-subunit isoforms (ATP1A1a and ATP1A1b) were quantified in gills. Gill prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 (PTGS2) gene expression and fatty acid composition were selected to determine the interference of both pharmaceuticals with the AA cascade. Senegalese sole juveniles, acclimatised at 15 degrees C or 20 degrees C, were exposed through intraperitoneal injection to IB (10 mg/kg) and CBZ (1 mg/kg) for 48 h. Non-injected fish (Control) and those injected with the carrier (sunflower oil; S.O.), acclimated at each of the two temperatures, were used for comparison. The results show that IB directly affected the osmoregulatory mechanisms that alter gill and intestine Na+, K+-ATPase activities. In addition, the copy number of ATP1A1a was higher at 20 degrees C than at 15 degrees C, which could be a direct response to the temperature variation. The gene expression of PTGS2 was affected by neither drug administration nor acclimation temperature. Nevertheless, detailed analysis of AA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) percentages revealed a CBZ-derived effect in the fatty acid composition of the gills.

AB Cyberlindnera jadinii M9 and Wickerhamomyces anomalus M10 isolated from textile-dye liquid effluents has shown capacity for chromium detoxification via Cr(VI) biological reduction. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of hexavalent chromium on synthesis of novel and/or specific proteins involved in chromium tolerance and reduction in response to chromium overload in two indigenous yeasts. A study was carried out following a proteomic approach with W anomalus M10 and Cy. jadinii M9 strains. For this, proteins extracts belonging to total cell extracts, membranes and mitochondria were analyzed. When Cr(VI) was added to culture medium there was an over-synthesis of 39 proteins involved in different metabolic pathways. In both strains, chromium supplementation changed protein biosynthesis by upregulating proteins involved in stress response, methionine metabolism, energy production, protein degradation and novel oxide-reductase enzymes. Moreover, we observed that Cy. jadinii M9 and W. anomalus M10 displayed ability to activate superoxide dismutase, catalase and chromate reductase activity. Two enzymes from the total cell extracts, type II nitroreductase (Frm2) and flavoprotein wrbA (Ycp4), were identified as possibly responsible for inducing crude chromate-reductase activity in cytoplasm of W. anomalus M10 under chromium overload. In Cyjadinii M9, mitochondria' Ferredoxine-NADP reductase (Yah1) and membrane FAD flavoprotein (Lpd1) were identified as probably involved in Cr(VI) reduction. To our knowledge, this is the first study proposing chromate reductase activity of these four enzymes in yeast and reporting a relationship between protein synthesis, enzymatic response and chromium biospeciation in Cy. jadinii and W. anomalus.

AB Peat is an excellent material for metal sorption since it naturally contains different kinds of functional groups that can sorb metal cations from water. The main objective of this work was to test low-cost treatment (acid and alkali) methods for natural peat, which would improve the settling properties of peat particles while maintaining its metal removal efficiency. Particularly, the poor settling properties of peat hinder its practical application. The study revealed that NaOH-treated peat (0.1 M) had excellent settling properties and could be applied in wastewater applications having mixing and settling systems without a settling aid. The superior leaching of humic and fulvic acids in alkaline treatment caused a change in morphology, making it a harder and sticky material. Moreover, the NaOH-treated (0.1 M) peat was proven to be the most efficient material for nickel removal followed by the HCl-treated (0.2 M) peat, citric acid-treated (0.16 M) peat and water-treated peat. A higher temperature and longer time slightly increased the Ni removal efficiency with NaOH-treated peat material. The settling of HCl-treated peat was studied further using polyacrylamide flocculants (cationic, neutral, anionic). Cationic flocculants performed best and the cationic charge density also had an effect on the flocculation performance of peat particles. This study provides further evidence that peat can be applied in the treatment of metal-containing wastewaters.

AB This study focused on the inorganic environmental contaminants in specific food products which form part of the food chain of the population residing in the area of Southern Italy (Gela) where there is a high mortality rate linked to tumor diseases and congenital malformations. Determination of toxic metals was performed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The toxicological data for every toxic element has been applied to evaluate the risk for the consumer by calculating the amount of potentially toxic element that would ingest an average of 60 kg weight individual adult. The analysis of the investigated samples shows a high level of metal contamination which can be linked both to the polluted water and air. The obtained results give us an idea about the agricultural products contamination and possible exposure of local people through the food chain.

AB Increased interest in ionic liquids (ILs) is due to their designable and tunable unique physicochemical properties, which are utilized for a wide variety of chemical and biotechnological applications. ILs containing the Eris (pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate ([FAP]) anion have been shown to have excellent hydrolytic, electrochemical and thermal stability and have been successfully used in various applications. In the present study the influence of the cation on the toxicity of the [FAP] anion was investigated. Due to the properties of [FAP] ILs, the IL-toxicity of seven cations with [FAP] compared to [CI] was examined by determination of minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MSC) on six Gram-positive and six Gram-negative clinically relevant bacteria. For the first time, to our knowledge, the results provide evidence for a decrease in toxicity with increasing alkyl side-chain length, indicating that the combination of both ions is responsible for this 'reverse side-chain effect'. These findings could portend development of new non-toxic ILs as green alternatives to conventional organic solvents.

AB The importance of controlling weeds and the needs of agricultural production mean that different herbicides are used in certain agricultural applications, and so organisms in aquatic environments are often exposed to mixtures of herbicides. This study examined the single and combined toxicity of atrazine (ATR), butachlor (BUT), halo-sulfuron-methyl (HAL) and mesotrione (MES), widely used herbicides with different sites of action, to the microalga Selenastrtun capricornutum after 48 h and 72 h algal growth inhibition, using the combination index (CI)-isobologram equation. The order of toxicity of single herbicides after 48 h and 72 h of exposure ranked HAL > ATR > BUT > MES. After 48 h exposure the two mixtures of BUT + MES and BUT + HAL + MES showed a synergism effect at the effect (fa) level of 0.5. After 72 h exposure the five mixtures of ATR + BUT, BUT + HAL, BUT + MES, HAL + MES and BUT + HAL + MES showed synergism or additive effects at fa 0.5. The results indicated that the increase in toxicity caused by mixtures of these herbicides could, at suitable concentrations, pose a significant hazard to microalgae in the aquatic environment. The CI-isobologram equation may be a useful tool for the assessment of herbicide toxicity in aquatic ecosystems.

AB The ecotoxicological consequences of residues from pharmaceutical drugs on aquatic biota have necessitated the development of sensitive and reliable techniques to assess the impact of these xenobiotics on aquatic organisms. This study investigated the alteration in DNA structure, molecular responses and the activities of Na+ -K+ -ATPase and antioxidant enzymes in the gill of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, exposed to long-term effects at the concentrations (0.14, 0.28 and 0.57 mg L-1) of verapamil in static renewal system for 15, 30, 45 and 60 days. Evaluation of DNA structure, using single cell gel electrophoresis, revealed certain degree of DNA damages in the gill in a time and concentration-dependent relationship. Transcription of mRNA of superoxide dismutase (sod), catalase (cat) and heat shock protein (hsp70) genes in the gill of the fish showed the genes were up regulated. Na+-K+-ATPase activity was inhibited in a concentration and time dependent manner. The indices of oxidative stress biomarkers (lipid peroxidation and carbonyl protein) as well as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase were elevated in the treated fish in comparison to the control. Further, the level of reduced glutathione and catalase activity were inhibited at 0.28 mg L-1 after day 30. Longterm exposure to sub-lethal concentration of verapamil can cause DNA damages, molecular effects and oxidative stress in O. niloticus. The biomarkers analysed can be used as early warning signals in environmental biomonitoring and assessment of drug contamination in aquatic ecosystem.

AB Cadmium (Cd) is a serious environmental threat because it accumulates in plants from soil and is subsequently transported into the food cycle. Increased Cd uptake in plants disrupts plant metabolism and hampers crop growth and development. Therefore, remediation of Cd from soil and enhancing plant tolerance to metal toxicity is vital. In the present study, we investigated the function of different doses of citric acid (CA) on Cd toxicity in terms of metal accumulation and stress tolerance in mustard (Brassica juncea L.). Brassica juncea seedlings (12 day-old) were treated with Cd (0.5 mM Cd and 1.0 mM CdCl2) alone and in combination with CA (0.5 mM and 1.0 mM) in a semi-hydroponic medium for three days. Cadmium accumulation in the roots and shoots of the mustard seedlings increased in a dose-dependent manner and was higher in the roots. Increasing the Cd concentration led to reduced growth, biomass, water status, and chlorophyll (chl) content resulting from increased oxidative damage (elevated malondialdehyde, MDA content; hydrogen peroxide, H2O2 level; superoxide, 02 generation; lipoxygenase, LOX activity; and methylglyoxal, MG content) and downregulating of the major enzymes of the antioxidant defense and glyoxalase systems. Under Cd stress, both doses of CA improved the growth of the plants by enhancing leaf relative water content (RWC) and chl content; reducing oxidative damage; enhancing the pool of ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) and the activities of the antioxidant enzymes (ascorbate peroxidase, APX; monodehydroascorbate reductase, MDHAR; dehydroascorbate reductase, DHAR; glutathione reductase, GR; glutathione peroxidase, GPX; superoxide dismutase, SOD; catalase, CAT); improving the performance of the glyoxalase system (glyoxalase I, Gly I and glyoxalase II, Gly II activity); and increasing the phytochelatin (PC) content. Exogenous CA also increased the root and shoot Cd content and Cd translocation from the roots to the shoots in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that CA plays a dual role in mustard seedlings by increasing phytoremediation and enhancing stress tolerance through upregulating the antioxidant defense and glyoxalase systems.

AB Detection and toxicity assessment of waterborne contaminants are crucial for protecting human health and the environment. Development of easy-to-implement, rapid and cost-effective tools to measure anthropogenic effects on watersheds are critical for responsible management, particularly in times of increasing development and urbanization. Traditionally, environmental toxicology has focused on limited endpoints, such as lethality and fertility, which are directly affecting population levels. However, more sensitive readings are needed to assess sub-lethal effects. Monitoring of contaminant-induced behavior alterations was proposed before, but is difficult to implement in the wild and performing it in aquatic laboratory models seem more suited. For this purpose, we adapted a photo-dependent swimming response (PDR) that was previously described in zebrafish larva. We first asked if PDR was present in other aquatic animals. We measured PDR in larvae from two freshwater prawn species (Macrobrachium rosenbergii, MR, and Macrobrachium carcinus, MC) and from another fish the fathead minnow (FHM, Pimephales promelas). In all, we found a strong and reproducible species-specific PDR, which is arguing that this behavior is important, therefore an environmental relevant endpoint. Next, we measured PDR in fish larvae after acute exposure to copper, a common waterborne contaminant. FHM larvae were hyperactive at all tested concentrations in contrast to ZF larvae, which exhibited a concentration-dependent hyperactivity. In addition to this well-accepted anxiety-like behavior, we examined two more: photo-stimulated startle response (PSSR) and center avoidance (CA). Both were significantly increased. Therefore, PDR measures after acute exposure to this waterborne contaminant provided as sensitive readout for its detection and toxicity assessment. This approach represents an opportunity to diagnostically examine any substance, even when present in complex mixtures like ambient surface waters. Mechanistic studies of toxicity using the extensive molecular tool kit of ZF could be a direct extension of such approaches.

AB Selenium phytotoxicity involves processes like reactive nitrogen species overproduction and nitrosative protein modifications. This study evaluates the toxicity of two selenium forms (selenite and selenate at 0 mu M, 20 mu M, 50 mu M and 100 mu M concentrations) and its correlation with protein tyrosine nitration in the organs of hydroponically grown Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L.).
   Selenate treatment resulted in large selenium accumulation in both Brassica organs, while selenite showed slight root-to-shoot translocation resulting in a much lower selenium accumulation in the shoot. Shoot and root growth inhibition and cell viability loss revealed that Brassica tolerates selenate better than selenite. Results also show that relative high amounts of selenium are able to accumulate in Brassica leaves without obvious visible symptoms such as chlorosis or necrosis. The more severe phytotoxicity of selenite was accompanied by more intense protein tyrosine nitration as well as alterations in nitration pattern suggesting a correlation between the degree of Se forms-induced toxicities and nitroproteome size, composition in Brassica organs. These results imply the possibility of considering protein tyrosine nitration as novel biomarker of selenium phytotoxicity, which could help the evaluation of asymptomatic selenium stress of plants.

AB Selenite (Se (IV)) and selenate (Se (IV)) have recently been demonstrated to be equally effective in inhibiting mercury (Hg) phytotoxicity to plants. This assertion is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential effects of Se species (Se4+ and Se6+) on the inhibition of the mercury (Hg) bioavailability to pak choi in dry land. Pot experiments with exposure to different dosages of mercuric chloride (HgCl2) and selenite (Na2SeO3) or selenate (Na2SeO4) were treated. To compare the influence of Se (IV) and Se (VI) on the bioaccumulation and bioavailability of Hg, the levels of total Hg in different pak choi (Brassica chinensis L.) tissues (roots and shoots) and the distribution changes of Hg fractions in soil before planting and after harvest were determined as well as the Hg IR values in soils (relative binding intensity) were analyzed. Results showed that application Se (IV) reduced the concentrations of Hg in pak choi roots more than Se (VI). Hg concentrations were also decreased in pak choi shoots in Se (IV) treatments, while which notably increased in Se (VI) treatments. Thus, Se (IV) plays a more important role than Se (VI) in limiting the absorption and bioaccumulation of Hg in pak choi. Moreover, this inhibition may only significantly occur when Se (IV) is at an appropriate level (2.5 mg/kg). In addition, the good correlations between the proportions of mobile Hg fractions (soluble and exchangeable fractions), IR values with the Hg concentrations in plants were observed. This affirmed the importance of the Hg fractions transformation and the IR indicator of Hg in the assessment of their bioavailability. Our findings regarding the importance of Se (IV) influence in reducing Hg bioaccumulation not only provided the correct appraisal about the effect of Se species on the inhibition of the Hg phytotoxicity to pak choi in dry land, but also be a good reference for selecting Se fertilizer forms (Se4+ or Se6+).

AB The sensitivity to contaminants of natural populations varies greatly depending on their historical exposure and on the sex of the individual. These factors result in great uncertainty in ecotoxicological risk assessments and challenge the protection of marine biodiversity. This study investigated the role of background pollution in the environment in shaping the sensitivity of males and females of the common marine amphipod Allorchestes compressa to the common trace marine pollutant, copper (Cu). Female and male amphipods were collected from two sites: Geelong (the polluted site) and Clifton Springs (the clean site). Amphipods were exposed to Cu treatments of 0, 50, 100, and 250 mu g/L for 10 days, followed by a 10-day recovery period. Cu-exposed males from Geelong showed a reduction in feeding rate at a higher Cu concentration than males from Clifton Springs, suggesting that they have a higher tolerance to Cu than males from Clifton Springs. This can be explained by their higher base level of metallothioneins (MTs) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), the key physiological responses for detoxification and defence against damages from Cu toxicity. Males showed a higher tolerance to Cu than females. This pattern was similar in both populations, which may be associated with a higher level of GST. During the recovery period, only males from Geelong fully recovered to the control level. Our results emphasize the importance of considering population- and sex-specific sensitivity of invertebrates to contaminants in eco-toxicological risk assessments.

AB Radiotherapy represents a critical component in cancer treatment. However, premature ovarian failure (POF) is a major hurdle of deleterious off-target effects in young females, which, therefore, call for an effective radioprotective agent. The present study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the protective effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) against gamma-radiation-provoked POF. Immature female Sprague-Dawley rats were orallyadministered NAC (50 mg/kg) and were exposed to a single whole-body dose of 3.2 Gy Upsilon-radiation. NAC administration remarkably reversed abnormal serum estradiol and anti-Miillerian hormone levels by 73% and 40%, respectively while ameliorating the histopathological and ultrastructural alterations-triggered by gamma-radiation. Mechanistically, NAC alleviated radiation-induced oxidative damage through significantly increased glutathione pemxidase activity by 102% alongside with decreasing NADPH oxidase subunits (p22 and NOX4) gene expressions by 48% and 38%, respectively compared to the irradiated untreated group. Moreover, NAC administration achieved its therapeutic effect by inhibiting ovarian apoptosis-induced by radiation through downregulating p53 and Bax levels by 33% and 16%, respectively while increasing the Bcl-2 mRNA expression by 135%. Hence, the Bax/Bc12 ratio and cytochrome c expression were subsequently reduced leading to decreased caspase 3 activity by 43%. Importantly, the anti-apoptotic property of NAC could be attributed to inactivation of MAPK signaling molecules; p38 and JNK, and enhancement of the ovarian vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Taken together, our results suggest that NAC can inhibit radiotherapy-induced POF while preserving ovarian function and structure through upregulating VEGF expression and suppressing NOX4/MAPK/p53 apoptotic signaling.

AB Widespread arsenic (As) contamination is a severe environmental and public health concern. Isatis cappadocica, an arsenic hyperaccumulator, holds great potential to clean up As-contaminated soil and groundwater. Iron oxide is one of the most common metal oxides in the natural environment and its nanoparticulate form has been previously utilized for the removal of heavy metals/metalloids from wastewater. However, there is a paucity of information on the impact of iron oxide nanoparticles on the growth and physiological properties of I. cappadocica and its effectiveness on As removal. Current study reports for the first time the impact of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and glutathione (GSH) modified superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (nFe(3)O(4) and nFe(3)O(4)@GSH) on the physiological characteristic of I. cappadocica and its accumulation of As under hydroponic condition. nFe(3)O(4)@GSH alleviated the harmful impact of As and significantly increased the shoot biomass of I. cappadocica by enhancing the plant defense mechanisms. The application of GSH, nFe(3)O(4) and nFe(3)O(4)@GSH all lowered the As concentration in plant shoots as a protective mechanism. However, the substantial shoot biomass increase due to nFe(3)O(4)@GSH resulted in a 56% higher As accumulation in plant shoots than in plants exposed to As alone, indicating the strong effectiveness of nFe(3)O(4)@GSH as a novel enhancer of the As phytoremediation by I. cappadocica. Our data further showed that the beneficial effect of nFe(3)O(4)@GSH on As phytoremediation is due to the enhancement of activities of several enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants.

AB A better comprehensive understanding of the influence of soil/solution properties on cadmium (Cd) phytotoxicity is essential for soil Cd ecological risk assessment. The toxicity of soil spiked Cd to Ligustrum japonicum 'Howardii' seedling growth was conducted by the greenhouse pot experiments using 13 typical forest soils selected from mainland of China. The results showed that the ranges of Cd toxicity thresholds of 10% seedling growth inhibition (EC10) and 50% inhibition (EC50) followed the order: soil pore water Cd (EC10 on average 0.88 mg L-1 with the variation of 54.9 folds and EC50 on average 2.28 mg L(-1 )with variation of 41.8 folds), DTPA extractable Cd (EC10 on average 5.4 mg kg(-1) with 20.9 folds variation and EC50 on average 17.86 mg kg(-1) with 6.6 folds variation), total added Cd (EC10 on average 6.55 mg kg(-1) with 16.7 folds variation and EC50 on average 22.11 mg kg(-1) with 5.1 folds variation), which suggested that whatever the available Cd expressed, its toxicity is largely affected by soil properties. The empirical multiple equations were well developed between different fractions of Cd toxicity thresholds ECx (x = 10 or 50) and soil/solution. The results also showed that the pH inversely correlated with EC10 (r(2) = 0.54, P < 0.01) and EC50 (r(2) = 0.63, P < 0.001) based on soil pore water, indicating the ECx decreased with more toxicity as pH increased. No single significant soil solution properties were found for ECx in DTPA extractable Cd. For the ECx of DTPA extractable and total Cd, the content of aluminum oxides in soil and soil pH were the two significant factors inversely related with ECx, which explained 68%-79% of the inter-soil variation, respectively. Overall, soil or solution pH was the most important factor controlling Cd toxicity thresholds. Meanwhile, significant negative correlations existed between the soil solution pH and the slopes of parameter (b) of the dose-response curves for different fractions of Cd, implying that the growth of toxic effect enhanced as unit Cd dosage increased in low pH soils. These results will be helpful to evaluate the metal ecological risk in forest soils.

AB Brazilian freshwater ecosystems are continuously exposed to pesticides and domestic sewage. The Uruguay River was chosen for this study because of its international importance, as it flows through Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. It receives contaminants such as pesticides and domestic residues. Thus, the aim of this study to assess the accumulation of pesticides in muscle of the fish Astyanax jacuhiensis, its biochemical responses, and the presence of pesticides in water. In total, seven pesticides were registered in water from both river sites. Eight pesticides were detected in fish muscle. The biochemical responses showed that brain lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonyl (PC) in A. jacuhiensis were higher in the summer. Muscle showed the highest LPO levels in the spring and the highest PC in the summer. Liver LPO and PC levels were higher in the spring and summer. In the gills, the PC was higher in the spring and the LPO in the spring and winter. In the brain and in the gills, glutathione-S-transferase activity was high in the summer and autumn. Catalase activity was lower during the winter and spring. Non-protein thiol (NPSH) levels were lower in the brain in the winter and spring. Muscle tissue showed lower NPSH in the winter (site 1). Liver NPSH showed increased levels in liver in the spring and winter (site 2). The biochemical results clearly is related to pesticides and/or to the presence of other contaminants in the water such as metals or domestic sewage. The accumulation of pesticides in fish muscle added evidence that pesticides have been used in the area surrounding the Uruguay River. In conclusion, the bio-markers assayed in the present study could be used in future investigations considering other sampling sites along Uruguay River.

AB The fungicide carbendazim (CBM) has been applied all around the world but its potential adverse effects other than its recognized activity as endocrine disruptor in non target organisms have been scarcely studied. The aims of this work were (1) to use a battery of biomarkers that can reflect potential negative effects such as oxidative stress, genotoxicity, neurotoxicity or altered immune response; and (2) to examine biomarkers of detoxification by analyzing the gene expression of cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) and the multi-xenobiotic resistance protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the freshwater fish Jenynsia multidentata exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of CBM during 24 h. Fish exposed to 5 mu g/L showed inhibition of GST activity and an increase of TBARs contents in gills, the organ of direct contact with waterborne contaminants. Genotoxicity - measured in peripheral blood-was evidenced by the increases of micronuclei frequency when fish were exposed to 5, 10 and 100 mu g/L CBM and of nuclear abnormalities (NA) frequency at 0.05, 0.5, 5, 10 and 100 mu g/L CBM. The expression inhibition of interleukin (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha) at 10, and 5 and 10 mu g/L CBM, respectively, indicated an altered immune response. The expression of CYP1A1 was down regulated in liver at 10 mu g/L and of P-gp at 5 mu g/L CBM, indicating a possible slow on CBM metabolization. On the other hand, in gills CYP1A1 decreased at 5 and 10 mu g/L while P-gp was induced at 5 and 100 mu g/L CBM. Overall, most of these significant effects were detected below 10 mu g/L CBM, in a range of realistic concentrations in aquatic ecosystems worldwide.

AB Cadmium (Cd) contamination is the most common and extensive heavy metal pollution in the farmland of China. Phytoremediation is considered as a promising measure for Cd-contaminated soil remediation, but the remediation efficiency still needs to be enhanced. Biochar as an effective amendment medium is widely manufactured and studied for the soil remediation of heavy metals. In this study, a greenhouse pot trial was conducted to investigate the effects of cornstalk biochar on Cd accumulation of Beta vulgaris var. cicla L. (Beta vulgaris) in Cd contaminated soil. The Cd availability, speciation and nutrients in soil, biomass and Cd chemical forms in the Beta vulgaris root were studied to explore the mechanism that how the cornstalk biochar promoted Cd accumulation in Beta vulgaris. Biochar amendment reduced the DTPA-extractable Cd concentration and stimulated the growth of root. Compared to the Beta vulgaris without biochar treatment, the results of 5% biochar amendment showed that the root dry weight of Beta vulgaris increased to 267%, Cd accumulation in Beta vulgaris increased to 206% and the Cd concentration in leaves and mots increased by 36% and 52%, respectively. Additionally, after 5% biochar was applied to soil, the total content of organic matter-bound Cd and residual Cd increased by 38%, while the content of Fe-Mn oxides-bound Cd decreased by 40%. Meanwhile, Cd may mainly bind to the mot cell wall and the ratio of NaCl-extracted Cd to HAc-extracted Cd increased to 166% with 5% biochar amendment. According to our study, Cd in soil can be removed by Beta vulgaris and phytoremediation efficiency can be improved with biochar amendment. The combination of phytoremediation and biochar amendment is a promising strategy for the Cd-contaminated soil remediation.

AB Exposure to PM2.5 can cause serious harm to the respiratory system. Until now, although many toxicological studies have shown that pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by long-term PM2.5 exposure, there is no evidence that Endothelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EndMT) can trigger the process of pulmonary fibrosis after exposure. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs detected in mammalian cells. Nevertheless, researchers have not found whether lncRNAs participate in PM2.5 induced EndMT during pathophysiological duration. The Balb/c mouse model was exposed to PM2.5 for 4 months by dynamic intoxication. The levels of specific endothelial and mesenchymal markers were evaluated by molecular biology experiments to elucidate the mechanisms of EndMT induced by PM2.5 in lung tissues. LncRNA microarray analysis of the established mouse model of PM2.5 exposure was performed. Based on a bioinformatics analysis and RT-qPCR analysis, lncRNA Gm16410 attracted our attention. The change of lncRNA Gm16410 in mouse pulmonary vascular endothelial cells (MHCs) exposed to PM2.5 was verified, and the mechanism of lncRNA Gm16410 in EndMT was discussed. The changes of cell function were evaluated by cell migration and proliferation experiments. The molecular biology experiments proved that PM2.5 induced EndMT by activating the TGF-beta 1/Smad3/p-Smad3 pathway in vitro. The relationship of EndMT and lncRNA Gm16410 was verified in mouse lung tissues and MHC cells by PM2.5 exposure. The involvement of lncRNA Gm16410 in PM2.5-induced EndMT highlights the potential of lncRNA to promote pulmonary fibrosis under environmental pollution.

AB The soil cadmium (Cd) contamination is a ubiquitous environmental problem that has resulted from intense irrigation with wastewater. This pot trial was conducted with aim to produce safe food with Cd tolerant wheat cultivar in wastewater irrigated soils. For this purpose, two wheat cultivars NARC-2011 (Cd tolerant) and Shafaq-2006 (Cd sensitive) were screened out and selected, after conducting a pilot trial of twelve local wheat cultivars against Cd stress. Both cultivars were grown in naturally contaminated soils with Cd concentrations (4.18, 3.23, 2.29 and 1.25 mg kg(-1)). After harvesting, NARC-2011 showed significant photosynthetic attributes, grain biochemical parameters and yield. Additionally, Cd concentrations in edible grains of NARC-2011 cultivars were found within standard limits (200 mg kg(-1)), in all contaminated soils. Furthermore, a marked decrease in Cd bioavailability was noted with cultivar NARC-2011, where contribution of mobile Cd fractions (exchangeable and reducible) percentage was decreased, while immobile Cd fractions percentage increased (oxidizable and residual). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reflects the maturity and stability of humic and fulvic like acid fractions and revealed that humification of these compounds after prolonged sludge enriched wastewater irrigation lowered the Cd availability. The wheat cultivar NARC-2011 (Cd tolerant) could be opted to grow on soils irrigated with waste-water for a long time, as Cd bioavailability decreased with ageing due to stabilized humic substances and varietal tolerance.

AB Arthrobacter sp. JQ-1 can completely degrade 500 mg/L of DEHP within 3 days. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Cu2+ could reach 1.56 mM, however, 5.0 mg/L Cu2+ apparently inhibited DEHP degradation and bacterial growth. Consequently, JQ-1 was exposed to the DEHP-copper environment to verify the toxicity mechanism based on the physiological responses of cellular multiple interfaces (cellular surface, membrane and intracellular characteristics). The results showed the combination of 500 mg/L DEHP and 5.0 mg/L Cu2+ significantly decreased cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) and the absolute value of zeta potential, which implied the bioavailability of DEHP was decreased. The cellular surface changes were mainly due to the interaction between Cu2+ and some functional groups (CH2, CH3, aromatic rings, and amide). The weakened proton-motive force (PMF) across the plasma membrane may interfere the formation and utilization of energy, which is not conducive to the repair process of cellular damages. In this study, Non-invasive micro-test technology (NMT) was applied to the research of combined toxicity of DEHP and heavy metal ions for the first time. DEHP-copper intensified K+ efflux and Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane, which disturbed ion homeostasis of K+ and Ca2+ and might induce apoptosis and further inhibit DEHP degradation. The decline of intracellular esterase activity indicated that the metabolic capacity is apparently restrained. This study enhances our understanding of cellular different interface processes responding to combined pollutants.

AB In this study, an iron-doped metal-organic framework (MOF) Fe/ZIF-8 was synthesized from ZIF-8 at room temperature. Direct carbonization of Fe/ZIF-8 under a nitrogen atmosphere produced nanoporous nitrogen doped carbon nanoparticles decorated with Fe component (Fe/NC). The Fe/NC exhibited a large surface area (1221.185 m(2) g(-1)) and narrow pore-size distribution (3-5 nm). The nanoporous Fe/NC components along with Nafion were used to modify a glassy carbon electrode for the electrochemical determination of chloramphenicol and metronidazole via linear sweep voltammetry. Under optimal conditions, the reduction peak currents (observed at -0.237 V and -0.071 V vs. Ag/AgCl) of these analytes increased linearly with increasing chloramphenicol and metronidazole concentrations in the range of 0.1-100 mu M and 0.5-30 mu M, with the detection limits estimated to be 31 nM and 165 nM, respectively. This result was attributed to the large surface area, porous structure, high nitrogen content, and as well as the electrocatalytic effect of Fe atoms embeded in the carbon support. The proposed sensor was used for chloramphenicol and metronidazole analysis in samples, providing satisfactory results.

AB Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, with 11,669,259 positive cases and 539,906 deaths globally as of July 8, 2020. The objective of the present study was to determine whether meteorological parameters and air quality affect the transmission of COVID-19, analogous to SARS. We captured data from 29 provinces, including numbers of COVID-19 cases, meteorological parameters, air quality and population flow data, between Jan 21, 2020 and Apr 3, 2020. To evaluate the transmissibility of COVID-19, the basic reproductive ratio (R-0) was calculated with the maximum likelihood "removal" method, which is based on chain-binomial model, and the association between COVID-19 and air pollutants or meteorological parameters was estimated by correlation analyses. The mean estimated value of R-0 was 1.79 + 0.31 in 29 provinces, ranging from 1.08 to 2.45. The correlation between Ro and the mean relative humidity was positive, with coefficient of 0.370. In provinces with high flow, indicators such as carbon monoxide (CO) and 24-h average concentration of carbon monoxide (CO_24 h) were positively correlated with Ro, while nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 24-h average concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2_24 h) and daily maximum temperature were inversely correlated to Ro, with coefficients of 0.644, 0.661, -0.636, -0.657, -0.645, respectively. In provinces with medium flow, only the weather factors were correlated with R-0, including mean/maximum/minimum air pressure and mean wind speed, with coefficients of -0.697, -0.697, -0.697 and -0.841, respectively. There was no correlation with R-0 and meteorological parameters or air pollutants in provinces with low flow. Our findings suggest that higher ambient CO concentration is a risk factor for increased transmissibility of the novel coronavirus, while higher temperature and air pressure, and efficient ventilation reduce its transmissibility. The effect of meteorological parameters and air pollutants varies in different regions, and requires that these issues be considered in future modeling disease transmissibility.

AB Heavy metal contamination in soil due to human activities is a global environmental problem. To find a washing solution that can significantly decontaminate heavy metals and minimize damage to soil quality, six washing solutions (H3PO4, K2CO3, CH3COOK, KH2PO4, HNO3 and KNO3) were used at different concentrations to treat contaminated soil collected from the field. Furthermore, changes in soil physicochemical properties and heavy metal speciation among prewashed, postwashed and neutralized samples were tested. Additionally, soil enzyme activities and soil microbial diversities in contaminated soil among the prewashed, postwashed and neutralized samples were also measured. Finally, a pot experiment was conducted with Mentha haplocalyx to test the efficiency of soil washing. The results revealed that the optimum washing solution was 1% HNO3 and that the removal rates of Cd and Pb were 75.7% and 60.6%, respectively, under treatment conditions of 35 degrees C, 90 min and a solid-liquid ratio of 1:10. The pH, total phosphorous, available potassium, soil enzyme activities and soil microbial diversity decreased significantly after washing. However, after the neutralization of washed soil with Ca(OH)(2), the available phosphorous, total nitrogen and some microorganisms increased significantly compared with those of the soil before washing. After treatment with 1% HNO3, the chemical forms of Cd and Pb in soil mainly existed as F-1 (exchangeable) fractions, but the main forms of the two metals changed to F-5 (residual) and F-3 (bound to Fe-Mn oxides) fractions after neutralization with Ca(OH)(2). In addition, the plant height, root length, and fresh and dry weight of M. haplocalyx were not significantly affected by soil neutralization, while the Pb, Cu and As concentrations in the aboveground parts significantly decreased. Therefore, although soil washing could effectively remove Pb and Cd in soil, it also resulted in a significant decline in soil quality, but soil neutralization could effectively alleviate the negative effects during soil washing.

AB Recent evidence indicates that chronic, low-dose exposure to mixtures of pesticides can cause adverse responses in a variety of cells, tissues and organs, although interactions between pesticides circulating in the blood and cancer cells remain largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of a mixture of four pesticides to induce multidrug resistance against the chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and temozolomide in the human U87 glioblastoma cell line, and to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance. We found that the repeated administration of the pesticide mixture (containing the insecticides chlorpyrifos-ethyl and deltamethrin, the fungicide metiram, and the herbicide glyphosate) induced a strong drug resistance in U87 cells. The resistance was durable and transferred to subsequent cell generations. In addition, we detected a significant over-expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporters P-gp/ABCB1 and BRCP/ABCG2 as well as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST)/M1-type cellular detoxification function, known to have important roles in multidrug resistance, thus providing molecular support for the acquired multidrug resistance phenotype and shedding light on the mechanism of resistance. We further determined that there was lower mortality in the resistant brain tumor cells and that the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was activated at a lower rate after chemotherapy compared to non-resistant control cells. In addition, multidrug-resistant cells were found to have both higher motility and wound-healing properties, suggesting a greater metastatic potential. Our results suggest that the investigation of P-gp, BRCP and GST/M1 multidrug resistance gene expression and/ or protein levels in biopsy specimens of brain tumor patients who were at risk of pesticide exposure could be beneficial in determining chemotherapy dose and prolonging patient survival.

AB The activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) occurs through the binding of dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) or natural ligands. In this pathway, the AHR-ARNT (AHR nuclear translocator) heterodimer serves to regulate critical physiological functions, such as immune responses and the metabolism of xenobiotics. Birds have three AHR isoforms (AHR1, AHR1 beta, and AHR2) and two ARNT isoforms (ARNT1 and ARNT2). However, how AHR and ARNT dimerization pair in birds regulates the AHR signaling pathway in an isoform-specific manner remains unknown. In this study, we initially sought to clarify the major chicken AHR-ARNT (ckAHR-ckARNT) pairs by estimating the mRNA tissue distributions of various ckAHR and ckARNT isoforms. Our results indicated that the ckAHR1-ckARNT1 represented the major dimerization pair in most tissues except the brain. We then measured the transactivation potencies of various ckAHR-ckARNT pairs by natural ligands and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), in in vitro reporter gene assays using COS-7 and LMH cell lines. Our results from the in vitro assays demonstrated that the ckAHR1-ckARNT1 pair was strongly activated by the five natural ligands, namely, 6-formylindolo [3,2-b]carbazole, L-kynurenin, kynurenic acid, indoxyl-3-sulfate, and 1,3,7-tribromodibenzo-p-dioxin, but not by TCDD. In in silico ligand docking simulations with ckAHR1 homology models, all the natural ligands showed a interaction pattern that was distinct from that observed with anthropogenic DLCs, including TCDD. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the ckAHR1-ckARNT1 may be the most important dimerization pair in most tissues for regulating the physiological functions driven by natural ligands, although it was less reactive to TCDD.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of sublethal concentrations (0.3, 0.6 and 1.2 mg L-1) of the herbicide Ronstar on the hematology and some immune parameters in Clarias gariepinus juvenile (mean weight and length 58.72 +/- 2.46 g and 27.60 +/- 1.62 cm, respectively). The hematological and some immune parameters were studied for 21 days in a static renewal bioassay system in which the water and the herbicide were changed daily. The erythrocyte count, hemoglobin concentration (Hb), and packed cell volume (PCV) were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in the treatment groups. When compared with the control, there were significant (p < 0.05) leucocytosis, lymphocytosis, neutropenia and monocytopenia in the treatment groups. Both the mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were reduced ((p < 0.05) in the Ronstar-exposed fish. The result showed that the treated fish suffered hypochromic microcytic anemia. The total immunoglobulin and phagocytic indices (phagocytic capacity and phagocytic index) were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in the treatment groups. while the respiratory burst was significantly (p < 0.05) increased in the treatment groups. The result showed that exposure to Ronstar had adverse effects on the hematology and immunocompetency of the fish.

AB Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in water from Xiongan New Area was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), simultaneous with its risk assessment. The optimal extraction conditions, derivatization factors (such as derivation reagent amount, derivatization time and temperature), and dissolution solvent were determined by orthogonal experiment. These results indicated the optimum derivatization time and temperature were 70 degrees C and 30 min, respectively, whilst the amount of derivatization reagent (N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide) was 40 mu L. The optimum extraction efficiency was obtained when using the mixture of hexanedichloromethane (1:1, v:v) with salt concentration of 6 g/L. Using the sample of S9 as control, the recovery experiments were performed with three different spiked levels. The water samples of Baiyang Lake and Fuhe river were analyzed using the optimized conditions. Those results showed that the concentrations of TBBPA in samples ranged from 18.5 ng/L to 82.6 ng/L, which lies in the middle level of data previously published from other areas in China. The risk quotient (RQ) model was used to evaluate the above data. The results of exposure and risk assessment showed that the margin of exposure (MOE) was 1.28 x 10(7)-2.5 x 10(7) and the RQ(max) was 0.0266. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) standard and categories of RQ indicates that the estimated dietary exposure to TBBPA is unlikely to raise significant health concerns. This is the first report on the occurrence and risk assessment of TBBPA in waters from Xiongan New Area, which will be helpful for further risk assessment of other persistent organic pollutants. At present, the toxicological data of TBBPA in the biological body of Baiyang Lake is limited. In addition, more accurate and convenient approaches for the risk assessment of TBBPA should be explored.

AB The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is a challenge to the health of humans, animals and the environments. Human activities and aquatic environments can increase ARGs. Few studies have focused on the temporal variation of aquatic bacteria with multiple ARGs in aquatic environments affected by human production activity. We studied culturable bacteria (CB) carrying ARGs, including sul1, sul2, floR, strA and gyrA in the shrimp hepatopancreas (HP) and in pond water during shrimp culture. The relative abundance of ARGs carried by CB in HP was higher than that in water (P < 0.05). However, CB carrying ARGs generally varied in random pattern. The correlation of sul2 abundance was significantly positive in HP, while that of strA abundance was significantly negative in water (P < 0.05) during shrimp culture. Among all of the CB, 33.59% carried multiple ARGs. Temporal distance-decay analysis indicated that CB carrying ARGs in water were more resistant to the effects of human activity. CB carrying ARGs varied temporally in HP and pond water during shrimp culture. These results demonstrate that multiple ARGs are carried by CB, and these varied with the phase of aquatic culture.

SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
LA English
DT Letter
ID TOXICITY
AB The science of species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) is a blend of statistical theory, ecotoxicological testing, study reliability, and biodiversity. The utility of SSDs has been well reviewed and they are viewed as a high tier assessment tool in environmental risk assessment and other disciplines. SSDs seek to improve upon probabilistic extrapolation of laboratory (and sometimes field) collected ecotoxicity data for environmental protection by modeling the diversity of multiple experimental results in the form of a single statistical distribution which reduces or eliminates the need for extrapolation with deterministic assessment factors. SSDs thus depend heavily on both statistical and biological knowledge. In this commentary we review recently published literature identifying areas of improvement based on fundamental statistical theory or application in environmental assessment contexts. We reveal that sound application of SSDs relies heavily upon a grasp of probability distributions, how asymmetric confidence intervals are derived for distributions common to SSDs, the influence of sample size on parameter estimation, and how these are collectively applied across the myriad of regulatory systems globally. Statisticians and ecotoxicologists are inextricably bound together in the goal of actually improving hazard assessment using both probabilistic and deterministic methodologies.

AB Microorganism technologies can provide a potential alternative to traditional methods of removing heavy metals to conserve agricultural soils. This study aimed to identify and characterize heavy metals-resistant bacteria (HMRB) isolated from industry-affected soil and their desired impact as bioremediators of heavy metals-stressed spinach plants. Three of 135 isolates were selected based on a high level of resistance to heavy metals. Based on morphological and biochemical characteristics, the selected isolates were identified as Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii DSM 15029 T DSM (MA3), Paenibacillus jamilae DSM 13815 T DSM (LA22), or Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 1117 DSM (SN36). Experiments were implemented to investigate the three isolated HM-RB ability on improving attributes of growth, physio-biochemistry, and components of the antioxidant defense system of spinach plant exposed to the stress of cadmium (Cd2+; 2 mM), lead (Pb2+; 2 mM) or 2 mM Cd2++2 mM Pb2+. Compared to control, Cd2+ or Pb2+ stress markedly lowered plant fresh and dry weights, leaf contents of chlorophylls and carotenoids, rates of transpiration (Tr), net photosynthesis (Pn) and stomatal conductance (gs), relative water content (RWC), and membrane stability index (MSI). In contrast, contents of a.tochopherol (alpha.TOC), ascorbic acid (AsA), glutathione (GSH), proline, soluble sugars, Cd2+, and Pb2+, as well as activities of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants were markedly elevated. The application of HM-RB promoted the tolerance to heavy metal stress in spinach plants by improving Tr, Pn, gs, RWC, and MSI, while activities of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants were suppressed. These results reflected positively in promoting plant growth under heavy metal stress. Therefore, the application of HM-RB as potential bioremediators may be a promising strategy for promoting plant growth and productivity under heavy metal stress.

AB Turning biomass into biochar as a multifunctional carbon-based material for water remediation has attracted much research attention. Sawdust and rice husk were selected as feedstock for biochar (BC) production, aiming to explore their performance as a catalyst to activate persulfate (PS) for degrading acid orange 7 (AO7). There was an excellent synergistic effect in the combined BC/PS system. Sawdust biochar (MX) showed a faster and more efficient performance for the AO7 degradation due to its abundant oxygen functional groups, compared to rice husk biochar (DK). In the BC/PS system, AO7 was well decolorized and mineralized. Based on the two-dimensional correlation analysis method, the azo conjugation structure and naphthalene ring of AO7 molecule changed first then benzene ring changed during the reaction. Moreover, AO7 decolorization efficiency increased with the increase of PS concentration and biochar dosage, and the deacrease of pH. Biochar deactivated after used twice. When the biochar reached its adsorption equilibrium of AO7, the AO7 could not be degraded in the BC/PS system. SO4-center dot and OH center dot participated in the reaction together and OH center dot played the main role in activating PS to AO7 decolorization based on the radical scavengers experiment. All of results indicate using biochar to activate PS for degradation of AO7 contaminated water is a promising method.

AB The relationship between the chemical forms of Cu2+ and Cd2+ adsorbed on the roots of different wheat cultivars and their phytotoxic effects on the plants were investigated. The wheat varieties Dunmaiwang (DMW), Tekang 6 (TK6), Zhongmai895 (ZM895), and Chaojixiaomai (AK68) were used. The zeta potentials of wheat roots, measured by the streaming potential method, were used to characterize root charge properties. Results indicated that the changes in zeta potential at pH 4.01-6.61 were 14.7, 15.53, 13.01, and 12.06 mV for ZM895, AK68, DMW, and TK6, respectively. The negative charge and functional groups on ZM895 and AK68 roots were greater than on DMW and TK6 roots, which led to more exchangeable and complexed Cu2+ and Cd2+ on ZM895 and AK68 roots and increased Cu2+ and Cd2+ toxicity compared to DMW and TK6. Coexisting cations, such as Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and NH4+, alleviated Cu2+ and Cd2+ toxicity to wheat roots through competition for adsorption sites on the roots, which decreased exchangeable and complexed Cu2+ and Cd2+ on wheat roots. The Ca2+ and Mg2+ were most effective in alleviating heavy metal toxicity and they decreased exchangeable Cu2+ on AK68 roots by 39.14% and 47.82%, and exchangeable Cd2+ by 8.51% and 28.23%, respectively.

AB The objective of the study was to explore the influences of arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM), phosphorus (P) fertiliser, biochar application (BC) and their interactions on Medicago sativa growth, nutrient, Cd content and AM fungi-plant symbioses. Applications of both P fertiliser and BC significantly increased total biomass and P and potassium (K) uptake, regardless of AM. When no P fertiliser or BC was used, the shoot biomass and nitrogen (N), P, and K contents in the +AM treatments were 1.39, 1.54, 4.53 and 2.06 times higher than those in the -AM treatments, respectively. AM fungi only elevated the total P uptake by 44.03% when P fertiliser was applied at a rate of 30 mg P kg(-1) in the absence of BC addition. With BC application or high-P fertiliser input (100 mg P kg(-1)), the soil available P was significantly higher than that in the other treatments, and AM fungi significantly reduced the shoot biomass. The minimum Cd concentration occurred in the shoots of alfalfas treated with BC and high-P fertiliser inputs; this concentration was lower than the maximum permitted concentration in China. Although the BC and high-P inputs could eliminate the positive mycorrhizal response, the results suggested that BC application in combination with high-P fertiliser input could not only increase forage yields but also lower Cd concentrations to meet the forage safety standards by the dilution effect.

AB Bioindicator organisms are important tools in environmental monitoring studies. Understanding this, the overall goal of the present study was to evaluate the sensitivity and viability of the native fish species Banded tetra, (Astyanax aeneus; Giinther, 1860), widely spread in the aquatic ecosystems of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, as a bioindicator organism. In order to do this, we performed a bioassay at sublethal concentrations using copper (CuSO4) to experimentally evaluate and validate the relationship between the trace metals and oxidative stress biomarkers response Rcatalase (CAT), lipoperoxidation content (LPO)], detoxification Rglutathione S-transferase (GST), metallothionein content (MT)] and neurotoxicity (AChE) in muscle of A. aeneus. Results showed changes in biomarkers after 96 h: Catalase activity (CAT) was significantly higher above 1.5 and 2 mg/L (154.35 and 172.50% increase, respectively); lipid peroxidation contents (TBARS), GST activity, and MT content were very similar to CAT activity at 1.5 and 2 mg/L of Cu. In terms of neurotoxicity, AChE activity was significantly inhibited at 0.1 mg/L (64%; p < 0.001) and 0.5 mg/L (44%; p < 0.001) of Cu. Based on the bioassay results, we performed a trace metal monitoring campaign in muscle of A. aeneus caught in 15 sites with different anthropogenic activities, during the summer of 2017, to establish a baseline of trace metals pollution in the state of Campeche. A. aeneus showed the highest trace metal accumulation in the following order: Al > Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > Hg > Cr > Pb > Cd > V > As, while sites were arrange as follows: Xnoha lagoon > Palizada River > Candelaria River > Ululmal > Maravillas > Lopez Mateos. PCA showed a cluster between biomarkers (GST, CAT, TBARS, and MT) and concentration of metals (Cd, Cu, Fe, Zn, Hg and Cr). Conversely, AChE inhibition was not related to a specific metal, but highest inhibitions (> 50%) were present in those sites with intensive agricultural practices. These results determined that, based on its physiological response and trace metal bioaccumulation, Astyanax aeneus can be considered a good bioindicator for evaluating the presence of trace metals in tropical aquatic systems of the Yucatan Peninsula.

AB Background: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exposure has been shown to be a risk factor for many diseases. However, studies on the association between PAHs exposure and kidney disease are limited. The aim of this study was to explore the association between urinary PAHs and albuminuria based on a national representative sample from the general U.S. population.
   Method: The data utilized were extracted from the 2003-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Eight urinary PAHs were detected as PAH metabolites (OH-PAHs). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied to examine the association between urinary OH-PAHs and urinary albumincreatinine ratio (ACR). All models were adjusted for confounding demographic, anthropometric and lifestyle factors.
   Result: A total of 8149 NHANES (2003-2014) participants with complete data were eligible. Compared with the lowest quartile, an increased prevalence of high ACR level ( > 3 mg/mmol) was observed in the participants with the highest quartile of 2-hydroxynaphthalene [OR (95% CI), 1.56 (1.28-1.90), P < 0.001], 3-hydroxyfluorene [OR (95% CI), 1.29 (1.06-1.58), P = 0.011] and 2-hydroxyfluorene [OR (95% CI), 1.47 (1.20-1.80), P < 0.001] levels after adjusting for confounding factors. In subgroup analysis, significantly high OH-PAHs leveland a strong relationship between OH-PAHs and ACR were observed in current smokers in the adjusted model.
   Conclusion: High levels of urinary OH-PAHs were positively associated with high levels of ACR in the U.S. population. Our finding provided evidence that PAHs exposure might potentially be related to albuminuria and therefore might have implications for environmental governance and prevention/treatment of this condition.

AB Pantoea agglomerans is gram-negative bacteria widely distributed in nature. It predominates in inhalable dust from grain, herbs, and flax, and was identified as the most important cause of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) in eastern Poland. To better understand the molecular mechanism of HP development studies focused on the interactions between P. agglomerans and alveolar epithelial cells as well as lung tissue with particular emphasis on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The studies were conducted on human normal lung epithelial NL20 cells and mice strain C57BL/6J. Cells and mice underwent chronic exposure to saline extract of P. agglomerans (SE-PA). Morphological changes were evaluated under light microscopy, the concentration of fibrosis markers was examined by the ELISA method, while the expression of genes involved in EMT was evaluated by RealTime PCR. During incubation with SE-PA epithelial cells underwent conversion and assumed fibroblast phenotype characterized by a decrease in epithelial cells markers (CDH1, CLDN1, JUP) and increase in mesenchymal cells markers (FN1, VIM, CDH2). Mice lungs collected after 14 days of SE-PA treatment revealed inflammation with marked lymphocytes infiltration. The intensified inflammatory process accompanied by increased proliferation of fibrous connective tissue was noted in mice lungs after 28 days of SE-PA exposure. Histological changes correlated with an increase of fibrosis markers (hydroxyproline, collagens), downregulation of epithelial markers (Cdh1, Cldn1, Jup, Ocln) and upregulation of myofibroblasts markers (Acta2, Cdh2, Fn1, Vim). Obtained results revealed SE-PA ability to induce EMT in human lung epithelial cells and mice lung tissue, with the scale of changes proportional to the time of treatment.

AB The current study aimed to examine, for the first time, the relationship between exposure to deltamethrin (DLM) and atherogenic lipid profile disorders in adult Wistar rats, as well as, to verify the mechanism of the beneficial role of Zygophyllum album leaves extracts (ZALE). The experimental study was assessed using DLM (4 mg/kg b.w) either alone or co administered with ZALE (400 mg/kg b.w) orally for 90 days in rats. RP-HPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF-MS was used to identify the bioactive metabolites present in ZALE. Plasmatic and aortic total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), native LDL (LDL-apo B-100) and oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) were evaluated using autoanalyzer and a sandwich ELISA, respectively. The protein expressions of LDLR (native LDL receptor) and CD36 (Scavenger receptor class B) were evaluated in aorta or liver with a Western blot. The pathology has been confirmed with lipid stain (Oil Red O). Phytochemicals analysis revealed the presence of fifteen saponins in ZALE. Rats intoxicated with DLM revealed a significant increase in plasmatic and aortic lipid profile (TC, LDL-C, LDL-apo B-100 and ox-LDL), as well as, the concentration of the plasmatic cytokines include TNF-alpha, IL-2 and IL-6, compared to control. Hepatic native LDL and aortic CD36 receptor expression were increased in DLM treated group, however aortic LDL-R does not present any modification, when compared to control. The detected disturbances in lipid parameters were supported by Oil Red O applied. Due to their antioxidant activity, the bioactive compounds in ZALE as powerful agents able to prevent the pro-atherogenic effect observed in DLMtreated animals. These metabolites modulated most of inflammatory markers, prevented accumulation of lipid and lipoprotein biomarkers, regulated the major receptor regulators of hepatic cholesterol metabolism, as well as normalize lipid distribution in liver and aorta tissue.

AB Many areas of the world are affected simultaneously by salinity and heavy metal pollution. Halophytes are considered as useful candidates in remediation of such soils due to their ability to withstand both osmotic stress and ion toxicity deriving from high salt concentrations. Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa WilId) is a halophyte with a high resistance to abiotic stresses (drought, salinity, frost), but its capacity to cope with heavy metals has not yet been fully investigated. In this pot experiment, we investigated phytoextraction capacity, effects on nutrient levels (P and Fe), and changes in gene expression in response to application of Cr(III) in quinoa plants grown on saline or non-saline soil. Plants were exposed for three weeks to 500 mg kg(-1) soil of Cr(NO3)(3)center dot 9H(2)O either in the presence or absence of 150 mM NaCl. Results show that plants were able tolerate this soil concentration of Cr (III); the metal was mainly accumulated in roots where it reached the highest concentration (ca. 2.6 mg g(-1) DW) in the presence of NaCl. On saline soil, foliar Na concentration was significantly reduced by Cr(III). Phosphorus translocation to leaves was reduced in the presence of Cr(III), while Fe accumulation was enhanced by treatment with NaCl alone. A real-time RT-qPCR analysis was conducted on genes encoding for sulfate, iron, and phosphate transporters, a phytochelatin, a metallothionein, glutathione synthetase, a dehydrin, Hsp70, and enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of proline (P5CS), glycine betaine (BADH), tocopherols (TAT), and phenolic compounds (PAL). Cr(III), and especially Cr(III)+NaCl, affected transcript levels of most of the investigated genes, indicating that tolerance to Cr is associated with changes in phosphorus and sulfur allocation, and activation of stress-protective molecules. Moderately saline conditions, in most cases, enhanced this response, suggesting that the halophytism of quinoa could contribute to prime the plants to respond to chromium stress.

AB Due to rapid advances in the era of electronic technologies, indium has played the important material for the production of liquid crystal display screens in the semiconductor and optoelectronic industries. The present study focuses on evaluating the toxic effects and related mechanisms of indium chloride (InCl3) on RAW264.7 macrophages. Cytotoxicity was induced by InCl3 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. InCl3 had the ability to induce macrophage death through apoptosis rather than through necrosis. According to the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis assay, InCl3 induced DNA damage, also called genotoxicity, in a concentration-dependent manner. Cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed protease (caspase)-3, -8, and 9 were activated by InCl3 in a concentration-dependent manner. Mitochondria dysfunction and cytochrome c release from the mitochondria were induced by InCl3 in a concentration-dependent manner. Downregulation of BCL2 and upregulation of BAD were induced by InCl3 in a concentration-dependent manner. More, we proposed that InCl3 treatment generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a concentration dependent manner. In conclusion, the current study revealed that InCl3 induced macrophage cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and genotoxicity via a mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway and ROS generation.

AB The modulatory role of the Spirulina platensis (SP) against furan-induced (FU) hepatic and renal damage was assessed in this study. For achieving this, sixty rats were distributed into six groups: control group, SP-administered group (300 mg/kg b.wt orally for 28 days), a FU-intoxicated group (16 mg/kg b.wt, orally, daily for 28 days), protective co-treated group SP/F (administered SP 300 mg/kg b.wt, one week before, and concurrently with FU intoxication), therapeutic co-treated group FU/SP (administered SP 300 mg/kg b.wt, one week after FU intoxication for 28 days) and protective/therapeutic co-treated group SP/FU/SP (administered SP one week before and after, concurrently with FU intoxication). Subsequently, the biochemical responses and the histology of hepatic and renal tissues in treated rats were assessed. The results indicated that FU intoxication induced a significant hepato- and nephropathy represented by the elevation in the values of tissue injury biomarkers and reduction in protein levels. Histologically, a wide range of morphological, cytotoxic, inflammatory, and vascular alterations as well as downregulation in the immunoexpression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the proliferation-associated nuclear antigen (Ki-67) were induced by FU intoxication. Oral SP administration, particularly in the protective/therapeutic co-treated group, markedly supressed the serum levels of the tissue injury biomarkers, diminished the inflammatory response, restored the cytotoxic alterations, upregulated the immunoexpression of PCNA and Ki-67, and restored the perturbed morphology of the hepatic and renal tissues. In conclusion, the obtained data demonstrated that SP co-administration elicits both protective and therapeutic potential against the FU-induced hepato- and nephropathy.

AB Laccases play a significant role in remedying dye pollutants. Most of these enzymes are originated from terrestrial fungi and bacteria, thus they are not proper to be used in the environments with neutral/alkaline pH, or they may require laborious extraction/purification steps. These limitations can be solved using marine spore laccases through high stability and easy to use application. In the current study, laccase activity of the marine spore-forming Bacillus sp. KC2 was measured according to the guaiacol and syringaldazine oxidation. Abiotic stresses like pH of 6, temperature of 37 degrees C and 0.3 mM CuSO4 (in comparison with optimal sporulation conditions: pH of 8, temperature of 20 degrees C and 0.0 mM CuSO4) enhanced laccase formation in sporal coat. Maximum activity of enzyme was observed at 50 degrees C and pH 7, which did not change in the alkaline pH and temperature range of 20-70 degrees C. Results indicated ions, inhibitors and solvent stability of the enzyme and its activity were stimulated by Co2+, Mn2+, PMSF, acetone, acetonitrile, ethanol, and methanol. The spore laccase could decolorize synthetic dyes from various chemical groups including azo (acid orange, amaranth, trypan blue, congo red, and amido black), indigo (indigo carmine), thiazine (methylene blue, and toluidine blue), and triarylmethane (malachite green) with ABTS/syringaldazine mediators after 5 h. Degradation products were not toxic against Sorghum vulgare and Artemia sauna model organisms. The enzyme mediator system showed high potentials for dye bioremediation over a wide range of harsh conditions.

AB Prosulfocarb (PSC) is a thiocarbamate herbicide mainly used in winter cereals and a relevant aerosol precursor under OH radicals (center dot OH) photooxidation conditions. We investigated the environmental risks, mechanisms, kinetics and products for the PSC with center dot OH by employing theoretical chemical calculations. Two reaction types of H-abstraction and center dot OH-addition reactions were taken into account. Whether in the atmosphere or aqueous particles, the most favorable pathway was the H-abstraction in the N-alkyl groups close to nitrogen atom. Subsequent reactions of primary intermediates were considered at different conditions. The total rate constants were determined as 2.62 x 10-10 cm(3) molecule-1 s-1 and 4.96 x 10-11 cm(3) molecule-1 s-1 at 298 K in atmosphere and aqueous particles, respectively. In natural water with the center dot OH concentration of 10-15-10-18 mol 1-1, the half-lives (t1/2) of PSC in the center dot OH-initiated reactions were calculated as t(1/2) = 2.40 x 10(4)-2.40 x 10(7) s. With regard to the influence on human health and the ecosystem, oxidized products of PSC were estimated to be mutagenicity negative and had no obvious bioaccumulation potential. The aquatic toxicity of PSC and its degradation products was evaluated and the assessment results showed that the degradation of PSC was a toxicityreduced process but they were still at toxic and harmful levels.

AB The biodegradation of dyes remains one of the biggest challenges of textile wastewater. Azo dyes are one of the most commonly employed dye classes, and biological treatment processes tend to generate recalcitrant aromatic amines, which are more toxic than the parent dye molecule. This study aimed to isolate bacterial strains with the capacity to degrade both the azo dye and the resulting aromatic amines towards the development of a simple and reliable treatment approach for dye-laden wastewaters. A mixed bacterial enrichment was first developed in an anaerobic-aerobic lab-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) fed with a synthetic textile wastewater containing the model textile azo dye Acid Red 14 (AR14). Eighteen bacterial strains were isolated from the SBR, including members of the Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Oerskovia genera, Oerskovia paurometabola presenting the highest decolorization capacity (91% after 24 h in static anaerobic culture). Growth assays supported that this is a facultative bacterium, and decolorization batch tests with 20-100 mg AR14 L-1 in a synthetic textile wastewater supplemented with yeast extract indicated that O. paurometabola has a high color removal capacity for a significant range of AR14 concentrations. In addition, a model typically used to describe biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds was adjusted to the results, to predict AR14 biodegradation time profiles at different initial concentrations. HPLC analysis confirmed that decolorization occurred through azo bond reduction under anaerobic conditions, the azo dye being completely reduced after 24 h of anaerobic incubation for the range of concentrations tested. Interestingly, partial (up to 63%) removal of one of the resulting aromatic amines (4-amino-naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid) was observed when subsequently subjected to aerobic conditions. Overall, this work showed the azo dye biodegradation potential of specific bacterial strains isolated from mixed culture bioreactors, reporting for the first time the decolorization capacity of an Oerskovia sp. with further biodegradation of a recalcitrant sulfonated aromatic amine metabolite.

AB Selenium (Se) is an essential element for human and animal, although considered beneficial to higher plants. Selenium application at high concentration to plants can cause toxicity decreasing the physiological quality of seeds. This study aimed to characterize the Se toxicity on upland rice yield, seed physiology and the localization of Se in seeds using X-ray fluorescence microanalysis (mu-XRF). In the flowering stage, foliar application of Se (0, 250, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 g ha(-1)) as sodium selenate was performed. A decrease in rice yield and an increase in seed Se concentrations were observed from 250 g Se ha(-1). The storage proteins in the seeds showed different responses with Se application (decrease in albumin, increase in prolamin and glutelin). There was a reduction in the concentrations of total sugars and sucrose with the application of 250 and 500 g Se ha(-1). The highest intensities K alpha counts of Se were detected mainly in the endosperm and aleurone/pericarp. mu-XRF revealed the spatial distribution of sulfur, calcium, and potassium in the seed embryos. The seed germination decreased, and the electrical conductivity increased in response to high Se application rates showing clearly an abrupt decrease of physiological quality of rice seeds. This study provides information for a better understanding of the effects of Se toxicity on rice, revealing that in addition to the negative effects on yield, there are changes in the physiological and biochemical quality of seeds.

AB Nano-titanium dioxide (nTiO(2)) has been reported to improve tolerance of plants against different environmental stresses by modulating various physiological and biochemical processes. Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to act as an important stress signaling molecule during plant responses to abiotic stresses. The present work was planned to investigate the involvement of endogenous NO in nTiO(2)-induced activation of defense system of fava bean (Vicia faba L.) plants under water-deficit stress (WDS) conditions. Water-suffered plants showed increased concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O-2 center dot(-)) content coupled with increased electrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation which adversely affected nitrate reductase (NR) activity, chlorophyll content and growth of the plants. However, application of 15 mg L-1 nTiO(2) to stressed plants significantly induced NR activity and synthesis of NO which elevated enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense system of the stressed plants and suppressed the generation of H2O2 and O-2 center dot(-) content, leakage of electrolytes, and lipid peroxidation. Application of nTiO(2), in association with NO, also enhanced the accumulation of osmolytes (proline and glycine betaine) that assisted the stressed plants in osmotic adjustment as witnessed by improved hydration level of the plants. Involvement of NO in nTiO(2)-induced activation of defense system was confirmed with NO scavenger cPTIO [2-(4-carboxypheny0-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide] which caused recurrence of WDS.

AB Microplastic debris is a prevalent global pollutant that poses a risk to marine organisms and ecological processes. It is also suspected to pose a risk to marine food security; however, these risks are currently poorly understood. In this review, we seek to understand the current knowledge pertaining to the contamination of commercially important fished and farmed marine organisms with microplastics, with the aim of answering the question "Does microplastic pollution pose a risk to marine food security?". A semi-systematic review of studies investigating the number of microplastics found in commercially important organisms of different trophic levels suggests that microplastics do not biomagnify, and that organisms at lower trophic levels are more likely to contaminated by microplastic pollution than apex predators. We address the factors that influence microplastic consumption and retention by organisms. This research has implications for food safety and highlights the risks of microplastics to fisheries and aquaculture, and identifies current knowledge gaps within this research field.

AB Gram-negative Citrobacter freundii with high Pd (II) reduction capacity was isolated from electroplating wastewater, and the electron transfer involved in Pd (II) bio-reduction by C. freundii JH was investigated in phosphate buffer saline solution with sodium formate as sole electron donor under anaerobic condition. FTIR spectra indicated that hydroxyl and amine groups on cell wall participated Pd (II) bio-sorption. TEM, XRD, XPS results confirmed that Pd (0) nanoparticles (NPs) could be bio-synthesized intra/extracellularly. Meanwhile, pH turnover were observed owing to the reduction of cytochrome c (c-Cyt) in bio-reduction process. EPR spectra indicated that free radicals (center dot OH) was generated from high concentration Pd (II), which would cause seriously damage to cell. Despite of the lower tolerance to Pd (II), the cells at logarithmic phase exhibited higher Pd (II) reduction capacity (72.21%) than that at stationary phase (56.21%), which might be related to the relatively stronger proton motive force (PMF) created by the substrate oxidation and the electron transfer, as evidenced by electrochemical experiments (CV, DPV, amperometric I-t curves) and protein denaturalization experiments. Additionally, c-Cyt and riboflavin were confirmed to be important participants in electron transfer. Finally, a putative synthesis mechanism of Pd (0)-NPs was deduced. This study contributed to further understanding the electron transfer in Pd (II) reduction, and provided more information for the bio-synthetic of metal nanoparticles.

AB Cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal, restrains the growth and development of plants and threatens global food safety. Many studies on the alleviation-of heavy metal toxicity by exogenous phytohormones have emerged, but reports on tea (Camellia sinensis) are still scarce. In this study, the effects of indole acetic acid (IAA) (2 mu M and 10 mu M) on Cd uptake and on the physiological and biochemical characteristics of the 'Xiangfeicui' tea cultivar were investigated for the first time. The order of Cd accumulation in tea seedlings was root > stem > mature leaf > tender leaf. Under Cd stress (30 mg kg(-1)), photosynthetic pigment levels, antioxidant enzyme activity, root vigor, root IAA content, and the levels of most metabolites (including caffeine, soluble sugar, total amino acids, some amino acid components, and most catechins) were significantly reduced, while levels of malondialdehyde, proline, epicatechin, and some amino acids increased. We therefore propose that by reducing Cd accumulation, exogenous IAA can lessen the adverse effects of Cd on the physiology and biochemistry of tea seedlings, promoting the growth of healthier tea plants.

AB Plants can play important roles in overcoming selenium (Se) deficiency and Se toxicity in various regions of the world. Selenite (SeIV), selenate (SeVI), as well as Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) naturally formed through reduction of SeIV, are the three main Se species in the environment. The bioaccumulation and transformation of these Se species in plants still need more understanding. The aims of this study are to investigate the phytotoxicity, accumulation, and transformation of SeIV, SeVI and SeNPs in garlic, a relatively Se accumulative plant. The spatial distribution of Se in the roots were imaged using synchrotron radiation micro-focused X-ray fluorescence (SR-mu XRF). The chemical forms of Se in different plant tissues were analyzed using synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (SR-XAS). The results demonstrate that 1) SeNPs which has the lowest phytotoxicity is stable in water, but prone to be converted to organic Se species, such as C-Se-C (MeSeCys) upon uptake by root. 2) SeIV is prone to concentrate in the root and incorporated into C-Se-C (MeSeCys) and C-Se-R (SeCys) bonding forms; 3) SeVI with the lowest transformation probability to organic Se species has the highest phytotoxicity to plant, and is much easier to translocate from root to leaf than SeNPs and SeIV. The present work provides insights into potential impact of SeNPs, selenite and selenate on aquatic-plant ecosystems, and is beneficial for systematically understanding the Se accumulation and transformation in food chain.

AB Cultivar-dependent cadmium (Cd) accumulation was principal in developing Cd-pollution safe cultivars (PSCs). Proteins related to different Cd accumulations of the low-Cd-accumulating (SJ19) and high-Cd-accumulating (CX4) cultivars were investigated by iTRAQ analysis. Higher Cd bioaccumulation factors and translocation factor in CX4 than in SJ19 were consistent with the cultivar-dependent Cd accumulations. The Cd uptake was promoted in CX4 due to its higher expression of Cd-binding proteins and the lower expression of Cd-efflux proteins in roots. What's more, significantly elevated thiol groups (PC2 and PC3) in CX4 under Cd stress might contribute to the high Cd accumulation in roots and the root-to-shoot translocation of Cd-PC complex. Up-regulated proteins involved in cellulose biosynthesis and pectin de-esterification in SJ19 enhanced the Cd sequestration of root cell walls, which was considered as the predominant strategy for reducing Cd accumulation in shoots. The present study provided novel insights in the cultivar-dependent Cd accumulation in shoots of B. parachinensis.

AB Drought stress is one of the extreme effects of climate change causing large losses in production of crop plants. The risk of recurrent droughts has increased in next decades hence, the development of shot-gun, inexpensive and effective approaches is essential to ensure high yield of crops in drought-prone areas of the world. Exogenous application of nutrients such as potassium (K) has been reported to increase abiotic resistance and improve yield in crops however, knowledge regarding interaction of K with osmoprotectants like chitosan (Ct) still remains elusive. Here, we report the effects of individual or combined K (using K2SO4 as a source) or Ct application on growth, physiological processes and antioxidative defense system of sunflower under drought stress. At first, various doses of K (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 g/l) and Ct (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 g/l) were foliar applied to evaluate their role in improving plant biomass, water status and total chlorophyll in drought-induced seedlings of sunflower. The optimized K (11.48 g/l) and Ct (0.28 g/l) doses were further tested in second experiment to understand the underlying mechanisms of drought tolerance. Foliar K + Ct spray markedly enhanced the leaf gas exchange characteristics, increased proline, soluble proteins, and free amino acids, upregulated antioxidant defense system and helped to maintain plant water status in sunflower exposed to drought stress. The impact of drought stress was more pronounced at vegetative than reproductive stage and positive effects of combined K and Ct application were related to improved physiological and metabolic processes to improve yield and quality of sunflower under drought stress.

AB Drought and nitrogen (N) deposition are important components of global climate and environmental change. In this greenhouse study, we investigated the ecophysiological responses of the seedlings of three subtropical forest plant species (Schirna superba, Castanopsis fissa, and Michelia macclurei) to short-term experimental drought stress, N addition, and their interaction. The results showed that drought stress reduced the activities of antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT)] and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), but increased the malondialdehyde (MDA), abscisic acid (ABA), and proline (PRO) contents in plants. The PRO content, T-AOC, and antioxidant enzyme activities were increased, and ABA and MDA contents were decreased by N addition alone. Furthermore, N addition under drought stress increased antioxidant enzymes activities, PRO content, and T-AOC. The treatments, however, did not significantly affect the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of the species. T-AOC was positively correlated with antioxidant enzyme activities in each species, indicating that antioxidant enzymes were important for plant resistance to oxidative stress. MDA content increased with the increase of ABA content, indicating that ABA may help regulate stomatal movement and drought-induced oxidative injury in plants. T-AOC was positively correlated with PRO content, probably because PRO participated in osmotic regulation of cells and increased osmotic stress resistance. These results indicate that N addition can reduce drought stress of subtropical forest plants and will help researchers predict how evergreen broad-leaved forests will respond to global change in the future.

AB In this study we focused on Physella acuta, an alien snail species in order to determine their ability of bioaccumulation of heavy metals in their shells, bodies, the difference in accumulation in relation to age classes, and the influence of ecological variables on the community composition and density. On the basis of the results of ecological, toxicological, and experimental analyses we aimed to study the potential invasive features of P. acuta in comparision with the native species Stagrticola palustris. The content of Cu and Zn in the substratum and ammonia in the water was strongly related to the patterns of distribution of P. acuta. The content of Cd, Pb, and Cu in the shell fraction was always significantly lower than in the body fraction. A comparison of accumulation with respect to the size classes of P. acuta indicated that the lowest metal concentration in the body was typical for the largest individuals, except for Zn. Metal content in the bodies of the native species did not differ from the content measured in their analogous group of the largest individuals of P. acuta. The lowest value of bioaccumulation factor (BAF) was found for the large class of specimens of this species for each metal. A distinct decrease in the value of BAF in relation to the size of snails was found for cadmium. A 100% hatching success found in masses collected from pond confirmed the high reproductive potential of P. acuta which can be a factor that promotes its invasive features following its ability to occur in very high densities, but not necessarily the ability of metal accumulation in the body. Physella acuta can be used as a model organism in the studies on the accumulation of heavy metals however, the extend of accumulation can differ among the age classes. Because of the high tolerance of P. acuta to heavy metal pollution, in the future this species can be found in significantly polluted habitats, inhabiting free ecological niches, and occurring in high densities in snail communities.

AB Perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) has been widely used in production of many daily necessities because of its special nature. Althoughtoxic effects of PFDA to organisms have been reported, there is little research on the genotoxicity induced by oxidative stress of PFDA on the cellular and molecular levels simultaneously. Thus, we investigated the DNA oxidative damage caused by PFDA in mouse hepatocytes. On the cellular level, an increase in ROS content indicated that PFDA caused oxidative stress in mouse hepatocytes. In addition, after PFDA exposure, the comet assay confirmed DNA strand breaks and an increased 8-OHdG content demonstrated DNA oxidative damage. On the molecular level, the microenvironment of aromatic amino acids, skeleton and secondary structure of catalase (CAT) were varied after PFDA exposure and the enzyme activity was reduced because PFDA bound near the heme groups of CAT. Moreover, PFDA was shown to interact with DNA molecule by groove binding. This study suggests that PFDA can cause genotoxicity by inducing oxidative stress both on the cellular and molecular levels.

AB Paspaltun distichum L. was tested to evaluate its ability to phytoremediate mercury (Hg) contaminated soil over a 60-d period by analysis of the total Hg concentrations in roots and leaves. Hg concentration in Hg-contamination soil decreased by 70.0 mu g g(-1) after 60 day of grass cultivation and Hg was readily taken up by the roots (4.51 +/- 1.90 mu g g(-1)) rather than the leaves (0.35 +/- 0.02 mu g g(-1)). In addition, a comparative proteomic study was performed to unravel the protein expression involved in the Hg stress response in P. distichum L. A total of 49 proteins were classified as differentially proteins in the roots by the 'top three' proteomic analysis, of which 32 were up-regulated and 17 down-regulated in response to Hg stress. These changed proteins were classified by gene ontology analysis into five complex molecular functions involving photosynthesis and energy metabolism (31%), oxidative stress (14%), protein folding (16%), sulfur compound metabolism (10%), metal binding, and ion transport (29%). Moreover, the protein expression patterns were consistent with the metabolism pathway results. Overall, the results contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the Hg response in P. distichum and we propose a theoretical basis for the phytoremediation of Hg-contaminated soils.

AB Iron nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used for the removal of arsenic from water. In this study, we evaluated the interaction between arsenate (AsO43-) and Fe2O3-NPs on early seedling growth of Vigna radiata. Seedlings were raised in AsO43- and Fe2O3-NPs, alone and in combination. While Fe2O3-NPs slightly promoted seedling growth, AsO43- reduced seedling growth drastically. AsO43--induced decline in the seedling growth was recovered by Fe2O3-NPs. In contrast, equivalent concentrations of FeCl3, alone and together with AsO43-, inhibited seed germination completely. Lower arsenic content in seedlings raised in the presence of Fe2O3-NPs indicated that Fe2O3-NPs restricted arsenic uptake. Ability of Fe2O3-NPs to restrict the arsenic uptake of the seedlings was due to adsorption of AsO43-, as revealed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Non-toxic levels of iron in seedlings were due to restriction of Fe2O3-NPs to root-surface. AsO43- enhanced the ferric chelate reductase activity of root which was recovered by Fe2O3-NPs. The AsO43--induced oxidative stress, evident from high levels of proline, H2O2 and malondialdehyde, and lowered root oxidisability was ameliorated by Fe2O3-NPs. AsO43- induced enhancement in total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, and decline in guaiacol peroxidase activity were antagonized by Fe2O3-NPs. Our findings reveal that Fe2O3-NPs provide effective resistance/amelioration to arsenic toxicity by reducing arsenic availability to plants.

AB Vinasses obtained from the distillation of winemaking by-products (WDV) are complex effluents with variable physicochemical properties. Frequently, WDVs are used to irrigate agricultural soil, and/or discharged into aquatic bodies, which may result in serious environmental pollution, due to the presence of organic acids and recalcitrant compounds (polyphenols, tannins and metals). The present study aimed to evaluate the toxicity impact of an untreated WDV on terrestrial and aquatic organisms, at different levels of biological organization. The effluent was collected at the distillation column exit and characterized according to several physicochemical properties. The WDV potential phytotoxicity was assessed by germination inhibition assays on six agricultural crops, and its acute toxicity was assessed on Aliivibrio fisheri (microtox assay), Daphnia magna neonates (fresh-water crustacean), and zebrafish Danio rerio (fish embryo toxicity test, FET).
   The WDV presented a low pH (3.88), high levels of electrical conductivity, ECond (6.36 dS m(-1)) and salinity (3.3 ppt), besides high level of potassium (2.1 g L-1) and organic compounds (TOC = 17.7 g L-1), namely polyphenols (1.7 g L-1). The diluted WDV displayed variable inhibitory effects on the plant endpoints (percentage of inhibition of germination and radicle elongation and germination index). Overall, plants' susceptibility to increasing concentrations of WDV were differential (onion approximate to garden cress >= tomato > lettuce > maize > green beans) and the germination index EC55 varied from 10.9 to 64.4% v/v. Also, the acute negative effects toward aquatic organisms were determined, decreasing from the more complex organism to the simpler one: zebrafish embryos (96 h-LC50 = 0.34% v/v) > D. magna (48 h-LC50 = 4.8% v/v) > A. fisheri (30min-EC50 = 7.0% v/v). In conclusion, the findings suggest that WDVs might have a high toxicological impact on both terrestrial plants and aquatic organisms, even at high dilution levels, reinforcing the need for appropriate treatments before considering its discharge or reuse.

AB The aim of this study is to understand the levels and behaviour of the herbicide propoxycarbazone in environmental compartments, which are poorly characterized considering degradation products that might reach either surface water as groundwater or soil samples. To this end, an analytical method, based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS), has been developed to determine the parent compound and its transformation products in soils and water. In addition, a set of laboratory trials has been designed to address the dissipation process of propoxycarbazone formulation in both environmental substrates. The study revealed that the dissipation in water followed a first order kinetics and a non-linear "First Order Multi Compartment" model (FOMC) to soil.
   Relevant advances have been also achieved in terms of the analytical methodology, as far as the UHPLC-Orbitrap-MS technique allows the development of a retrospective screening of pesticide transformation products in water and soils. For this purpose, an accurate-mass database has been built and used for the post-run screening analysis with 9 transformation products. Photodegradation presumably plays an important role in the dissipation of propoxycarbazone. The results of UHPLC-Orbitrap-MS revealed that four transformation products were formed during the degradation process of the herbicide.

AB Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), as an environmental gas pollutant, has harmful effects on many tissues and organs, including myocardium. However, the underlying mechanisms of H2S-induced myocardia toxicity remain poorly understood. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of H2S on myocardia injury in broilers from the perspective of apoptosis. 30 ppm H2S was administered in the broiler chamber for 2, 4 and 6 week, respectively, and the myocardial samples in control groups and H2S groups were collected immediately after euthanized broilers. Transmission electron microscope, test kits, qRT-PCR and western blot were performed. Results showed that H2S exposure decreased the activities of catalase (CAT) and total antioxidant capability (TAOC), whereas the content of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) enhanced. Besides, we found the excessive expression of mitochondrial fission genes (Drp1 and Mff) by H2S, the dynamic balance of mitochondrial fission and fusion is destroyed. Furthermore, the levels of proapoptotic gene (including CytC, Cas3, Cas8, Cas9, TNF-alpha and Bax) increased after H2S exposure, as well as the expression level of anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 decreased. At the same time, the activities of ATPase (including Na+-K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, Mg2+-ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase) weakened under H2S exposure. Therefore, we conclude that H2S induced oxidative stress and then leaded to excessive mitochondrial fission, which involved in apoptosis and damage broiler myocardia.

AB Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is an important way to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, and is extensively involved in plant stress responses. However, the systematic roles of APA regulation in response to abiotic and biotic stresses in rice at the genome scale remain unknown. To take advantage of available RNA-seq datasets, using a novel tool APAtrap, we identified thousands of genes with significantly differential usage of polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites in response to the abiotic stress (drought, heat shock, and cadmium) and biotic stress [bacterial blight (BB), rice blast, and rice stripe virus (RSV)]. Genes with stress responsive APA dynamics commonly exhibited higher expression levels when their isoforms with short 3'-untranslated region (3' UTR) were more abundant. The stress-responsive APA events were widely involved in crucial stress-responsive genes and pathways: e.g. APA acted as a negative regulator in heat stress tolerance; APA events were involved in DNA repair and cell wall formation under Cd stress; APA regulated chlorophyll metabolism, being associated with the pathogenesis of leaf diseases under RSV and BB challenges. Furthermore, APA events were found to be involved in glutathione metabolism and MAPK signaling pathways, mediating a crosstalk among the abiotic and biotic stress-responsive regulatory networks in rice. Analysis of large-scale datasets revealed that APA may regulate abiotic and biotic stress-responsive processes in rice. Such post-transcriptome diversities contribute to rice adaption to various environmental challenges. Our study would supply useful resource for further molecular assisted breeding of multiple stress-tolerant cultivars for rice.

AB Heavy metals, especially gaseous heavy metals, have high toxicity and do harm to human. Heavy metal volatilization characteristics of co-combusted municipal solid wastes (MSW) and sewage sludge (SS) from different mass fraction of MSW and SS, different temperature and different O-2 concentration atmosphere was investigated. Performance of calcium-based sorbents was also studied. Volatilization efficiency of As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in MSW was 100%, 45.89%-66.58%, 75.62%-92.45%, 42.33%-65.70%, 39.25%-68.76% and 53.57%-84.62%, and that in SS was 28.37%-40.75%, 33.78%-43.42%, 46.08%-56.69%, 35.04%-51.52%, 18.54%-44.99% and 14.72%-48.88%. Volatilization efficiency of heavy metals increased as mass fraction of SS in a blend decreased and as temperature increased. Volatilization efficiency of all heavy metals examined decreased as O-2 concentration increased at high temperature and that of Cu, Pb and Zn increased as O-2 concentration increased at low temperature. CaO, Ca(OH)(2) and CaCO3 declined the volatilization of As, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn, while enhanced that of Pb. With calcium-based sorbents, volatilization efficiency of As, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn decreased from 70.06%, 39.91%, 75.52%, 44.08% and 40.10% to 54.24%, 33.73%, 39.98%, 20.56% and 32.06%, while that of Pb increased from 47.23% to 100%. Fitting formula was set to predict the heavy metals volatilization, and risk evaluation of gaseous heavy metals was exhibited.

AB Telomeres are DNA protein structures that protect chromosome ends from degradation and fusion, which are shortened by oxidative stress, for example air pollution including benzene, toluene, Coke Oven Emissions (COEs), and so on. As a biomarker of health and disease, telomere length is associated with cardiovascular, diabetes and cancers. The aim of this study was to estimate the effects of COEs exposure on telomere length and the benchmark dose (BMD) of COEs. A total of 542 coke oven workers and 235 healthy controls without exposure to toxicants were recruited. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the telomere length in human peripheral blood leukocytes DNA. Propensity scoring was used to match coke oven workers to healthy controls. Linear regression models and trend tests were used to the relationship between COEs exposure and telomere length. Telomere length in COEs exposed group 0.764 (0.536, 1.092) was significantly shorter than that in the control group 1.064(0.762, 1.438), (P < 0.001). There were significantly dose-response relationships between COEs exposure and telomere damage with telomere length as a biomarker. A BMDL value lower than the present occupational exposure limits (OELs) of COEs exposure was evaluated using the BMD approach in coke oven workers. Our results suggested that shorter telomere length is related to occupational exposure to COEs and the level of COEs exposure lower than the current national OELs in China and many other countries could induce telomere damage.

AB Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants, while their correlations with delta N-15 values and fatty acids (FAs) in fish tissues remain largely unexplored. In the present study, six species of fish for daily consumption were collected from Dongting Lake, and they were dissected to tissue samples to analyze the delta N-15 values, FM and OCPs. The results showed that the delta N-15 values of fish were ranked in the same order in different fish tissues. The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) had a different distribution pattern in fish tissues, while the saturated fatty acid (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were not. The composition of HCHs in fish tissues exhibited a tissue-specific and species-specific manner, while such pattern was not detected for DDTs. The correlation analysis indicated that the ratio of DHA/EPA was increased with the increase of delta N-15 value in the muscle, liver, gill, skin and intestine, indicating the substance flow in freshwater ecosystem. In addition, there were significant positive correlations between the concentrations of some PUFAs and OCPs in the muscle, suggesting that people should pay attention to co-intake of OCPs when they supplemented the PUFAs needed by the human body through fish.

AB Despite the increasing use of pesticides in tropical countries, research and legislative efforts have focused on their temperate counterparts. This paper presents a review of the literature on environmental risk assessment of pesticides for tropical terrestrial agroecosystems. It aims at evaluating potential differences in pesticide risk between temperate and tropical regions as well as to highlight research needs in the latter. Peculiarities of pesticide risks in tropical terrestrial agroecosystems are discussed in subsections 1) agricultural practices; 2) research efforts; 3) fate and exposure; 4) toxicity testing methods; and 5) sensitivity. The intensive and often inadequate pesticide application practices in tropical areas are likely to result in a relatively greater pesticide exposure in edge-of-field water bodies. Since pesticide fate may be different under tropical conditions, tropical scenarios for models estimating predicted environmental pesticide concentrations should be developed. Sensitivity comparisons do not indicate a consistent similar, greater or lower relative sensitivity of tropical soil organisms as compared to temperate organisms. However, several methods and procedures for application in the tropics need to be developed, which include: 1) identifying and collecting natural soils to be used as reference test substrates in tests; 2) identifying and discerning the range of sensitivity of native test species to soil contaminants; 3) developing test guidelines applicable to tropical/subtropical conditions; and 4) developing methods and procedures for higher tier testing for full development and implementation of environmental risk assessment schemes.

AB The mechanism of improving pyrene (PYR)-degrading ability of bacteria CP13 in Layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly chitosan/alginate (CHI/ALG) bio-microcapsules was investigated. Flow cytometry analysis showed that LBL microcapsules could effectively slow down the increasing rate of bacterial cell membrane permeability and the decreasing rate of the membrane potential, so as to reduce the death rate and number of the cells, which could protect the degrading bacteria. The results of Fluorescence spectrum, circular dichroism (CD) spectrum and laser light scattering (LLS) analysis revealed that the other possible mechanism for LBL microcapsules to promote bacterial degradation were following: CHI could enter the secondary structure of the protein of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from CP13 and combined with EPS to generate a stable ground material, which had larger molecular weight (3.76 x 10(6) g mol(-1)) than the original EPS (2.52 x 10(6) g mol(-1)). The combination of CHI and EPS resulted in the decrease of the density of EPS from 1.18 to 0.72 g L-1 suggesting that CHI can loosen the EPS configurations, improving the capture ability of bacteria for PYR as well as the mass transfer of PYR from the extracellular to intracellular, thus eventually promoting the bacteria degrade performance.

AB Ozone (O-3) can cause oxidative stress in plants and humans. Catechin is an antioxidant that enriches tea and can probably increase O-3 tolerance in plants. To investigate the mechanism of catechin to alleviate O-3 stress in plants, Zamiocalcus zamiifolia (an efficient plant for O-3 phytoremediation) was sprayed with 5 mM catechin and was used to expose O-3 (150-250) under long-term operation (10 cycles). We investigated whether exogenous catechin could enhance O-3 removal and alleviate O-3 stress through a balanced redox state in plants. Z. zamiifolia sprayed with catechin exhibited higher O-3 removal (80.27 +/- 3.12%), than Z. zamiifolia without catechin (50.03 +/- 2.68%). O-3 in the range of 150-250 ppb led to stress in plants, as shown by an increased malondialdehyde content (MDA) and salicylic acid (SA). Whereas under the presence of O-3, exogenous catechin could maintain the MDA content and inhibit SA accumulation. Under Z. zamiifolia+ catechin +O-3 conditions, catechin reacted with O-3, which led to the formation of catechin-quinone. The formation of catechin-quinone was confirmed by the depletion of reduced glutathione content (GSH). This catechin-quinone could induce GST and APX genes that are up-regulated approximately 35- and 5-fold, respectively. Hence, Z. zamiifolia+ catechin + O-3 conditions had higher performance for coping with oxidative stress than did Z. zamiifolia +O-3 conditions. This evidence demonstrates that catechin could enhance O-3 removal through a balanced redox state in plant cells. Finally, the application of tea extract for enhanced O-3 removal is also shown in this study.

AB This study aimed to compare the hematologic variables and pro-inflammatory biomarkers in urban adults living in Tabriz, Iran, facing various levels of outdoor volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Of all 219 people (212 male and 7 female), 71 were from the low traffic area and 148 were from high traffic and industrial areas. To validate the exposure levels, 93 air samples were taken to determine the target VOCs (benzene, toluene, xylenes, and styrene collectively called BTXS) concentrations in the studied areas. ANOVA and Tukey's tests were used for statistical analysis. Based on the results, significant differences were observed between the mean concentrations of BTXS with the following order of abundance: industrial > high traffic > low traffic. The Considerable decrease was observed in red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin, hematocrit, and eosinophils of 0.324 (x 10(6)/mu L), 0.57 g/dL, 1.87%, and 0.17 (x 10(3)/mu L), respectively in industrial area participants as compared to the low traffic area. However, a significant increase was observed in white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophils number, neutrophils percent, TNF-alpha and INF-gamma of 0.88 (x 10(3)/mu L), 0.80 (x 10(3)/mu L), 3.53%, 34.2 ng/mL, and 40.06 ng/mL, respectively in the same groups. The comparison of low and high traffic areas showed significant differences in RBC (p = 0.034), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) (p < 0.001), and interferon gamma (INF-gamma) (p < 0.001). On the contrary, no significant difference was observed in TNF-alpha and INF-gamma among the high traffic and industrial areas. In conclusion, the results showed that the samples from high traffic and industrial areas were regularly exposed to higher values of BTXS due to traffic and industrial pollutants as compared to the samples residing in low traffic regions. Based on the results living in both high traffic and industrial regions can increase adverse effects on hematologic parameters and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

AB TCS [5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol] caused a concentration dependent delay in embryonic development, delay and decline in hatching and reduction in length and weight of hatchlings along with an increase in abnormal/deformed embryos and larvae and percent mortality. These parameters varied in a species specific manner and increased with TCS residue in body. The 96 h LC50 values of TCS for Cyprinus carpio, Ctenopharyngodon idella, Labeo rohita and Cirrhinus mrigala were estimated at 0.315, 0.116, 0.096 and 0.131 mg/L, respectively. Hatching got delayed by 16.33 h for C. carpio (0.47 and 0.50 mg/L TCS) and C. idella (0.20 mg/L TCS) but by 18.07 h for L. rohita (0.15 mg/L TCS) and by 19.33 h for C. mrigala (0.18 mg/L TCS). Spine malformations, oedema (yolk sac and cardiac) and deflated swim bladder were present in 100% larvae of C. carpio, C. idella, L. rohita and C. mrigala at 0.30, 0.08, 0.13 and 0.14 mg/L TCS, respectively. TCS also caused hemorrhage (all but C. idella, only 3.33%), albinism and deformed caudal fin (C. idella), hypopigmentation and rupturing of yolk sac (C. mrigala), gas bubble disease (C. mrigala and L. rohita), fusion of eyes (C. carpio) and degeneration of digestive tract (L. rohita) in 10-40% hatchlings. Exposed hatchlings were very weak and paralyzed, could not swim and remained settled at the bottom of jars. Embryonic development was observed to be an early indicator of the toxicity of TCS as oedema and bubbles in yolk were observed in 40-100% embryos/hatchlings at 0.08 mg/L TCS while 100% mortality was observed between 0.15 and 0.50 mg/L TCS. L. rohita was most sensitive and C. carpio was least sensitive to the stress of TCS. Accumulation of TCS in the hatchlings (1/10 of TCS in water) after 96 h exposure hints that even small quantities of TCS may change species diversity in natural waters.

AB Artemia cysts have a huge economic importance for the aquaculture sector due to the fact that they are used as live feed for larviculture. Microplastics (MPs) are common and emergent pollutants in the aquatic environments, with unknown and potential long-term effects on planktonic species such as Anemia spp. When used as live feed, Artemia could transfer contaminants to fish along the food chain, with possible adverse effects on human health through their consumption. This study aims to assess the uptake of different concentrations of spherical polymer microparticles (FRM) (1-5 mu m diameter) and their associated chronic effects on feeding, growth, mortality, and reproductive success from juvenile to adult stage of brine shrimp Artemia franciscana. Individuals were exposed for 44 days to 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg.L-1 of FRM. No significant detrimental effects on growth, ingestion and mortality rates of A. franciscana were observed in all tested conditions. However, reproductive success was strongly affected by the increase of MP concentrations. The results of the present study showed that A. franciscana juveniles and adults were able to survive different experimental MP concentrations, but their reproductive success and progeny were significantly impacted by exposure to FRM particles.

AB Proper and economical treatments of wastewater are among the important and potential solutions to increase the water budget. Although mineral ores are barriers of potentially toxic metal contaminants; however to what extent, can these ores stand successfully for decontaminating waters polluted with Cs or Sr is the question of the current study. Therefore a trial was carried out on some of these ores i.e. kaolinite, montmorillonite, and illite, to investigate their effects as decontaminants for waters polluted with either 50 mu g Cs L-1 or 50 mu g Sr L-1. Results showed that sorption of Cs and Sr increased with decreasing the ratio of the applied sorbents to the quantities of contaminated waters. Such a finding was more obvious when the rate of the sorbent: water was only 1 g L-1. The highest sorption was attained by montmorillonite followed by kaolinite, then Illite. Thus, montmorillonite was selected to complete the sorption studies at a rate of 1 g L-1. Sorption of both Cs and Sr and consequently their removal efficiencies increased with increasing the pH of the sorbents-contaminated waters suspensions up to 7 beyond which significant reductions occurred. Also, increasing the temperature of the suspension resulted in significant increases in the removal efficiencies of the investigated sorbents. Only 120 min were enough to attain the highest removal efficiency. Moreover, Ca-salts could successfully substitute sorbed Cs and Sr on surfaces of the montmorillonite used previously for decontamination of these elements from waters. Accordingly, this mineral ore can be reused successively for further decontamination processes.

AB The effluent produced during hydraulic fracturing (i.e. flowback and produced water; FPW), is a complex hyper-saline solution that is known to negatively impact the survival and the fitness of the water flea Daphnia magna, but to date effects on behavior are unstudied. In the current study, the effects of FPW on phototactic behavior of D. magna were examined. Exposure of naive animals to FPW resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the speed of appearance of daphnids in the illuminated zone of the test apparatus (i.e. a faster positive phototaxis response). A similar dose-dependent response was observed in a test solution where the salt content of FPW was recreated in the absence of other components, suggesting that the effect was largely driven by salinity. The effect of FPW was significant when the raw FPW sample was diluted to 20% of its initial strength, while the effect of salt-matched solution was significant at a 10% dilution. A distinct effect was observed following FPW pre-exposure. After a 24 h pre-exposure to 1.5% FPW, Daphnia displayed a significantly inhibited positive phototaxis response when examined in control water, relative to control animals that were not pre-exposed to FPW. This effect was not observed in salinity pre-exposed animals, however these daphnids displayed a significantly reduced phototactic response when tested in saline waters, indicating a loss of the positive phototaxis seen in naive organisms. These data indicate that FPW can induce perturbations in the behavior of aquatic invertebrates, an effect that may influence processes such as feeding and predation rates.

AB Sediment samples were collected from a large reservoir and a river in northern Taiwan to investigate the occurrence and characteristics of Sigma 73PCNs analyzed. Results indicate that total concentrations of PCNs (Di- to Octa-CNs) measured in sediments collected in reservoir (29.2 +/- 7.11 pg/g-dw) are significantly lower than that of samples collected in river (987 +/- 440 pg/g-dw). The increasing trend of PCN concentration from upstream to downstream is found for the sediments collected in reservoir. PCN concentrations measured in surface sediments are relatively higher than that measured in sub-surface sediments collected in reservoir. Tetra-CNs consistently dominate in reservoir sediments, however, Penta-, Tetra- and Mono-CNs dominate in sediments collected at different sampling sites of the river investigated, suggesting that various sources contribute to PCNs collected from river. Indeed, diagnostic ratios indicate that mix-source contribute to PCNs measured in sediments collected from the reservoir and river in northern Taiwan.

AB Granites are widely used in construction and they may be potential sources of ionizing radiation, due to the presence of radionuclides such as K-40 and decay products from U-238 series and Th-232 series. These radionuclides occur in the minerals constituting the rocks. To evaluate the doses in humans exposed to K-40, and decay products from U-238 series and Th-232 series gamma radiation, a room with dimensions of 4.0 x 5.0 x 2.8 m(3), with uniformly distributed radiation source on the floor of granitic rocks, was computationally modeled. Adult individuals were represented in the virtual scenario by two virtual anthropomorphic phantoms FASH3 and MASH3, incorporated simultaneously in the software MCNPX 2.7.0. The mean energy deposited on each organ and tissue of FASH3 and MASH3 phantoms was determined using the MCNPX F6 tally (MeV/g/particle), while the photon flux within the room was calculated with the MCNPX F4 tally (MeV/cm(2)/particle). The organs that obtained the highest conversion coefficients CC[H-T] (Sv/Gy) were the red bone marrow (0.94), skin (0.90), breast (0.81) and bladder (0.73) for the FASH3; skin (0.89), gonads (0.88), breast (0.79) and bladder (0.70) for the MASH3. The simulated air absorbed dose rates varied between 23.4 (11%) and 25.8 (12%) nGy/h, and the annual dose rates were 0.10 (6%) and 0.11 (6%) mSv/year. These results presented acceptable statistical uncertainties and they are in agreement with the literature. Fluency of photons pointed to the central region of the room floor as the place of greatest exposure. The results showed that the organs closer to the radiation source had the highest deposited energy values. Based on the annual effective dose data obtained, it was possible to note that the values are within the literature. We believe that the methodology used will allow the investigation of any ornamental material that emits natural radiation.

AB Since Ni-rich soils are a threat to the environment, growing edible crops on Ni-rich soils can pose a serious risk to human, animal, plant and ecosystem health and, hence, is considered as a challenging task for the researchers. Contrarily, limiting the bioavailability of Ni in such soils upon the addition of suitable amendments cum foliar spray of proteinogenic amino acids having an objective to alleviate stress to crop plants can considerably reduce the environmental risk. In this pot trail, we substantiate the effects of biochar (BR) and zeolite (ZL) addition in the soil along with proline (PN) spray on the resistance, and stress responses of wheat against Ni as well as on Ni translocation and accumulation in wheat plants grown on a Ni-rich soil contaminated by electroplating effluent. The treatments, applied with and without PN spray, involved: no amendment; BR; ZL; and a concoction of both amendments (BR50%+ZL50%). We found that BR50%+ZL50% treatment significantly immobilized Ni in the soil, reduced its accumulation in the shoot, root, and grain, blocked membrane lipid peroxidation and showed an improvement in photosynthetic parameters, the status of antioxidant activities, grain biochemistry and grain yield, compared to the control. Interestingly, exogenous PN spray caused a significant additive effect on the aforementioned parameters in the wheat plants grown on BR50%+Z1.50% treated soil. Our results involved a reduced Ni bioavailability in wheat rhizosphere due to BR50%+ZL50% in soil and, furthermore, the additive effect of PN spray to scavenging ROS, obstructing peroxidation of lipid membrane and, thus providing resilience to wheat plant against Ni stress. The suggested technique can make Ni-rich soils suitable for cultivation and production of high-quality food by minimizing Ni bioavailability and toxicity to plants.

AB Microplastics can have strong sorption capacity for many contaminants, thus greatly influencing the fate, transport and bioavailability of those contaminants in the environment. However, the effect of particle size on contaminant sorption by microplastics is still poorly understood. This study investigated the sorption of phenanthrene and nitrobenzene to micron-, submicron- and nano- sized polystyrene microplastics of 170 mu m, 102 mu m, 50 mu m, 30 mu m, 800 nm, 235 nm or 50 nm. All phenanthrene sorption isotherms and most nitrobenzene sorption isotherms were linear because of the strong sorption capacity of microplastics and the hydrophobic partitioning. The log K-d values ranged between 3.07-4.20 and 1.58-3.14 log (L/kg) for phenanthrene and nitrobenzene, respectively. The log K-d values of phenanthrene and nitrobenzene both increased with decreasing particle size for micron-sized polystyrenes (micro-polystyrene) and submicron-sized polystyrenes (submicro-polystyrene). However, in comparison with 235 nm submicro-polystyrene, the log K-d values of 50 nm nano polystyrene were significantly lower for phenanthrene and comparable for nitrobenzene because its aggregation greatly reduced the effective surface area accessible for sorption. The results improved our understanding of the fate and risks of microplastics associated with the two typical organic contaminants in the micrometer to nanometer scale.

AB Chlorpyrifos is one of the most widely used organophosphate pesticides and has a record of adverse effects on applicators. Assessment of exposure to chlorpyrifos based on its urinary metabolite, 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP), is considered as the most accurate. However, urine sampling can be difficult, and the laboratory analytical procedures involved are complex and expensive. A simpler approach for assessing pesticide exposure among applicators is the whole-body dermal dosimetry method, but this needs validation. The objective of this study was to compare chlorpyrifos exposure estimates obtained separately with the urinary TCP and the whole-body dermal dosimetry methods from applicators. Exposure estimates from the whole-body dermal dosimetry method (5-29 mu g/kg/clay) showed less variation than those from the urinary TCP method (1-71 mu g/kg/day), but both were in close agreement at the mean level (16 mu g/kg/day and 15 mu g/kg/day, respectively). The whole-body dermal dosimetry method is therefore valid for providing estimates of the typical levels of pesticide exposure among applicators in situations where the urinary TCP method cannot be applied.

AB The micronucleus (MN) test in exfoliated cells of the buccal mucosa is a relatively non-invasive method for the monitoring of populations exposed to genotoxic risks. In this study, the MN test was used as bats conservation strategy. The highest frequencies of micronuclei were recorded in the frugivorous bats sampled in both urban and agricultural environments, as well as in insectivorous bats from the urban zone. Female of this group (insectivorous) presented higher frequency of MN when compared to males. Other guilds showed no difference in gender assessments in each environment, as well as in the correlation between weight and MN. In addition to micronuclei, a number of other types of nuclear abnormality were recorded, including binucleated cells and karyolysis in the frugivores from the agricultural environment. Binucleated cells were also relatively common in urban frugivores and insectivores, and karyolysis was common in insectivores. Nectarivorous bats did not exhibit a significant increase in any type of nuclear abnormality in either environment. In summary, study results indicate that buccal mucosa of bats is a sensitive site for detecting micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities. However, more research is needed to indicate whether xenobiotic agents are affecting this cellular integrity.

AB Copper and zinc accumulation in macroalgae is a complex issue. While these metals exist as micronutrients and can serve to add nutritional value to the macroalgae when consumed by both plants and animals, elevated levels of the metals can reduce growth or even kill the algae. Many water parameters can influence the toxicity of the metals, though past studies have rarely isolated individual water parameters. This study aimed to independently determine the effects that salinity and alkalinity have on the growth and accumulation of these two metals on the macroalgae Ulva fasciata, distinguishing the effects of salinity and alkalinity as whole parameters from the collective effects of the water different constituents. The effect of salinity was determined using sodium chloride additions rather than seawater dilution, as performed in past studies, while alkalinity was tested using sodium bicarbonate additions to artificial seawater. The results of the study reinforce previous findings that copper is very toxic to macroalgae, even at low concentrations (50 mu g L-1) though the effects of zinc remain inconclusive at 50 mu g L-1, since the experiment was conducted over only a two-week trial period. The research suggests that salinity and alkalinity have no significant effect on the toxicity of copper to the growth of the macroalgae, but alkalinity significantly reduced copper and increased zinc accumulation in U. fasciata. The results of this study warrant further research in the field to investigate which other components of seawater and macroalgae reduce metal toxicity in the macroalgae. Additionally, these findings suggest the need for further refinement of toxicity models when adapted to macroalgae.

AB In this study, platinum nanochains (PtNCs), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphene nano particles (GNPs) were assembled together to form a novel nanocomposite by a facile ultrasonic-assisted blending process. The PtNCs-MWCNTs-GNPs nanocomposite was characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The nanocomposite was used for the modification of glass carbon electrode (GCE) and simultaneous determination of dopamine (DA) and ascorbic acid (AA) by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and cycle voltammetry (CV). Under the optimum conditions, the calibration curves obtained are linear for the currents versus DA and AA concentrations over the range 2.00-50.0 mu M and 100-1200 mu M, respectively. And the detection limits for DA and AA are 0.500 mu M and 10.0 mu M, respectively. The detection and quantitative analysis of DA and AA in human serum and vitamin C tablets on PtNCs-MWCNTs-GNPs/GCE gave the recoveries of 104-110% and 101-108% with relative standard deviations (RSD) of 4.36-7.48% and 0.620-2.90%, respectively. The proposed PtNCs-MWCNTs-GNPs composite could provide a new platform for the routine analysis of DA and AA in terms of its good anti-interference ability, excellent reproducibility and repeatability, and feasibility of use.

AB The herbicide "fomesafen" causes phytotoxicity to the rotational wheat crop and may reduce its yield. Considering that biochar may improve remediation and biophysical conditions of the contaminated soil environments to benefit plant growth. Here, we investigated the impacts of three levels of the wheat straw-derived biochar (1%, 2%, and 4% (w/w)) on growth, physiological properties, and rhizosphere microbial communities of the wheat (Triticwn aestivum) seedlings under the fomesafen stress using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that biochar amended into soil significantly reduced the uptake of wheat to fomesafen and thereby eliminate its toxicity to wheat seedlings. Moreover, biochar increased the abundance and diversity of plant beneficial bacterial and fungal taxa in the rhizosphere of wheat seedlings. Compared with the three addition amounts, amendment with 2% of biochar has the best effects to reduce the toxicity of fomesafen on wheat seedlings and maintain the balance of soil microbial community structure in soil contaminated with fomesafen (1.0 mg kg(-1)). Overall, our results suggest that the level of biochar application influences the structure and diversity of soil microbiome (and mycobiome) and plant performance under abiotic stress conditions.

AB Fish embryos are increasingly being utilized in aquatic toxicity testing, as evidenced by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's approval of the fish embryo acute toxicity (FET) test. However, the FET test only allows for the estimation of acute toxicity, whereas other test methods such as the larval growth and survival (LGS) test allow for the estimation of both acute and chronic toxicity. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the FET test is less sensitive than other test methods for some neurotoxic compounds. To address these limitations, efforts to identify sublethal endpoints that increase FET test sensitivity and allow for the prediction of sublethal adverse effects have begun. As such, the objectives of the current study were 1) to compare estimated LC50 values from the FET and LGS test for three known neurotoxicants: fluoride (F), nickel (Ni), and cadmium (Cd) and 2) to evaluate the responsiveness of potential sublethal endpoints for the FET test related to growth (i.e., wet weight and snout-vent length), neurological development (i.e., spontaneous contraction frequency and eye size), and cardiovascular function (i.e., heart rate and pericardial area). The calculated LC50 values from the F and Cd FET test were significantly higher than those from the LGS test, demonstrating that the FET test is less sensitive than the LGS test for neurotoxic compounds. Only Cd exposure resulted in alterations in any of the sublethal endpoints investigated. Embryos/eleutheroembryos exposed to Cd displayed alterations in length, eye size, and pericardial area at concentrations five-fold less than the estimated LC50 value, suggesting that for Cd the inclusion of these sublethal endpoints would improve the sensitivity of the FET test. Overall, these results provide evidence that for some neurotoxicants, the inclusion of sublehtal endpoints may improve the utility of the FET test; however, further research utilizing a broader range of neurotoxicants with differing mechanisms of action, is needed to fully establish such endpoints in the context of routine FET test.

AB Groundwater contaminated by Cr(VI) requires effective remediation to prevent adverse environmental impacts. The biodegradation of Cr(VI) has been documented for several decades, but little remains known about the removal fate of chromium, including the main species of reductase (sites) and functional genes involved in Cr (VI) reduction in mixed bacterial consortium. Cr(VI) reduction in this study was verified to be an enzyme-mediated process. Meanwhile, Cr(VI) reduction of different cell components demonstrated that the extracellular enzyme was the main active substance, and the distribution of Cr after experiment was quantified using mass balance calculation. Furthermore, the optimal pH for reduction was 8.0, with the reduction rate decreasing with increasing initial Cr(VI) concentrations. The co-existing oxyanions had little effect on Cr(VI) reduction, while the presence of other heavy metals had a relatively significant influence. The evolutionary behavior of microbial community structure and functional genes affected by Cr(VI) were also analyzed, which provided new insights on the underlying mechanisms involved in bioreduction in this study. These results generated new understanding of the reduction mechanisms on the Cr-relevant bacterial species and genes, which would be helpful in designing strategies for the bioremediation of Cr(VI) contaminated water.

AB Toxic trace element (TTE) contamination in urban soils may pose potential health risks, especially in cities with previous industrial activities. This study aimed to investigate soil contamination in urban allotments in Sheffield, the uptake of TTEs in autumn and spring sown onions (Allium cepa), and their potential risks on human health via consumption of the crops. Paired soil and plant samples were taken in triplicates from four private allotments to assess potentially elevated levels of lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), arsenic (As), and chromium (Cr). These elements in soils exceeded the ambient background levels for England. Both Pb and As exceeded some UK and EU soil tolerable limits. Concentration factors (CF) were calculated as the ratio of trace element in the plant as compared to that in the soil, and uptake rates were in the order Zn > Cu > Cr > Pb > As. Concentrations were higher for most TTEs in spring sown onions (SSO), and had significantly higher CF (p < 0.05) for Pb and Cr than autumn sown onions (ASO), whereas the opposite was true for As. Toxic elements in plants did not exceed FAO/WHO intake limits when considering TTE content per plant and consumption rates. Human health risk assessment calculations using target hazard quotients (THQ) and hazard indexes (HI) indicated that consuming onions alone did not pose an immediate health risk.

AB A fine particulate matter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) in the underground subway system are the cause of many diseases. The iron containing PMs frequently confront in underground stations, which ultimately have an impact on the health of living beings especially in children. Hence, it is necessary to conduct toxicity assessment of chemical species and regularized the indoor air pollutants to ensure the good health of children. Therefore, in this study, a new indoor air quality (IAQ) index is proposed based on toxicity assessment by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model. The new indices called comprehensive indoor air toxicity (CIAT) and cumulative comprehensive indoor air toxicity (CCIAT) suggests the new standards based on toxicity assessment of PM2.5. QSAR based deep neural network (DNN) exhibited the best model in predicting the toxicity assessment of chemical species in particulate matters, which yield lowest RMSE and Q(F3)(2) values of 0.6821 and 0.8346, respectively, in the test phase. After integration with a standard concentration of PM2.5, two health risk indices of CIAT and CCIAT are introduced based on toxicity assessment results, which can be use as the toxicity standard of PM2.5 for detail IAQ management in a subway station. These new health risk indices suggest more sensitive air pollutant level of iron containing fine particulate matters or molecular level contaminants in underground spaces, alerting the health risk of adults and children in "unhealthy for sensitive group".

AB The health effects of metals and benzene exposure have been extensively investigated; however, information on the impact of chronic environmental metal and benzene exposure on human urinary metabolome is limited. In this study, a total of 566 participants, including 352 elderly and 214 children, were split into the "exposed" and "control" groups. The urine samples of all the participants were collected and stored at - 80 degrees C until analysis. The urinary levels of 17 metals and S-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) were determined by the ICP-MS and LC MS/MS methods to comprehensively assess the personal metal and benzene exposure levels, respectively. Then, the individual levels of metal and benzene exposure were correlated to the metabolic consequences of ambient pollutant exposure, which were previously observed in our metabolomics study. As a result, multiple metals, including Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn, exhibited a significant linear dose-dependent association with one or more urinary metabolites, including two amino acids (pyroglutamic acid and 3-methylhistidine), three organic acids (azelaic acid, decenedioic acid, and hydroxytetradecanedioic acid), ten medium-chainacylcarnitines (heptenedioylcamitine, octenedioylcarnitine, nonenedioylcamitine, decenedioylglucuronide, 3-hydroxydecanoylcamitine, dodecanedioylcamitine, nonanoylcarnitine, decadienylcamitine, hydroxydodecenoylcarnitine, dodecadienylcamitine, and dodecenoylcarnitine), and one glucuronide conjugate (decenedioylglucuronide). These observations indicate that the increased environmental metal exposure has caused various oxidative stress-related effects, including the depletion of antioxidants, accelerated muscle proteolysis, elevated activity of UCTs, increased lipid peroxidation, and the disorder of mitochondria] lipid metabolism among exposed children and the elderly. The current study provides new insights into the biological effects induced by metal exposure in the environment.

AB Herein, crop (vegetables and rice, n = 30), soil (n = 14), dust (n = 12), and PM10 (n = 25) samples were collected to assess the environmental quality of a former e-waste recycling area and evaluate the related health risks. In dust and PM10, the concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) were lower than previously reported values, although the numbers for soil, vegetables, and rice remained high. The average accumulation factors of heavy metals in crops decreased in the order of Zn > Cd > Ni > Cu > Pb, and soil was identified as the largest contributor to crop pollution. Heavy metal ingestion largely occurred via rice consumption, which accounted for a significant fraction of the total average daily dose (ADD; 75.2-86.7% in children and 78.0-91.7% in adults), especially for Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn. However, in the case of Pb, soil ingestion accounted for 48.9% of the ADD in adults, while in children, vegetable, rice, and dust ingestion accounted for 44.7%, 28.6%, and 23.7% of the ADD, respectively. The combined exposure hazard indices at the fifth, median, and 95th percentiles for all heavy metals were determined as 2.54, 9.40, and 40.1 for adults and as 3.75, 13.7, and 58.4 for children, respectively. In terms of health risk, crop consumption was identified as the major exposure pathway for both children and adults, featuring a contribution of 99.9%. In addition, the 95th percentile carcinogenic risks for Pb exceeded the acceptable level. Thus, this work shows that to reduce the health risk for local residents in the former e-waste area, more attention should be paid to soil repair.

AB To investigate contamination level, origins and spatial distribution characteristics of heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, Hg, Ni, Cd, As, and Cr) in agricultural soils of Gaogang Town, a typical industrial transfer-undertaking region of the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China, a total of 162 surface soil samples were collected in August 2016 and determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and atomic fluorescence spectrometry. Moreover, heavy metals contents were systematically analyzed by pollution index, enrichment factor, multivariate statistical approaches and geostatistical analysis. The results showed that the mean concentrations of Cd, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cu and Hg were higher than the soil background values of Guangdong Province, and the relatively high values of pollution index and enrichment factor indicated that these elements (Cd, Pb, Zn and Hg) had cumulative trends in soil. All results of multivariate statistical approaches and geostatistical analysis showed that pollution were heavily distributed in areas of industries, river and dense road network. The eight heavy metals in agricultural soils of Gaogang Town came from three different sources. Arsenic, Cr, Cu and Ni arose mainly from parent materials. Agricultural practices and traffic activities were the main sources of Cd, Pb and Zn. Mercury mainly came from industrial practices.

AB Secondary plant metabolites play an important role in providing protection to plants against herbivore insect pests. Keeping in view the increasing importance of biopesticides, the crude extracts from different plants are being investigated for insecticidal activities. Alpinia galanga, a medicinal plant belonging to family Zingiberaceae exhibits a wide range of biological activities. In the present study, crude extracts of A. galanga and its purified compounds i.e. 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate and galangin were evaluated for their effect on various nutritional parameters of Spodoptera litura (Fab.). All the extracts exhibited a significant influence on relative growth and consumption rates as well as efficiency of conversion of ingested and digested food. Ethyl acetate extract was found to be the most effective causing significant reduction in values of RGR, RCR, ECI and ECD of S. litura larvae in comparison to control larvae. The highest concentration of the ethyl acetate extract (2500 ppm) resulted in 44.95%, 10.99%, 38.08% and 37.04% decrease respectively in RGR, RCR, ECI and ECD in comparison to control. The purified compounds also showed inhibitory effects on various nutritional parameters. 1'-Acetoxychavicol acetate was found to be more effective in comparison to galangin.

AB This paper presented a groundwater quality monitoring in Seini town, North-West of Romania, by assessing 18 physicochemical parameters (pH, EC, COD, turbidity, ht, NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, Cl-, Al, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn, Cd, Cr, Ni and As) from 12 private dug wells and 5 private drilled wells, each with unique characteristics and used as a drinking water source. The pollution, quality status and risk assessment of drinking water sources were assessed, by pollution, quality and risk indices. Statistical methodology and cluster analysis were applied in order to elaborate and improve upon a mathematical model. 2 D and 3 D mathematical models were elaborated to show the functions that better describe the dependence between a set of physicochemical parameters. Heavy metal pollution index (HPI) and heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) results indicated that the studied drinking water sources presented no heavy metal contamination. Human health risk assessment indices showed that the consumption of studied waters presented no non-carcinogenic risk at heavy metals, but potential non-carcinogenic risk at NO3-. The water quality index (WQI) classifies the majority of samples as waters with excellent quality and the minority of samples in waters with poor and very poor quality. By geostatistical techniques, the spatial patterns of the main physicochemical indicators were established for both the surface of the aquifer and its depth. The aim of the water quality study was to establish the toxicity degree of water, its influence on human health and to inform the population regarding the use of individual water sources.

AB The effects and regulatory mechanisms of co-inoculation of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) and rhizobium in plant-soil systems remain unclear, despite numerous reports that PGPRs or rhizobium can alleviate metal toxicity. We used the co-inoculation of the PGPR Paenibacillus mucilaginosus and the metal-resistant rhizobium Sinorhizobium meliloti for exploring the physiological and biochemical responses of the plant-soil system in metal-contaminated soil. The co-inoculation with the PGPR and rhizobium significantly increased the nutrient (N, P, and K) contents in plant tissues and promoted plant growth in soil contaminated with copper (Cu). Stress from Cu-induced reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation were largely attenuated by the co-inoculation by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes. The contents and uptake of Cu in plant tissues increased significantly in the co-inoculation treatment compared with the uninoculated control and individual inoculation treatment. Co-inoculation with PGPR and rhizobium significantly increased soil microbial biomass, enzymatic activities, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and soil organic matter contents compared with the uninoculated control. Interestingly, co-inoculation also affected the composition of the rhizospheric microbial community, and slightly increased rhizospheric microbial diversity. These improvements of the soil fertility and biological activity also had a beneficial impact on plant growth under Cu stress. Our results suggested that alfalfa co-inoculated with PGPR and rhizobium could increase plant growth and Cu uptake in metal-contaminated soil by alleviating plant Cu stress and improving soil biochemical properties. These results indicate that the co-application of PGPR and rhizobium can have a positive effect on the biochemical responses of alfalfa-soil systems in soil contaminated by heavy metals and can provide an efficient strategy for the phytomanagement of metal-contaminated land.

AB Long-term exposure to particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) from automobile exhaust impairs spermatogenesis through oxidative stress injury, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. To investigate the toxic mechanism of PM2.5-induced spermatogenesis impairment, we focused on the MAPK signaling pathway. We also examined the effects of treatment with vitamins C and E on spermatogenic function. Male SD rats were divided randomly into three groups: control (0.9% sterilized saline), PM2.5 exposure (20 mg/kg.b.w.), and PM2.5 exposure (20 mg/kg.b.w.) with vitamin intervention (vitamin C, 100 mg/kg.b.w.; vitamin E, 50 mg/kg.b.w.). Male rats showed a marked decline in fertility and decreased sperm quality after PM2.5 exposure. The expression of SOD and Nrf2 was significantly decreased, and that of MDA was increased markedly. The expression of blood-testis barrier-associated proteins, such as ZO-1, occludin, connexin 43, and beta-catenin, was significantly decreased, the Bc1-2/Bax ratio was downregulated, and the cleaved caspase-3 level was increased. Phosphorylation of MAPKs, including ERKs, JNICs, and p38, was upregulated. Treatment with vitamins C and E reversed the damage induced by PM2.5 exposure. These results suggest that PM2.5 from automobile exhaust disrupted spermatogenesis via ROS-mediated MAPK pathways, and that a combined vitamin C and E intervention effectively mitigated toxicity in the male reproductive system.

AB This research was conducted as factorial on the basis of randomized complete block design with three replications to evaluate the effects of salicylic acid (1 mM SA), jasmonic acid (0.5 mM JA) and SA + JA on H+-ATPase hydrolytic activity of tonoplast in soybean roots under 0, 4, 7 and 10 dS m(-1) NaCl levels. The H+-ATPase hydrolytic activity of tonoplast was increased under 4 dS m(-1), but with rising salinity up to 7 and 10 dS m(-1), the activity of H+-ATPase and ATP content were decreased in root cells. Root growth, potassium, calcium, magnesium and iron contents in plant tissues were decreased, while sodium, manganese, zinc and copper contents were increased by salinity, leading to a reduction in chlorophyll content index (CCI), relative water content (RWC), plant biomass and grain yield of soybean. Treatment of plants with SA, JA and SA + JA improved H+-ATPase activity and ATP content in root cells. JA treatment also reduced root growth, thereby limited sodium uptake by roots and translocation to the shoots. Foliar spray of JA only increased magnesium and iron contents in plant tissues, with no significant effect on other cations. In contrast, SA and SA + JA improved root growth and enhanced most of the cations, CCI, RWC, plant biomass and consequently grain yield under different levels of salinity. The SA + JA was a superior treatment in diminishing the harmful effects of salinity on soybean plant performance, compared with individual application of these growth regulators.

AB Lomefloxacin, an antibacterial agent with known photo-induced toxicity in clinical studies, is frequently detected in aquatic environments. Investigating the photo-induced toxicity of lomefloxacin in aquatic organisms is therefore of importance for assessing its ecological risks. In this study, the effects of lomefloxacin on survival, growth and reproduction of Daphnia magna under simulated sunlight radiation (SSR) were investigated, and the mechanism of action was revealed. Results indicated that SSR containing UV radiation increased the acute toxicity of lomefloxacin to Daphnia magna relative to white fluorescent light irradiation. Under SSR, 100 mu M lomefloxacin significantly enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation, and decreased activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase. The biochemical observations and apparent effects on the organism indicate that oxidative stress plays a central role in the acute photo-induced toxicity. Chronic toxicity results showed that SSR significantly affected growth and reproduction of Daphnia magna, whereas lomefloxacin reduced the damage of UV radiation in SSR through light shielding. This study provides insight into the mechanism of photo-induced toxicity and can support the risk assessment of chemicals in the aquatic environment by including the impacts of sunlight irradiation on toxicity.

AB Nanomaterials, such as ZrO2 nanoparticles (ZrO2 NPs), are very effective in water remediation. However, the safety issues related to nanoparticle release and toxicity to humans remain to be resolved. Here we evaluated the cytotoxicity of ZrO2 NPs and their adducts with pollutants using a human cell panel containing stomach, intestine, liver and kidney cells. We found that different pollutants or ZrO2NP/pollutant adducts targeted cells from different organs, suggesting the necessity of a cell panel to model oral exposures. The cooperation of ZrO2 NPs and pollutants was quite complex, consisting of synergistic, antagonistic, or additive effects. For example, ZrO2 NPs enhanced the cytotoxicity of Pb2+ in GES(-1) cells and of Pb2+, Cd2+ in FHC cells, while alleviating the toxicity of Pb2+ and As (III) in HepG2 and Hek293 cells. Our results also indicated that even concentrations of pollutants that meet the national standard, the ZrO2 NPs concentration should be kept below 17 g/mL to avoid ZrO2 NP/pollutant adduct synergistic toxicity.

AB Silicon (Si) and selenium (Se) are beneficial for many higher plants when grown on stress conditions. However, the mechanisms underlying the differential effects between foliar Si and Se in alleviation of plant toxicity exposed to cadmium (Cd) stress are remained unclear. In this study, we investigated the discrepant mechanisms of foliar Si and Se on Cd absorption and compartmentation by roots, its translocation in xylem, and the antioxidant system within Chinese flowering cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp. chinensis var. utilis) under low and high Cd stress. Results showed that plant growth was significantly enhanced by foliar additions of Si or/and Se according to an increased plant tissue biomass at high Cd exposure. In addition, the foliar coupled addition of Si and Se showed little effects on the concentrations of Si or Se in plant tissues in comparison with the single addition of foliar Si or Se respectively. The foliar Si alone or combined with Se markedly reduced the Cd concentrations in plant shoots under two Cd treatments. This might be explained by the lower Cd concentrations in symplast and apoplast and the higher Cd concentrations in cell walls of plant roots, and the lower Cd concentrations in xylem sap. However, no great changes in these values were observed under the treatments of foliar Se alone. Moreover, the foliar additions of Si or/and Se all increased the antioxidant enzyme activities of SOD, CAT and APX in plant tissues, especially at high Cd dosage. No significant differences in the increasing degrees of these three antioxidant enzymes were found between the foliar Si and Se treatments. However, only the foliar Se alone or combined with Si markedly promoted the antioxidant enzyme activities of GR and DHAR in plant tissues. Our findings demonstrate that the alleviation of Cd toxicity by foliar Si maybe mainly responsible for inhibition of Cd absorption and its translocation to plant shoots, reinforcing its compartmentation into root cell walls, whilst enhancing the antioxidant enzyme system may be employed by foliar Se.

AB Bacterioplankton communities play a critical role in ecological processes in river systems, and shifts of their composition may impact microbial levels and raise public health concerns. The aim of this study was to comprehensively analyze the essential factors influencing bacterioplankton community, along with pathogen, and to estimate the health risk caused by the pathogens downstream of the Liushahe River, which is located in the famous touristic city Xishuangbanna. Results showed that wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and a subtropical recreational park impacted the bacterioplankton community and pathogen population, and potential pathogen identification demonstrated that 76 of 145 reference genera were present in the river. Moreover, the bacterioplankton community and pathogen were differently impacted by environmental gradients, and SRP, NO2 and pH were main factors influencing bacterioplankton community while pathogen population was highly correlated with temperature and turbidity. In addition, it is noted that the pathogen population was dominated by bacterioplankton community and this might because the capacity of resistance invasion pathogen was determined by of bacterioplankton community diversity. Therefore, bacterioplankton community diversity can be used to control and predict the amount of pathogens. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) also revealed that the infection risks of Escherichia coli (E. coli), Mycobacterium avium (M. avium), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) during five recreational activities, especially water-based activities in the touristic city, were greater than that in natural areas and mostly exceeded the U.S. EPA risk limit for recreational activities. Our study offered the first insight into the potential relationship between the bacterioplankton community and bacterial pathogens within a touristic river.

AB Soil acts as a repository for many metals that human activity releases into the environment. Cadmium enters agricultural soils primarily from application of phosphate fertilizers and sewage sludge. Among soil bacteria, rhizobia have a great agronomic and environmental significance and are major contributors to a sustainable maintenance of soil fertility. However, the services that this group of microorganisms provides are affected by environmental constraints, such as Cd contamination. Bioactive compounds also influence soil microorganisms. Famesol is a phytocompound with recognized bioactivity, inducing both beneficial and harmful effects. In this study, Rhizobium sp. strain E20-8 was exposed to sole or combined exposure to Cd and farnesol. Results showed that famesol (25 and 200 mu M) did not affect rhizobia; exposure to Cd (mu M) inhibited rhizobia growth and induced several biomarkers of oxidative stress; exposure to the combination of farnesol and Cd reduced oxidative damage, and the highest concentration of farnesol tested reduced Cd accumulation and allowed a significant growth recovery. Famesol protective effects on rhizobia exposed to Cd is novel information which can be used in the development of microbe -based environmental engineering strategies for restoration of metal contaminated areas.

AB Throughout evolutionary history bees have developed complex communication systems. For social bees, communication is important for both the individual and the development of the colony. Successful communication helps bees to recognize relatives, defend the colony, and promote recruitment to optimize foraging of floral-resources. Bees' contribution to pollination is of broad environmental and economic importance. However, studies have reported that anthropogenic actions, such as the use of pesticides, negatively affect bee survival and behavior. We tested the effect of a commercially available pesticide mix containing two pesticide classes, a neonicotinoid and a pyrethroid, on the social behavior of the stingless bee, Melipona quadrifasciata (Lepeletier, 1863). After determining a sublethal dose of the pesticides, we tested the effect of an acute dose on antennation and trophallaxis behaviors of worker bees. Our results showed a drastic reduction in the communication and social interactions of bees.

AB Fate of metallic elements and their migration mechanisms in a waste mud impoundment and affected downstream were assessed. Physicochemical and mineralogical methods combined with PHREEQC calculation, statistical analysis and review of relevant literatures were employed. Results showed that the waste in mud impoundment had been severely weathered and acidized. Metallic elements exhibited high mobility and activity, with a mobility ranking order of Cd > Zn > Mn > Cu approximate to Cr > As approximate to Pb. Hydraulic transportation originating from elevation variation was the most important driving force for metallic elements migration. Although damming standstill was considered as an effective strategy for controlling coarse suspended particulate pollutants, metallic elements were still transported to the Hengshi River in both dissolved phase and fine suspended particle phase accompanied by the overflow of acid mine drainage. The concentrations of dissolved metallic elements were attenuated significantly along the Hengshi River within 41 km stretch. Precipitation/co-precipitation of iron oxyhydroxides, especially schwertmannite, ferrihydrite and goethite minerals, were established as the most critical processes for metallic elements attenuation in river water. Accompanied by metals migration in the river, two pollution sensitive sites with notably high content of metals in the stretch of S6-S8 and S10, were identified in gently sloping river stretch.

AB Chlorothalonil is a broad-spectrum fungicide and diflubenzuron is an insect growth regulator used to control many insect larvae feeding on agricultural, forest and ornamental plants. Honey bee larvae may be exposed to both via contaminated pollen, in the form of beebread, added to their diet by their adult nurse sisters. In this study, we determined how single (acute: 72 h mortality) and repeated (chronic: mortality until emergence as adults) exposure to chlorothalonil and diflubenzuron in their diet affected honey bee larvae reared in vitro. The tested doses of chlorothalonil (20, 100, or 200 mg/L) did not impact 72 h larval mortality acutely relative to that of the solvent control. The 72 h mortality of larvae exposed to 1.6 mg/L and higher doses of diflubenzuron acutely in their diet (47.2-63.9% mortality) was significantly higher than that of larvae fed the solvent control, with no predictable dose dependent pattern observed. In the chronic toxicity tests, consuming an artificial diet with 30 or 100 mg/L chlorothalonil and 0.8, 1.3 or 2 mg/L diflubenzuron significantly lowered the survival of honey bee larvae over that of larvae feeding on the solvent control diet. We calculated risk quotients (RQs) for both compounds using the data we generated in our experiments. Collectively, the RQs suggest that neither compound is likely to affect larval mortality directly at field relevant doses given that pollen composes only a fraction of the total larval diet. Nevertheless, our data do not preclude any sublethal effects that chronic exposure to either compound may cause.

AB Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.), a highly nutritious grain crop, is resistant to abiotic stresses (drought, salinity, and cold) and offers an alternate crop to endure harsh environmental conditions under the face of climate change. Naturally, quinoa genome displays a wide degree of variabilities in drought tolerance strategies. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate drought tolerance variations and stress tolerance enhancement in four quinoa genotypes (Pichaman, Colorado-407D, IESP and 2-Want) thorough foliage-applied H2O2 with the purpose of identifying suitable genotype for water limited environments. The plants were exposed to two watering regimes (75% and 30% pot WHC) and foliage-applied H2O2 treatments (15 mM). The drought stress significantly reduced plant growth, relative water contents, chlorophyll and carotenoids contents and increased ROS production (H2O2 and O-2(center dot-)) resulting in higher oxidative damage in all quinoa genotypes. Besides, drought stress significantly enhanced the antioxidants (SOD, PPO, and PAL) activity, total soluble sugars, proline, AsA contents and increased the total accumulation of measured inorganic ions in all quinoa genotypes. The PCA analysis indicated that parameters related to osmotic adjustment and antioxidant capacity were more pronounced in 2-Want and IESP genotypes, while parameters depicting oxidative damage were higher in Colorado-407D and more specifically in Pichaman. However, foliage-applied H2O2 effectively improved the osmolytes accumulation, antioxidants activity and K+/Na* ratio which increased water relations, reduced lipid peroxidation and ultimately resulted in higher plant growth. Overall, 2-Want and IESP genotypes were found relatively more drought resistant, while exogenous application of H2O2 can be opted for more improvement in osmotic adjustment and antioxidant system, which may further enhance drought tolerance, even in sensitive genotypes of quinoa, such as Pichaman.

AB The species trait-environment relationships in understory vegetation were carried out on metalliferous sites created by historical Zn Pb mining (S Poland), on which natural revegetation took place. The study sites were 31 small heaps of waste rock covered by an 80-120 year old beech forest. The sites were described in terms of plant coverage, species richness and composition, and the composition of plant traits. Three types of understory communities that were identified were compared for environmental variables and plant parameters. Despite a high concentration of heavy metals in soils, namely Cd, Pb, and Zn, the degree of shading by the tree canopy was the main factor determining variation in understory communities. The understories that developed in low and strong shading were similar to some extent: They had high number of species, and they were characterized by a high proportion of the ancient forest species. The species composition changed substantially with increasing coverage of trees; mixed strategy plants withdrew, while the stress tolerant species became more abundant. The other predictor of community structure was the ratio of Cd to Ca, which was responsible for the decrease of woody plants and the endangered species. This study proved that, in the case of highly complex and productive ecosystems, even with a high degree of contamination with heavy metals, the biotic factors play a primary role.

AB As a new tetronic acid derivative insecticide, spirotetramat has been reported to be toxic to an array of aquatic organisms. However, the toxic effects of spirotetramat on zebrafish especially at ovary are still obscure. Hereby, the acute toxicity of spirotetramat towards zebrafish ( Danio rerio), as well as the changes on biochemical and histological traits of ovary were investigated. The acute toxicity test results showed that the median lethal concentration (LC50) value of spirotetramat were 9.61 mg/L and 7.21 mg/L at 72 h and 96 h, respectively, suggesting spirotetramat has moderate toxicity to zebrafish. In the following sub-lethal toxicity test, the gene expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and gonadotropic hormone receptor (FSHR and LHR) together with the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in ovary were measured at 14, 21, and 28 days after exposure to 36, 360 and 720 mu g/L. Under high concentration treatment (360 and 720 mu g/L), MDA content, the relative transcription CAT and SOD gene level increased significantly in ovary (p < 0.05). That indicated sublethal doses spirotetramat caused oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in zebrafish ovary during the entire experimental period. Under the exposure to spirotetramat at 720 mu g/L after 14 days, the relative transcript FSHR gene level was down regulated, and the relative transcript LHR gene level was up regulated. Moreover, spirotetramat affected the oocyte development especially on the diameter size and maturation during the ovary tissue biopsies at 28 days. Taken together, these findings revealed the adverse effects of spirotetramat on fish from the biochemical and histological aspects.

AB Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are extremely incessant anthropogenic contaminants found in the environment, with dreadful risk to aquatic ecosystems. However, there is a limited amount of data concerning their impacts on freshwater organisms. 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'-decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) and 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) are significant components of total PBDEs in water. The sublethal effects of BDE-47, BDE-209 and their binary mixtures on the aquatic organism Daphnia magna were investigated in acute and chronic exposure experiments. Immobilization and heartbeat were studied in daphnids after 48 h of exposure. Mortality rate, breed number, Cholinesterase (ChE), Glutathione S-transferases (GST) and Catalase (CAT) activities were evaluated after 21 days of exposure. The results showed that at 100 and 200 mu g/L concentration of BDE-47, immobilization rate of daphnids were inhibited by 44.0 +/- 16.7% and 88.0 +/- 10.9%, respectively. The binary mixture of BDE-47 and BDE-209 had uncongenial effects on immobilization of D. magna under acute toxicity test. BDE-209 significantly increased the heartbeat rate of daphnids, which increased even further when combined with BDE-47. After 21 days of exposure, daphnids exposed to single BDE-47 were physiologically altered. The combination of BDE-47 with BDE-209 significantly decreased the mortality rate of daphnids. Irrespective of the concentration, higher numbers of offsprings were produced in the mixtures compared to BDE-47 treatment alone. ChE activities significantly (p < 0.05) decreased at concentrations of 2 and 4 pg/L in single BDE-47 treatment, while GST activity significantly (p < 0.05) decreased at 0.5 g/L. CAT activities significantly increased with BDE-47 treatments in all the tested concentrations (p < 0.05). The mixtures significantly affect ChE (p < 0.05), GST (p < 0.05) and CAT activities (p < 0.05). The results illustrated that the toxicity of the mixture of PBDE congeners exposed to aquatic organisms may have antagonistic effects. The 21 days chronic test in this study suggests that acute toxicity tests, i.e. 48-h tests, using Daphnia may lead to underestimation of risks associated with PBDEs, especially, BDE-209. Hence, there is a necessity to re-examine PBDE congeners' environmental risk in aquatic organisms.

AB Pseudo-persistent organic pollutants, such as anionic surfactants (AS), are nowadays among the more complex problems that threaten the aquatic environments and other environmental compartments. The present work describes the identification and efficiency of a consortium, isolated from Algerian industrial wastewater, to remove three anionic surfactants (i.e., sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES)). The genetic analysis of 16S rRNA indicated that these strains are Alcaligenes faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Under aerobic conditions, pH 7.0 and optimum temperature of 30 degrees C, the mixed consortium allowed to degrade 85.1% of initial SDBS amount after 144 h of incubation with half-life of 20.8 h. While E. cloacae and S. marcescens pure strains eliminated 46% and 41% less SDBS respectively. Evenly, SDS was degraded at only 23.71% by A. faecalis strain. However, the degradation capacity of SDS by the consortium was very high (94.2%) with a half-life of 9.8 h. The SLES anionic surfactant showed a lower biodegradation by the consortium (47.53%) due to the presence of ether oxide units in the chemical structure of SLES which induced toxicity to the medium. The investigation of the biodegradation of this type of organic pollutants by microorganisms has recently become a key issue for the environmental protection area.

AB Phytochelatin synthase isolated from microorganisms, yeasts, algae and plant, serve a fundamental role in reducing heavy metals. In this research the in silico PCS gene structure (SoPCS) of sugarcane, its secondary and 3D protein structure, physicochemical properties, cell localization and phylogenetic tree were predicted utilizing bioinformatics tools. SoPCS expression in the leaves and roots of sugarcane in tissue culture treated with cadmium was also studied utilizing real time PCR. The predicted SoPCS gene contains 1524 nucleotides, a protein encoded with 508 amino acids of which the molecular weight is 55953.3 Da, 6 exons and 5 introns. The subcellular position of the enzyme is mitochondrion or cytoplasmic. Two domains belonging to the phytochelatin synthase family with similar features was found in Pfam having more than 97% similarity with the predicted SoPCS protein. Phylogeny analyses of plant species were well isolated from other organisms. Ten disulfide-bonded cysteines were excluded from the structure of SoPCS. The predicted 3D structure of SoPCS showed that it is able to bind to L-gamma-glutamylcysteine as substrate. The binding site sequence of PCS included amino acids 52(Q),55(P),56(A),57(F), 58(C),103(G),104(I),151(S),163(G),165(F),206(D), 213(R). The common amino acid with conserved sequence in the binding site of the plant was 103Gly. Gene expression indicated that SoPCS has an important role in the response of sugarcane to cadmium with potential use in genetic engineering to remove metal contaminants in the environment. This is the first characterization of a PCS from sugarcane.

AB In order to evaluate the effects of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) on the ocular surface, different concentrations (100 and 1000 mu g/ml) of DEP eye drops were administered on the mouse ocular surface for a period of 28 days. After DEP treatment, the corneal epithelial permeability to Oregon Green Dextran was studied, which increased proportionally with time. Also, the number of corneal epithelial cell layers significantly increased, which was accompanied with a high Ki67 expression. On the other hand, the number of goblet cells in the conjunctival fornix were reduced, and apoptotic cells were detected in the corneal and conjunctival epithelium by TUNEL assay in the DEP treated group, along with increased Caspase 3/8 expression. Furthermore, the number of CD4 positive cells significantly increased in the conjunctiva, while NF-kappa B p65 (phospho S536) expression was elevated in the cornea and also the conjunctiva. Our data revealed that the topical administration of DEP on the ocular surface in mouse disrupted the organized structure of the ocular surface and induced an inflammation of the cornea and conjunctiva.

AB Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most toxic metals released into the environment. Here, we investigated the protective role of Zn2+ and/or N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) against Cd cytotoxicity in the erythrocytes of Arbor Acres (AA) broiler chickens. Four hundred one-day-old AA chickens were divided into 12 groups for in vitro and in vivo studies. Zn2+ and/or NAC was given to the Cd exposed AA chickens to assess their protective roles. This was accomplished by investigating nuclear morphological abnormalities, oxidative stress (SOD, CAT, GPx, GSH and T-AOC), cell apoptosis, ROS accumulation and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Results showed that Cd led to dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity in the erythrocytes of AA chickens characterized by morphological abnormalities, nucleus damage, increased apoptosis rate and antioxidants depletion. Zn2+ or NAC significantly decreased the erythrocyte apoptosis, ROS production and mitochondrial membrane depolarization caused by Cd. SOD, CAT, GPx, GSH and T-AOC activities significantly decreased both in serum and erythrocytes of Cd exposed AA chickens. The supplementation with Zn2+ or NAC alleviated Cd induced oxidative stress through promoting SOD or GPx/GSH activities respectively. NAC presented a better role in reducing apoptosis, improving antioxidant activities more than Zn2+ in vitro. The combined use of Zn2+ and NAC enhanced cytoprotection in Cd exposed erythrocytes of AA chickens compared to Zn2+ or NAC alone. In conclusion, Zn2+ and NAC exerted remarkable protective roles in Cd exposed erythrocytes of AA chickens by inhibiting cell apoptosis and oxidative stress, and this provides a promising approach to antagonize Cd poisoning in poultry.

AB The rapid development and application of nanotechnology have led to increasing concern about the environmental implications of released nanomaterials and potential risks to public health and aquatic ecosystems. Information on the joint effect of nanomaterials and co-existing contaminants such as heavy metals is still inadequate. Our work investigated the effect of Al2O3 nanoparticles (NPs; nano-Al2O3) on the toxic effect of Pb in the unicellular marine phytoplankton Isochrysis galbana. Results showed that a dose-response effect of nano-Al(2)O(3)was found. Significant enhancement of fluorescence in cell cytoplasm rather than cell membrane occurred in the presence of nano-Al2O3, indicating that nano-Al2O3 can penetrate cells and affect the fluorescence emitted from the chloropigments inside them. The presence of nano-Al(2)O(3 )has no impact on the toxic effect of Pb at an NP concentration of 1 mg/L but increased that at NP concentrations of 10 mg/L and 100 mg/L. A synergistic effect was also found for the toxic effect of Pb in the presence of 10 mg/L nano-Al2O3. The presence of 100 mg/L nano-Al(2)O(3 )significantly increased the bio-uptake of Pb in the range of 0.25 mg/L to 2.0 mg/L Pb, and the maximum accumulated Pb in algae can reach up to 18.22 ng/10(5) cells with 100 mg/L nano-Al2O3 compared with Pb alone at 2.0 mg/L(12.53 ng/10(5) cells). Inside cells, Pb loaded onto nano-Al2O3 can be more toxic than the same amount of free Pb species. The results of toxicity tests and accumulated Pb in algae imply that, in addition to the total Pb cell content, the bioavailability of Pb inside algae should be taken into consideration in evaluating the joint toxicity effect. Our work enhances understanding of the combined toxicity of NPs and co-existing heavy metals and is of practical significance in the natural environment.

AB Isopods are macrodecomposers in terrestrial ecosystems, contributing to soil organic matter breakdown and nutrient cycling. They have been considered sensitive in laboratory tests designed to evaluate contaminants effects and are considered likely candidates to have a standardized protocol for ecotoxicity tests. For this purpose, a reference substance should be proposed as positive control in laboratory tests. This work aimed to evaluate the avoidance behaviour of the isopod species Porcellio dilatatus to boric acid (H3BO3; BA). Interlaboratory comparison tests were carried out based on the ISO guideline for earthworms, using tropical artificial soil as substrate, in the concentrations of 0, 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1300 and 1800 mg BA kg(-1) soil. Avoidance behaviour was evaluated in group (six organisms per replicate) and in individual tests (one organism per replicate), in dual-section plastic boxes, which received control soil (not contaminated) in one side and tested soil (with BA) in another one. The percentage of organisms in each side was recorded after 48 h, and data were analysed using Fisher exact test (p < 0.05) and t-test. Results showed significant avoidance response in individual tests at 250 mg kg(-1) and in group tests at 500 mg kg(-1). Limited habitat function ( < 20% of organisms) for both tests and laboratories were observed at the highest tested concentration of 1800 mg kg(-1), indicating the low sensitivity of this species to BA in avoidance tests, if compared to other substances in literature. Results showed that BA can be used as reference substance until a better option will be proposed.

AB The in vitro effects of individual brominated flame retardants (BFRs), selected metals, and their binary mixtures on ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity were evaluated using a plate-reader method. The BFRs, 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), decabromodiphenyl oxide (BDE-209), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), were tested at doses ranging from 0.1 ng/L to 100 mu g/L. Selected metals (Cu2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, and Zn2+) were screened at doses of 0.1 mg/L to 50 mg/L. The activity of EROD was significantly induced by TBBPA, BDE-209, and Zn2+, while HBCD, Cu2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ decreased EROD activity. Moreover, following exposure to binary mixtures of metals and BFRs, the EROD activity dose-response curves were similar to those of the metals alone, indicating that EROD activity was governed by the metals.

AB Newly emerged two-dimensional material, black phosphorus (BP) shows promising applications in many fields owing to its superior properties. Despite the biological effects of BP were studied, its environmental impacts have not yet received enough attention. In this study, the bacterial toxicity of exfoliated BP nanosheets was for the first time evaluated against two model bacteria strains, Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis). By monitoring the bacterial growth curve and colony counting, the bacterial toxicity of BP nanosheets was examined. Higher toxicity was induced for Gram-negative E. coli compared to Gram-positive B. subtilis after 6 h treatment, which was reversed at 12 h due to membrane self-healing of E. coli. The bacterial toxicity followed a time- and concentration-dependent fashion, with a maximum bactericidal efficiency of 91.65% and 99.69% for E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively, after 12 h exposure. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)dependent oxidative stress and membrane damage were the main bactericidal mechanisms as proved by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. This study indicates the potential environmental risk of BP nanosheets and the data from this work will guide their safety applications in the future. 1.

AB The livestock wastewater treatment plant represents an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance determinants in the environment. The study explored the prevalence of five antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs, including soli, tetA, qnrD, mphB and mcr-1) and class 1 integron (intI1) in a typical livestock wastewater treatment plant, and analyzed their integrated association with two metal resistance genes (copA and czcA), two pathogens genes (Staphylococcus and Campylobacter), bacterial community and wastewater properties. Results indicated that all investigated genes were detected in the plant. The treatment plant could not completely remove ARGs abundances, with up to 2.2 x 10(4)similar to 3.7 x 10(8) copies/L of them remaining in the effluent. Mcr-1 was further enriched by 27-fold in the subsequent pond. The correlation analysis showed that mphB significantly correlateed with tetA and intl. Mcr-1 strongly correlated with copA. MphB and Intl significantly correlated with czcA. The correlations implied a potential co-selection risk of bacterial resistant to antibiotics and metals. Redundancy analyses indicated that qnrD and mcr-1 strongly correlated with 13 and 14 bacterial genera, respectively. Most ARGs positively correlated to wastewater nutrients, indicating that an efficient reduction of wastewater nutrients would contribute to the antibiotic resistance control. The study will provide useful implications on fates and reductions of ARGs in livestock facilities and receiving environments.

AB Nickel (Ni) emissions resulting from production and transportation raise concerns about the impact of Ni exposure to marine ecosystems. Ni bioavailability models are established for FW systems, but the influence of chemical parameters (e.g. dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) on Ni toxicity within marine systems is less well understood. To examine the effects of DOC concentration and composition on Ni toxicity, acute toxicity tests were conducted on early life-stages of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and sea urchin embryos (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) in full strength sea water (32 ppt). Nine different field collected samples of water with varying concentration (up to 4.5 mg C/L) and composition of DOC were collected from the east coast of the United States. Organic matter compositional analysis included molecular fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopy. The different DOC sources had different protective effects against embryo toxicity. The control (no DOC) Ni 48 h-EC50 for Mytilus embryos was 133 mu g/L (95% confidence interval (C.I.) of 123-144 mu g/L), while Strongylocentrotus embryos displayed control 96-h EC50 values of 207 mu g/L (167-247 mu g/L). The most significantly protective sample had high humic acid concentrations (as determined from fluorescence spectroscopy), which yielded an EC50 of 195 mu g/L (169-222 mu g/L) for Mytilus, and an EC50 of 394 mu g/L (369-419 mu g/L) for S. purpuratus. Among all samples, protection was related to both DOC quantity and quality, with fluorescence-resolved humic and fulvic acid concentrations showing the strongest correlations with protection for both species. These data suggest that DOC is protective against Ni toxicity in M. edulis and S. purpuratus, and that accounting for a DOC quality factor will improve predictive toxicity models such as the biotic ligand model.

AB Infestations with salmon lice, a parasitic copepod, is a major problem in the salmon farming industry. Teflubenzuron is an in-feed pharmaceutical applied to control lice outbreaks; the standard medication is 10 mg per kg fish per day for seven days. Surveys reveal that teflubenzuron accumulates and persists in the sediment around fish farms and causes deformities and mortality in juvenile European lobster (Homarus gammarus), a species commonly found in the vicinity of salmon farms in Norway. To date, there is no information on sub-lethal effects of teflubenzuron on, for example, behavior. We conducted an experiment to assess possible difference in the shelter seeking behavior of teflubenzuron-exposed (N = 19) vs. not exposed (N = 19) H. gammarus juveniles. The teflubenzuron-exposed juveniles had been given very low concentrations, 1.7 mu g per pellet twice per week for 113 days prior to this experiment. The concentration of teflubenzuron was estimated to be less than 1 ng/g lobster when they were tested in the behavior experiment. Animals were placed in a lane with a shelter at one end. Once a lobster had found and entered the shelter, they were repeatedly displaced back to the opposite end of the lane, for a total of 3 repeated runs per animal. Three of the exposed juveniles failed to settle in the shelter, and the remaining teflubenzuron-exposed animals took significantly more time to explore the environment and to find and recognize shelter. Furthermore, exposed lobsters also exhibited slower walking speed compared to the controls. These results demonstrate that teflubenzuron significantly reduces exploratory behavior, learning and activity of juvenile H. gammarus. Thus, exposure to teflubenzuron could increase predation mortality of juvenile lobsters in the wild.

AB The mining and processing of nickel ores from tropical regions contributes 40% of the global supply. The potential impact of these activities on tropical marine ecosystems is poorly understood. Due to the lack of ecotoxicity data for tropical marine species, there is currently no available water quality guideline value for nickel that is specific to tropical species.
   In this study, we investigated the toxicity of nickel to three tropical marine invertebrates, the gastropod Nassarius dorsatus, the barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite, and the copepod Acartia sinjiensis. All toxicity tests used chronic endpoints, namely larval growth, metamorphosis (transition from nauplii to cyprid larvae) and larval development for the snail, barnacle and copepod respectively. Toxicity tests were carried out under environmentally relevant conditions (i.e. 27-30 degrees C, salinity 34-36%s, pH 8.1-8.4). Copper was also tested for quality assurance purposes and to allow for comparisons with previous studies.
   The copepod was the most sensitive species to nickel, with development inhibited by 10% (EC10) at 5.5 (5.0-6.0) mu g Ni/L (95% confidence limits (CL)). Based on EC10 values, the gastropod and barnacle showed similar sensitivities to nickel with growth and metamorphosis inhibited by 10% at 64 (37 - 91) mu g Ni/L and 67 (53 - 80) mu g Ni/L, respectively. Based on existing data available in the literature, the copepod A. sinjiensis is so far the most sensitive tropical marine species to nickel. This study has provided high quality data which will contribute to the development of a water quality guideline value for nickel in tropical marine waters. A species sensitivity distribution of chronic nickel toxicity used the data generated in this paper supplemented by available literature data, comprising 12 species representing 6 taxonomic groups. A 5% hazard concentration (HC5) was determined as 8.2 mu g/L Ni.

AB study investigated the occurrence and sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from arable soils in Beijing and compared them with 4 other types of soils: soil from uncultivated land, an incineration plant, a suburb and a woodland. The total concentrations of PAHs ranged from 189.3 to 888.7 mu g/kg (mean: 518.2 mu g/kg for greenhouses and 455.2 mu g/kg for fields). The seven carcinogenic PAHs accounted for 11.2-81.3% of Sigma 15PAHs in arable soils. Benzo[a]pyrene toxic equivalent (BaPeq) concentrations were 82.8 mu g/kg and 85.4 mu g/kg in greenhouses and fields, respectively. Greenhouses and fields were both dominated by PAHs with 3 and 4 rings. Acenaphthene (ACE), indeno[1,2,3-cd] pyrene (IcdP) and benzo[ghi]perylene (BghiP) were the major compounds. These results showed that there was insignificant difference between the soil from greenhouses and fields and both had low carcinogenic potential risk. The diagnostic ratios suggested that the arable soils were mainly contaminated by coal/biomass combustion. Based on a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, six sources were identified including coal combustion, waste incineration, tar, diesel combustion, biomass burning and gasoline combustion. Coal and gasoline combustion contributed over 40% of the measured PAHs in arable soils. Diesel combustion, tar and waste incineration were the main sources of pollution for soil from the uncultivated land, woodland and incineration plant/suburban. It was concluded that PMF was effective in determining the source apportionment. Urbanization and the evolution of human activities have caused PAH sources to become more complicated in industrial areas compared to regions with little human disturbance. Because of this, various factors need to be considered to control the PAH contamination in arable soils.

AB The metalloid arsenic is highly toxic to all forms of life, and in many countries decontamination of water and soil is still required. Some bacteria have mechanisms to detoxify arsenic and can live in its presence. Actinobacteria are well known for their ability to produce a myriad of biologically-active compounds. In the present study, we isolated arsenic-tolerant Actinobacteria from contaminated water in Saxony, Germany, and determined their ability to produce siderophores able to bind arsenic. The binding capacity of different siderophore-like compounds was determined by a modified chrome azurol S (As-(m)CAS) assay with As(III) at high pH and using CAS decolorization as a readout. Arsenic-tolerant isolates from three actinobacterial genera were identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis: Rhodococcus, Arthrobacter and Kocuria. The isolated Actinobacteria showed a high As(III)-binding activity by siderophore-like compounds, resulting in 82-100% CAS decolorization, as compared to the results with EDTA. The interaction between As(III) and siderophore-like compounds was also detected at neutral pH. In summary, our results suggest that the isolated arsenic-tolerant Actinobacteria produce siderophores that bind arsenic, and open new perspectives on potential candidates for decontaminating environments with arsenic and for other biotechnological applications.

AB The accumulation of arsenic (As) in rice grain is a potential threat to human health. Our study investigated the possible mediatory role of selenite fertilization on As uptake and accumulation by rice (Oryza saliva L.) under different water management regimes (aerobic or flooded) in a pot experiment. Soil solutions were also extracted during the growing season to monitor As dynamics. Results showed that As contents in the soil solutions, seedlings, and mature rice were higher under flooded than under aerobic water management. Under aerobic conditions, selenite additions slightly increased As concentrations in soil solutions (in the last two samplings), but decreased As levels in rice plants. Relative to the control, 0.5 mg kg(-1) selenite decreased rice grain As by 27.5%. Under flooded conditions, however, selenite additions decreased As in soil solutions, while increased As in rice grain. Tendencies also showed that selenite additions decreased the proportion of As in rice shoots both at the seedling stage and maturity, and were more effective in aerobic soil. Our results demonstrate that the effect of selenite fertilizer on As accumulation by rice is related to water management.

AB This study evaluated the ability of Brassica napus for extracting gold (Au), silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) from a mine tailings, with the inoculation of two Aspergillus niger strains, and the application of ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) or ammonium thiosulfate [(NH4)(2)S2O3]. After seven weeks of growth inoculated or non-inoculated plants were applied with 1 or 2 g kg of either NH4SCN or (NH4)(2)S2O3, respectively. Eight days after the application of the chemical compounds, plants were harvested for determining the total dry biomass, and the content of Au, Ag, and Cu in plant organs. Application of (NH4)(2)S2O3 or NH4SCN resulted in enhanced Au accumulation in stems (447% and 507%, respectively), while either (NH4)(2)S2O3 + Aspergillus, or NH4SCN increased the Au-accumulation in roots (198.5% and 404%, respectively) when compared to the control. Treatments with (NH4)(2)S2O3 or (NH4)(2)S2O3+Aspergillus significantly increased (P <= 0.001) the accumulation of Ag in leaves (677% and 1376%, respectively), while NH4SCN + Aspergillus, and (NH4)(2)S2O3 enhanced the accumulation in stems (7153% and 6717.5%). The Ag-accumulation in roots was stimulated by NH4SCN + Aspergillus, and (NH4)(2)S2O3+ Aspergillus (132.5% and 178%, respectively), when compared to the control. The combination of NH4SCN + Aspergillus significantly enhanced the Cu-accumulation in leaves (228%); whereas NH4SCN+ Aspergillus, or (NH4)(2)S2O3+ Aspergillus resulted in greater accumulation of Cu in stems (1233.5% and 1580%, respectively) than the control. Results suggest that either NH4SCN or (NH4)(2)S2O3 (with or without Aspergillus) improved the accumulation of Au and Ag by B. napus. Accumulation of Au and Ag in plant organs overpassed the hyperaccumulation criterion (> 1 mg kg(-1) of plant biomass); whereas Cu-accumulation in stems and roots also overpassed such criterion (> 1000 mg kg(-1)) by applying either NH4SCN or (NH4)(2)S2O3 + A. niger.

AB Samples from two oxidation ditch process municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs) (HJK and GXQ) in two regions of China were analysed for bacteria, particles, total organic carbon, and water-soluble ions in bioaerosols. Diversity and potential pathogen populations were evaluated by high-throughput sequencing. Bioaerosol sources, factors affecting intestinal bacterial survival, and the relationship between bioaerosols and water were analysed by Source tracker and partial least squares-discriminant, principal component, and canonical correspondence analyses. Culturable bacteria concentrations were 110-846 and 27-579 CFU/m(3) at HJK and GXQ, respectively. Intestinal bacteria constituted 6-33% of bacteria. Biochemical reaction tank, sludge dewatering house (SDH), and fine screen samples showed the greatest contribution to bioaerosol contamination. Enterobacter aerogenes was the main intestinal bacteria (> 99.5%) in HJK and detected at each sampling site. Enterobacter aerogenes (98.67% in SDH), Aeromonas sp. (76.3% in biochemical reaction tank), and Acinetobacter baumannii (99.89% in fine screens) were the main intestinal bacteria in GXQ. Total suspended particulate masses in SDH were 229.46 and 141.6 mu g/m(3) in HJK and GXQ, respectively. Percentages of insoluble compounds in total suspended particulates decreased as height increased. The main soluble ions in bioaerosols were Ca2+, Na2+, Cl- and SO42-, which ranged from 3.8 to 27.55 mu g/m(3) in the MWTPs. Water was a main source of intestinal bacteria in bioaerosols from the MWTPs. Bioaerosols in HJK but not in GXQ were closely related. Relative humidity and some ions positively influenced intestinal bacteria in bioaerosols, while wind speed and solar illumination had a negative influence.

AB The characterization of the content and source of heavy metals are essential to assess the potential threat of metals to human health. The present study collected 140 topsoil samples around a Cu-Mo mine (Wunugetushan, China) and investigated the concentrations and spatial distribution pattern of Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu, Mo and Cd in soil using multivariate and geostatistical analytical methods. Results indicated that the average concentrations of six heavy metals, especially Cu and Mo, were obviously higher than the local background values. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis divided these metals into three groups, including Cr and Ni, Cu and Mo, Zn and Cd. Meanwhile, the spatial distribution maps of heavy metals indicated that Cr and Ni in soil were no notable anthropogenic inputs and mainly controlled by natural factors because their spatial maps exhibited non point source contamination. The concentrations of Cu and Mo gradually decreased with distance away from the mine area, suggesting that human mining activities may be crucial in the spreading of contaminants. Soil contamination of Zn were associated with livestock manure produced from grazing. In addition, the environmental risk of heavy metal pollution was assessed by geo-accumulation index. All the results revealed that the spatial distribution of heavy metals in soil were in agreement with the local human activities. Investigating and identifying the origin of heavy metals in pasture soil will lay the foundation for taking effective measures to preserve soil from the long-term accumulation of heavy metals.

AB Heavy metal pollution in farmlands is highly concerned as crops' easy-uptake of heavy metal can ultimately affect consumers. In order to offer suggestions on cultivating safe quality vegetable, specifically eggplant which is widely consumed for its nutritional value and antioxidant activity, a field study was undertaken to investigate the temporal variations and spatial distributions of heavy metals in a wastewater-irrigated soil-eggplant system. In the present study, eggplants were planted in the farmlands of Weichuan village (WC) (relatively unpolluted field), Liangzhuang village (LZ) (moderately polluted field) and Minqin village (MQ) (seriously polluted field) to elucidate their temporal uptake processes of heavy metals described by the sigmoid model. Eggplant tissues from severely polluted farmlands were found with higher heavy metal concentrations and lower yields compared with other two groups. What is more, 25 farmlands along the Dongdagou stream (heavy metals polluted stream) were chosen to analyze the spatial distribution of heavy metals in soils and eggplants. Heavy metal concentrations in eggplants decreased with the decline of heavy metal concentrations in soil from upstream (pollution source) to downstream. Moreover, several methods were employed to assess bioavailability of heavy metals in soils. All the bioavailable heavy metals were found in linear positive correlations with heavy metal concentrations. Meanwhile, linear correlations were found between heavy metals in soils and eggplants. At last, redundancy analysis was used to investigate the effects of soil properties (pH, organic matter and texture of soils) and heavy metals on eggplants' uptake. The results indicated that soil heavy metals had a dominant impact on their accumulations in eggplant fruit, with a variance contribution of 78.0%, while soil properties had a regulatory effect, with a variance contribution of 5.2%.

AB Lead (Pb) is a highly toxic environmental pollutant, and could result in toxic effects on living organisms. The effects of 0, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg of nZVI on plant growth, Pb accumulation and antioxidative responses of Lolium perenne were investigated. Results showed that the total Pb contents in L. perenne with the treatment of low concentrations of nZVI (100, 200 and 500 mg/kg) were higher than those in the non-nZVI treatments, and the highest Pb accumulation capacity of 1175.40 mu g per pot was observed in L. perenne with the treatment of 100 mg/kg nZVI. However, the total Pb contents in L. perenne decreased at high concentrations of nZVI (1000 and 2000 mg/kg). This might be resulted from the decrease of photosynthetic chlorophyll content and the aggravated oxidative stress induced by the high concentration of nZVI, which caused the decrease of plant biomass and metal accumulation capacity in plant. Moreover, the sequential extraction experiments results showed that the lowest acid soluble fraction of Pb in the sediments was found in the treatment with 100 mg/kg of nZVI, indicating that 100 mg/kg was the optimum concentration for nZVI to assist the phytoremediation of Pb-polluted sediment. To conclude, these findings provide a promising method to remediate Pb-polluted sediment by nZVI assisted phytoremediation.

AB To address the rising global demand for food, it is necessary to search for new herbicides that can control resistant weeds. We performed a 2D-quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study to predict compounds with photosynthesis-inhibitory activity. A data set of 44 compounds (quinolines and naphthalenes), which are described as photosynthetic electron transport (PET) inhibitors, was used. The obtained model was approved in internal and external validation tests. 2D Similarity-based virtual screening was performed and 64 compounds were selected from the ZINC database. By using the VEGA QSAR software, 48 compounds were shown to have potential toxic effects (mutagenicity and carcinogenicity). Therefore, the model was also tested using a set of 16 molecules obtained by a similarity search of the ZINC database. Six compounds showed good predicted inhibition of PET. The obtained model shows potential utility in the design of new PET inhibitors, and the hit compounds found by virtual screening are novel bicyclic scaffolds of this class.

AB In this lab-scale study, the feasibility of using kenaf fibers as moving bed biofilm carriers in hybrid microalgal membrane photobioreactors (HMPBR) in organic matter and atrazine elimination from real secondary effluent was evaluated. For evaluating the kinetics of biofilm substrate consumption, an experimental model was proposed. Inoculation of wastewater samples with free carriers resulted in the greater removal of target pollutants. Removal efficiency of atrazine and chemical oxygen demand (COD) increased to 27% and 16%, with respect to the control, respectively. The total biomass accumulation in HMPBR exceeded 5 g/L, and the microalgae tended to aggregate and attached to biofilm carriers. The removal efficiency of HMPBR improved significantly via inoculation of kenaf fiber carriers with bioremediation microalgal strains (p < 0.01). A lower stabilization ratio (VSS/TSS) was also recorded. The biomass in HMPBR included more lipids and carbohydrates. The results revealed that kenaf fibers could improve and upgrade the biological activity of different wastewater treatment applications, considering the great potential of biofilm carriers and their effluent quality.

AB The south-east Asian countries are facing a serious threat of arsenic (As) toxicity due to extensive use of As contaminated groundwater for rice cultivation. This experiment was configured to assess the consequences of rice seed priming with selenium (Se) and cultivation in As free and As contaminated soil. The experiment was arranged in a factorial complete randomized design having two factors viz. seed priming and soil As stress with total twenty-five treatment combinations replicated thrice. Seed priming with Se promotes growth, yield under both As free and As stressed conditions. Se supplementation considerably enhanced the tiller numbers, chlorophyll content, plant height, panicle length and test weight of rice by 23.1%, 23.4%, 15.6% and 30.1%, respectively. When cultivated in As spiked soil and compared with control, Se primed plant enhance growth and yield by reducing As translocation from root to aerial parts, expressed as translocation factor (TF). A reduction of TF (root to shoot) (46.96%), TF (root to husk) (36.78-38.01%), TF (root to grain) (39.63%) can be seen among the Se primed plants than unprimed plants both cultivated in similar As stress. Besides these, a noteworthy reduction in estimated daily intake (EDI) and cancer risk (CR) were also noticed with the consumption of cooked rice obtained after cooking of brown rice of Se primed plants than their unprimed counterparts.

AB The fast-growing resistance development to several synthetic and microbial insecticides currently marketed highlighted the pressing need to develop novel and eco-friendly pesticides. Among the latter, botanical ones are attracting high research interest due to their multiple mechanisms of action and reduced toxicity on non-target vertebrates. Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a key polyphagous insect pest showing insecticide resistance to several synthetic molecules used for its control. Therefore, here we focused on the rhizome essential oil extracted from an overlooked Asian plant species, Cheilocostus speciosus (J. Konig) C. Specht (Costaceae), as a source of compounds showing ingestion toxicity against H. armigera third instar larvae, as well as ovicidal toxicity. In acute larvicidal assays conducted after 24 h, the C. speciosus essential oil achieved a LC50 value of 207.45 mu g/ml. GC and GC-MS analyses highlighted the presence of zerumbone (38.6%), alpha-humulene (14.5%) and camphene (9.3%) as the major compounds of the oil. Ingestion toxicity tests carried out testing these pure molecules showed LC50 values of 10.64, 17.16 and 20.86 mu g/ml, for camphene, zerumbone and alpha-humulene, respectively. Moreover, EC50 values calculated on H. armigera eggs were 35.39, 59.51 and 77.10 mu g/ml for camphene, zerumbone and alpha-humulene, respectively. Overall, this study represents the first report on the toxicity of C. speciosus essential oil against insect pests of agricultural and medical veterinary importance, highlighting that camphene, zerumbone and alpha-humulene have a promising potential as eco-friendly botanical insecticides.

AB Monitoring and assessing toxic materials which are being released into the environment along with wastewater is a growing concern in many industries. The current research describes a highly sensitive and rapid method for the detection of toxic concentrations of heavy metals in aquatic environments. Water samples were collected from southern coasts of the Caspian Sea followed by screening of luminescent bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis, including gene sequence of 16S rRNA, and biochemical tests were performed for identification of the isolate. Luminescence activity was tested and measured after treatment of the isolate with different concentrations of heavy metals and reported as EC50 value for each metal. A luminous, gram negative bacterium with the shape of a curved rod was isolated from the Caspian Sea. Biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the isolate MM1 had more than 99% similarity to Vibrio campbellii. The novel isolate is able to emit high levels of light. Bioluminescence inhibitory assay showed that the Vibrio sp. MM1 had the highest sensitivity to zinc and the lowest sensitivity to cadmium; EC50 values were 0.97 mg 1(-1) and 14.54 mg 1(-1), respectively. The current research shows that even low concentrations of heavy metals can cause a detectable decline in luminescence activity of the novel bacterium Vibrio sp. MM1; hence, it makes a good choice for commercial kits for the purpose of monitoring toxic materials.

AB Arsenic (As) disrupts the biological functions of plants by inhibiting their developmental process. Selenium (Se) is a beneficial plant micronutrient when it is administered at the optimal doses. The present study investigated the possible mediatory role of selenite (Se(IV)) or selenate (Se(VI)) in arsenite (As(III)) or arsenate (As(V)) uptake by rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.). Simultaneous exposure of rice seedlings to As(III) (5 mu M) and Se(IV) (5 mu M) increased the root As content after >= 30 h. The maximum increase in root As level (42.2%) was measured after 150 h. At the same time, the shoot As level decreased by 46.4% as the root-to-shoot As translocation rate declined. In contrast, Se(VI) supplementation caused the As content to decrease by 48.8% and 16.1% after 150 h in the roots and shoots, respectively. Nevertheless, when the As exposure duration was < 48 h, no significant differences in the shoot As levels were detected between treatments. The addition of Se(IV) to the As(V) solution applied to the rice seedlings did not significantly affect root As content but strongly decreased shoot As levels. Se (VI) supplementation had the opposite effect. Lower Se(IV) concentrations slightly increased root As content in seedlings treated with As(III) but strongly decreased shoot As content and the root-to-shoot translocation rate. At lower concentrations, Se(VI) addition significantly decreased both root and shoot As content after 7 d. On the other hand, the root-to-shoot translocation rate did not significantly decrease relative to that observed with the As(III) treatment alone. Our results indicate that Se(IV) could effectively mitigate As translocation from roots to shoots in rice.

AB In order to investigate the tolerance and bioaccumulation of Cd and Cu in the halophyte Sesuvium portulacastrum, seedlings were hydroponically cultured for 30 days using the modified 1/2 Hoagland nutrient solution with different concentrations of Cd (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg L-1) and Cu (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 mg L-1). Afterwards, the seedling height, leaf area, biomass, and mineral element contents (Fe, Mg, Cu, and Zn) in the roots, stems and leaves were measured, and the tolerance index, bioconcentration factor (BCF), transportation index, and removal rate were calculated. The effects of salinity (0 parts per thousand-30 parts per thousand) on the growth and bioaccumulation ability of S. portulacastrum under combined Cu/Cd (5 mg L-1) exposure were also determined. The results showed that, with an increasing Cd concentration, the biomass and seedling height of S. portulacastrum initially increased and then decreased. The highest leaf biomass and seedlings height was observed in the 10 mg L-1 and 5 mg L-1 Cd treatment group, respectively. Salinity did not affect the biomass of S. portulacastrum but decreased Cd concentration in roots and aboveground tissues and Cu concentration in roots of S. portulacastrum. Cu treatment significantly facilitated the absorption of Mg, Cu, and Zn in roots. With an increasing Cu concentration, the Mg and Fe contents increased in the leaves of S. portulacastrum. In comparison to the above-ground portions, the root showed a higher bioaccumulation ability of Cd and Cu, with the BCF of 341.5 and 211.9, respectively. The BCF and translocation factor (TF) values indicated that S. portulacastrum was not a hyperaccumulator for Cd and Cu, but could be used as a phytostablization plant in heavy metal contaminated coastal environments.

AB Copper pyrithione (CuPT) is a biocide, used worldwide to prevent biofouling on submerged surfaces. In aquatic environments it rapidly degrades, however, one of the degradation products (HPT) is known to react with cupric ion back to its parent compound. Not much is known about the behavior and toxicity of CuPT and its degradation product HPT in different water systems. Hence, our aim was to investigate the ecotoxicity of CuPT, HPT as well as Cu2+ to the brine shrimp Artemia salina in natural seawater and organic matter-free artificial seawater. Moreover, in order to elucidate the influence of ionic strength of water on CuPT toxicity, tests were performed in water media with modified salinity. The results showed that CuPT was the most toxic to the exposed crustaceans in a seawater media with the highest salinity and with no organic matter content. HPT in a presence of cupric ion converted to CuPT, but the measured CuPT concentrations and the mortality of A. salina in natural water were lower than in artificial water. The toxicity of CuPT to A. salina was significantly influenced by the organic matter content, salinity, and proportions of constituent salts in water. In a combination with cupric ion, non-hazardous degradation product HPT exhibits increased toxicity due to its rapid transformation to its parent compound.

AB The present study describes bioavailability and chronic effects of bismuth to earthworms Eisenia andrei using OECD reproduction test. Adult earthworms were exposed to natural sandy soil contaminated artificially by bismuth citrate. Average total concentrations of bismuth in soil recovered by HNO3 digestion ranged from 75 to 289 mg/kg. Results indicate that bismuth decreased significantly all reproduction parameters of Eisenia andrei at concentrations >= 116 mg/kg. However, number of hatched cocoons and number of juveniles seem to be more sensitive than total number of cocoons, as determined by IC50; i.e., 182, 123 and > 289 mg/kg, respectively. Bismuth did not affect Eisenia andrei growth and survival, and had little effect on phagocytic efficiency of coelomocytes. The low immunotoxicity effect might be explained by the involvement of other mechanisms i.e. bismuth sequestered by metal-binding compounds. After 28 days of exposure bismuth concentrations in earthworms tissue increased with increasing bismuth concentrations in soil reaching a stationary state of 21.37 mg/kg dry tissue for 243 mg Bi/kg dry soil total content. Data indicate also that after 56 days of incubation the average fractions of bismuth available extracted by KNO3 aqueous solution in soil without earthworms varied from 0.0051 to 0.0229 mg/kg, while in soil with earthworms bismuth concentration ranged between 0.310-1.347 mg/kg dry soil. We presume that mucus and chelating agents produced by earthworms and by soil or/and earthworm gut microorganisms could explain this enhancement, as well as the role of dermal and ingestion routes of earthworms uptake to soil contaminant.

AB Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and Dechlorane Plus (DP) were measured in both human hair and paired serum samples from a cohort of university students in South China. Segmental analysis was conducted to explore gender difference and the relationships between the hair and serum. The concentrations of total PBDEs in the hair and serum samples were in a range of 0.28-34.1 ng/g dry weight (dw) and 0.16-156 ng/g lipid weight (lw), respectively. Concentrations of Sigma DPs (sum of the syn-DP and anti-DP isomers) in all hair samples ranged from nd-5.45 ng/g dry weight. Concentrations of most PBDEs and decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE) in distal segments (5-10 cm from the scalp) were higher than those in the proximal segments (0-5 cm from the scalp) (t-test, p < 0.05), which could be due to the longer exposure time of distal segments. The proximal segments exhibited a unique congener profile, more close to that in the serum rather than the distal segments of hair. An obvious gender difference was found in the levels of Sigma PBDEs using integrated hair samples, while the difference disappeared when considering alone the proximal segments of hair (0-5 cm from scalp) for both genders. This paper provides supplement to the current knowledge on sources of BFRs and DPs in hair and declares the importance of segmental analysis.

AB Seven 1,3,5-triazine (s-triazine) herbicides (ametryn, prometryn, dimethametryn, simazine, atrazine, propazine, and cyanazine) were tested using an amphibian (Silurana tropicalis) metamorphosis assay focusing on morphometric, gravimetric, and thyroid-histological endpoints. Premetamorphic tadpoles were exposed to each s-triazine at 2 concentrations between 1/1000 and 1/10 of the 96-h acute toxicity values, until all tadpoles in the control group reached either the late prometamorphosic stages or the initial stage of metamorphic climax. All s-triazines tested induced significant retardation in growth and development at the higher concentrations (0.2-1.0 mg/L), and some of them induced similar effects even at the lower concentrations (0.02-0.1 mg/L) while each showing a linear dose-response. Total size of the thyroid glands tended to be reduced corresponding to the delayed development, but without showing histomorphological lesions typical of anti-thyroid chemicals. These consistent results suggest that the s-triazines can act as a chemical stressor inhibiting tadpole growth and development, possibly without disrupting the thyroid axis. In addition, tadpoles exhibiting spinal curvatures appeared in either one or both of the lower and higher concentration groups for each s-triazine tested. The incidence rate in the s-triazine exposure groups where tadpoles with scoliosis were observed ranged from 3.3% to 63.3%, some of which were significantly higher than that in the respective control groups (0-6.7%). It is speculated that the s-triazines may promote to occur axial malformations in developing tadpoles.

AB The exposure to combinations of heavy metals can affect the genes of vegetables and heavy metals would accumulate in vegetables and thereby indirectly affecting human health. Exploring the links between genetic changes and phenotypic changes of carrot under the combined pollution of Cd and Cu is of great significance for studying the mechanism of heavy metal pollution. Therefore, this study examined the effects of mixtures of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) on physiological measures (malondialdehyde (MDA), proline, and antioxidant enzyme) and expression of growth-related genes (gibberellin gene, carotene gene, and glycogene) in carrot under greenhouse cultivation. The results showed in the additions with mixtures of Cd and Cu at higher concentration, the MDA content increased significantly (p < 0.05), whereas the proline content was not significantly different from those in the control. In the mixed treatments with high Cd concentrations, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was significantly lower than that in the control (p < 0.05); whereas the activity of peroxidase (POD) increased to different degrees compared to the control. In the additions with mixtures of Cd and Cu, compared with the control, the expression of the gibberellin gene was downregulated from 1.97 to 20.35 times (not including the 0.2 mg kg(-1) Cd and 20 mg kg(-1) Cu mixture, the expression of gibberellin gene in this treatment was upregulated 1.29 times), which lead to decreases in the length and dry weight of carrots. The expression of the carotene gene in mixed treatments downregulated more than that in single treatments, which could reduce the ability of carrots to resist oxidative damage, as suggested by the significant increase in the MDA content. In the addition with mixtures of Cd and Cu, compared with the control, the expression of the glycogene was downregulated by 1.42-59.40 times, which can cause a significant reduction in the sugar content in carrots and possibly further reduce their ability to resist heavy metal damage. A cluster analysis showed that in the additions with mixtures of Cd and Cu, the plant phenotype was affected first, and then with increases in the added concentration, the expression of genes was also affected. In summary, in the additions with mixtures of Cd and Cu, plants were damaged as Cd and Cu concentrations increased.

AB Waterborne exposure to highly persistent microplastic pollutants is a major concern for aquatic species world-wide. There are still gaps in knowledge on microplastics' potential transgenerational effects on offspring generation. Using zebrafish, this study investigated the survival and early development of offspring through a 21-day continuous parental treatment with polystyrene microplastics. The results showed that continuous waterborne exposure to high concentrations (>100 mu g/L) of polystyrene microplastics (1 mu m) for 21 days resulted in notable microplastic accumulation in adult fish intestines. Exposure at microplastic concentrations greater than 100 mu g/L also induced significant changes in steroidogenic mRNA expression in zebrafish gonads. However, no significant changes in the cumulative number of eggs spawned and fertilization rate were observed at any parental exposure concentrations when compared to the control. Early development of derived offspring, in terms of hatching rate, body length, malformation rate and mortality rate, did not significantly differ from that of the control. This study showed that transgenerational effects of parental exposure to polystyrene microplastics in zebrafish might be negligible or recoverable. This study provided new results and insights on the transgenerational effects of microplastics on a freshwater fish species and can help to understand impacts of microplastics on freshwater ecosystems.

AB Water quality guidelines and ecological risk assessment of chemical substances like nickel (Ni) in tropical regions such as South East Asia and Melanesia are often based on temperate information as a result of fewer Ni ecotoxicity data available for tropical species. This leaves an unknown margin of uncertainty in the risk assessment in the tropics. In order to fill this data gap, this study was designed to conduct standard toxicity tests on Ni with two freshwater species (acute tests) and three marine species (acute and chronic tests) originated from tropical Hong Kong. All tests were carried out using measured concentrations of Ni with control mortality below 15%. The median lethal concentrations (LC(50)s) were determined as 2520 (95% confidence interval: 2210, 2860) and 426 (351, 515) mu g Ni L-1 for the freshwater gastropods Pomacea lineata (48 h) and Sulcospira hainanensis (96 h), respectively, while 96 h LC(50)s of 4300 (3610, 5090), 18,200 (6470, 51,200), 62,400 (56,800, 68,500), and 71,700 (68,200, 75,400) mu g Ni L-1 were derived for the marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus, the gastropod Monodonta labio, juvenile and adult of the marine fish Oryzias melastigma, respectively. The chronic effect concentration of 10% (EC10) based on the intrinsic rate of increase of the population of T. japonicus was 29 (12, 69) mu g Ni L-1. In terms of growth inhibition, the chronic EC10 for M. labio was 34 (17, 67) mu g Ni L-1. The results also indicated that T. japonicus in maturation stage (LC10: 484 (349, 919) mu g Ni L-1) was less sensitive than its nauplii stage (LC10: 44 (27, 72) mu g Ni L-1). This study represents an important addition of high-quality toxicity data to the tropical Ni toxicity database which can be used for future ecological risk assessment of Ni and derivation of its water quality guidelines in tropical regions.

AB Human were given a lot of opportunities to ingest TiO2 NPs in the environment. Children have low, sensitive intestinal tolerance, and they could be exposed to higher levels of TiO2 NPs than adults. Few studies have been conducted on the interaction between TiO2 NPs and juvenile intestine phase models. Thus, in this work, weaning rats were orally exposed to TiO2 NPs for 7 and 14 days. Results indicate that Ti accumulated in the intestine, liver, and feces. Inflammatory infiltration damage was observed in the colonic epithelial tissue, and gut microbiota fluctuated with a decreased abundance of Lactobacilli in feces. Oral supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) lessened TiO2 NPs-induced colonic inflammatory injury, which might due to downregulation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B). Meanwhile, LGG maintained normal intestinal microbiome homeostasis, thereby improving TiO2 NPs-induced colon injury in juvenile rats. Moreover, fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) experiment indicated possible TiO2 NPs-induced intestinal microbiota disorder led to colonic inflammation. Our works suggested the urgent need for additional studies on the risk safety assessment, mechanism, and prevention of juvenile health damage from exposure to TiO2 NPs.

AB Quantification and evaluation of the spatial distribution and the primary factors that affect Escherichia coli (E. coli) distribution in soils is important to assess soil pollution and potential contamination of groundwater. However, little information is available on distribution of E. coli in deep soil layers. To analyze the spatial distribution and factors affecting E. coli over a 0-400 cm soil profile, soil samples were collected from two land use type in the sewage irrigation fields. The primary factors dominating the spatial distribution of E. coli were quantified by the model of principal component analysis with multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR). The results indicated that the number of E. coli under cropland decreased greatly with soil depth. The average number of E. coli over the 0-400 cm profile under forestland was 49 x 10(4) colony-forming unit/g (cfu/g), which was significantly higher than that under cropland (20 x 10(4) cfu/g). For forestland and cropland, the average number of E. coli at depths of 300-400 cm decreased by 85% and 88%, respectively, compared to that at depths of 0-100 cm. The presence of E. coli at the depths of 300-400 cm was at high level (forestland: 3 x 10(4) cfu/g; cropland: 2 x 10 4 cfu/g) for the potential risks of shallow groundwater. The PCA-MLR model estimated that the factors of soil organism, soil salt and land type use contributed 28%, 29% and 43%, respectively, to the distribution of E. coli. According to the Monte Carlo simulation, the average number of E. coli over the 0-400 cm profile was 46 +/- 17 x 10(4) cfu/g in the sewage irrigated area, and the interval distribution with a probability of 95% varied between 14 x 10(4) cfu/g and 78 x 10(4) cfu/g. The findings of this study are useful for understanding negative effects of sewage irrigation on pathogens in deep soil and are critical to assess the potential risks of groundwater pollution.

AB Since development of antioxidant defence system is high energy demanding event, innate defence system and stress tolerance of plant is strictly governed by plant age. This study is aimed towards evaluating variation of tolerance in germinating seeds and seedlings of Oryza sativa L. cv. Swarna against nano-scale zero valent iron (nZVI). A comparative study of several physiological and biochemical parameters have been carried out among 2 distinct plant groups, Group I treated with variable concentrations of nZVI (50, 100, 150 and 200 mg L-1) during germination and Group II treated with similar nZVI doses on 7th day after germination. Upon treatment with higher nZVI concentrations, Group I seedlings showed susceptibility towards oxidative stress while Group II seedlings showed tolerance against these higher doses of nZVI. Significant growth enhancement was observed upon treatment with 50-150 mg L-1 nZVI, since up-regulation of plant's endogenous antioxidant system protected relatively aged Group II seedlings from oxidative damages. Hierarchical clustering based on overall physiological, biochemical and stress parameters confirmed that in Group I seedlings 100-200 mg L-1 nZVI treatments were toxic where as in Group II seedlings 50-150 mg L-1 nZVI treatments showed growth promoting effects. This differential response is due to developmental stage related resistance in plants.

AB The high pH and salinity of textile wastewater is a major hindrance to azo dye decolorization. In this study, a mixed bacterial consortium ZW1 was enriched under saline (10% salinity) and alkaline (pH 10.0) conditions to decolorize Methanil Yellow G (MY-G). Consortium ZW1 was mainly composed of Halomonas (49.8%), Marinobacter (30.7%) and Clostridiisalibacter (19.2%). The effects of physicochemical factors were systematically investigated, along with the degradation pathway and metagenome analysis. The co-carbon source was found to be necessary, and the addition of yeast extract led to 93.3% decolorization of 100 mg/L MY-G within 16 h (compared with 1.12% for control). The optimum pH, salinity, temperature and initial dye concentration were 8.0, 5-10%, 40 degrees C and 100 mg/L, respectively. The typical dye-related degradation enzymes were most effective at 10% salinity. Consortium ZW1 was also able to differentially decolorize five other direct and acidic dyes in a short period. Phototoxicity tests revealed the detoxification of MY-G degradation products. Combining UV-vis, FTIR and GC-MS detection, the MY-G degradation pathway by consortium ZW1 was proposed. Furthermore, metagenomic approach was used to elucidate the functional potential of genes in MY-G biodegradation. These results signify the broad potential application of halo-alkaliphilic consortia in the bioremediation of dyeing wastewater.

AB The high-concentration wastewater produced in the industrial reverse osmosis (RO) process contains a large amount of refractory organic matters, which will have serious impacts on the natural environment and human health. Among them, contaminants can be transformed by humus-reducing bacteria based on humus. In this study, O-3- assisted UV-Fenton method was applied as pretreatment. Biological activated carbon (BAC) technology in which humus-reducing bacteria were the dominant bacteria, enhanced by electron donor and Fe3+, was used to dispose of RO concentrate (ROC). The results showed that water treatment process combining oxidation with biological filtration had a positive effect on the removal of stubborn contaminants in ROC. The system was strengthened by adding electron donor and Fe3+, and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was up to 80.1%. However, when the removal efficiency of UV254 absorbing pollutants reached optimal value (87.3%), that means only Fe3+ was added.

AB The potential health risk of trace elements in nut foods has been widely concerned. The accumulations of trace elements by plants in the environment are disturbed by multiple factors. The objective of this work was to investigate the risk levels of trace elements in walnuts and their influence factors (planting area and cultivar). A total of 228 walnut samples were collected from four major walnut producing areas of China. The contents of essential elements for Fe, Cu, Zn, Mo and Se were 35.8, 21.9, 14.8, 0.3 and 0.04 mg/kg, respectively. The contribution of Cu for dietary reference intake was as high as 82.22%. The risk levels of potential toxicological elements and toxic elements within the acceptable limits. Significantly, the hazard quotients (HQs) of Ba and Co were up to 26.14% and 25.31%, respectively. The effect of planting area on trace elements was determined from the aspects of regional distribution and urbanization. Significant differences of essential elements were found between northeast and northwest areas. The urbanization directly influenced toxic elements, which could cause variation up to 85.0% (Pb) and 42.9% (As). Finally, cultivar effect was confirmed that all walnut cultivars were divided into four categories with different trace element characteristics.

AB Selenium (Se) at low concentration is considered benefit element to plants. The range between optimal and toxic concentration of Se is narrow and varies among plant species. This study aimed to evaluate the phenotypic, physiological and biochemical responses of four rice genotypes (BRS Esmeralda, BRSMG Relampago, BRS Bonanca and Bico Ganga) grown hydroponically treated with sodium selenate (1.5 mM L-1). Selenium treated plants showed a dramatically decrease of soluble proteins, chlorophylls, and carotenoids concentration, resulting in the visual symptoms of toxicity characterized as leaf chlorosis and necrosis. Selenium toxicity caused a decrease on shoot and root dry weight of rice plants. Excess Se increased the oxidative stress monitored by the levels of hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation. The enzymatic antioxidant system (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and ascorbate peroxidase) increased in response to Se supply. Interestingly, primary metabolism compounds such as sucrose, total sugars, nitrate, ammonia and amino acids increased in Se-treated plants. The increase in these metabolites may indicate a defense mechanism for the osmotic readjustment of rice plants to mitigate the toxicity caused by Se. However, these metabolites were not effective to minimize the damages on phenotypic traits such as leaf chlorosis and reduced shoot and root dry weight in response to excess Se. Increased sugars profile combined with antioxidant enzymes activities can be an effective biomarkers to indicate stress induced by Se in rice plants. This study shows the physiological attributes that must be taken into account for success in the sustainable cultivation of rice in environments containing excess Se.

AB The largest mercury (Hg) mining district in the world is located in Almaden (Spain), with well-known environmental impacts in the surrounding ecosystem. However, the impact of mercury on the health of the inhabitants of this area has not been documented accordingly. This study aims to carry out a probabilistic human health risk assessment using Bayesian modeling to estimate the non-carcinogenic risk related to Hg through multiple exposure pathways. Samples of vegetables, wild mushrooms, fish, soil, water, and air were analyzed, and adult residents were randomly surveyed to adjust the risk models to the specific population data. On the one hand, the results for the non-carcinogenic risk based on Hazard Quotient (HQ) showed unacceptable risk levels through ingestion of Hg-contaminated vegetables and fish, with HQ values 20 and 3 times higher, respectively, than the safe exposure threshold of 1 for the 97.5th percentile. On the other hand, ingestion of mushrooms, dermal contact with soil, ingestion of water, dermal contact with water and inhalation of air, were below the safety limit for the 97.5th percentile, and did not represent a risk to the health of residents. In addition, the probabilistic approach was compared with the conservative deterministic approach, and similar results were obtained. This is the first study conducted in Almaden, which clearly reveals the high levels of human health risk to which the population is exposed due to the legacy of two millennia of Hg mining.

AB Acid rain is a widespread environmental issue intensely affecting normal plant growth of crops. Melatonin is well known pleiotropic molecule which improves abiotic and biotic stress tolerance of plants through physiological and molecular mediation. However, the impact of exogenous melatonin on molecular activities under acid rain conditions in plants has never been studied. The objective of the study is to expose the possible role of exogenous melatonin on physiological and molecular changes against acid rain stress in tomato. Transcriptome profile through RNA-sequence analysis identified 1228, 1120 and 1537 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in control plant (Ctr) vs simulated acid rain stressed plant (P25) comparison, control plant vs melatonin treatment in simulated acid rain stressed plant (P25M) comparison and P25 vs P25M comparison, respectively. Among them, 152 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were commonly expressed and the expression of secondary metabolites related gene was noticeably observed in all comparison. Moreover, transcript families such as ERF, WRKY, MYB and bZIP related gene accounted more in all treatment comparison. The RNA-sequence and qPCR results indicated that exogenous melatonin is closely associated with acid rain stress moderator and might be involved in alteration of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites and transcriptional factor encoding genes expression which might have potential application against environmental hazardous conditions.

AB Cadmium (Cd) pollution is a worldwide concern due to its biotoxicity. Because Cd and Fe are closely associated during plant photosynthesis, this study aims at investigating the mechanism governing Cd toxicity during photosynthetic primary reaction in rice by adjusting Fe concentration. The results show that moderate Fe concentration (1.0 g kg(-1)) added to soil can increase the stomatal conductance (Gs) and SPAD value by stimulating the stomatal opening and chlorophyll synthesis. Moderate Fe concentration can also improve the maximum fluorescence (Fm) and the maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) to keep the high reaction center activity and electronic transfer efficiency in photosystems I and II. Thus, moderate Fe can eliminate Cd-induced decrease in Gs, intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) as well as the disorder of antioxidative system under Cd concentration of 2.0 mg kg(-1) in the soil. When its application is increased to 2.0 g kg(-1), Fe can notably decrease Pn, and result in remarkable decrease in the biomass of shoots and grains. Decrease in Pn can be mainly attributed to high Fe concentration which can greatly destroy chloroplast structure and, meanwhile, inhibit the electron transfer between acceptor and donator in photosynthetic chain especially from quinone A (Q(A)) to quinone B (Q(B)). Unlike the situation under moderate Fe concentration, the high Fe application cannot mitigate the Cd-induced decrease in photosynthetic index. Our results indicate that the moderate Fe application is necessary to promote rice performance and production and, in the meantime, to inhibit Cd toxicity in the extensively polluted soils.

AB Microplastics and dissolved organic matter (DOM) are ubiquitous in aquatic environments. The adsorption behavior of DOM on microplastics in aquatic environments is a prominent concern. In this study, the adsorption of two types of DOM, Suwannee River Humic Acid (HA) and Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (FA), on polystyrene microplastics (PSMPs, 10 mu m) in aquatic environments was investigated. The adsorption of both HA and FA on PSMPs could be well described by using pseudo second-order and Freundlich models. The adsorption of HA and FA on PSMPs was low pH-dependent, particularly for FA adsorption. However, the elevated ionic strength slightly increased the adsorption of HA and FA on PSMPs. Based on Freundlich model, the site energy distribution of HA and FA adsorption on PSMPs under the experimental conditions were estimated. HA and FA first occupied the high-energy adsorption sites and then diffused to the low-energy adsorption sites on PSMPs. With higher site energies, HA demonstrated a much stronger adsorption affinity to PSMPs than FA. The adsorption site heterogeneity (sigma(e)*) on PSMPs under the experimental conditions were close. Hydrophobic interaction and pi-pi electron donor acceptor interaction acted simultaneously in the HA and FA adsorption on PSMPs. The results of this study suggested that the environmental behaviors of microplastics would be influenced by the amount and the type of DOM as well as solution chemistry.

AB Neonicotinoid insecticides, including imidacloprid, are increasingly being used to control insect pests in agricultural and urban areas, and are often detected in aquatic environments. The effects of neonicotinoids on nontarget insects have been investigated with respect to behavioural, biochemical, physiological and population-level responses, but information of their effects on crustaceans is limited. This study investigated the adverse effects of both acute and chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid on the nutritional quality of adult Black Tiger Shrimp (Penaeus monodon). Shrimp were continually exposed to imidacloprid in water (5 mu g L-1 and 30 mu g L-1), or through their food (12.5 mu g g(-1) and 75 mu g g(-1)), for the entire exposure period. Imidacloprid concentrations in water and residues in tissues were quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry after solid-phase extraction and QuEChER extraction respectively. Within 4 days, shrimp accumulated imidacloprid at up to 0.350 mu g imidacloprid per g body weight from water and food exposure. Chronic exposure resulted in a significant decrease in body weight and total lipid content. Fatty acid composition in exposed shrimp was modified relative to controls. Overall, these results demonstrate that neonicotinoid exposure could lead to nutritional deficiency, which has implications for the productivity and food quality of shrimp.

AB Disposal of e-waste is a global issue and has caused serious pollution in recycling areas. Most of these areas had once developed intensive agriculture and might incur organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) pollution. However, this used to be neglected. Here we discuss the joint effects via analyzing OCPs and heavy metals in a notorious e-waste recycling area. The OCPs showed higher (p = 0.005) pollution levels in soils from agricultural zone than in core e-waste recycling zone, which is opposite for heavy metals (p = 0.02). The OCPs and heavy metals showed the highest concentrations in the open burning site locating in the boundary between the e-waste and agricultural zones. Composition profiles further indicated that the land use changes from agriculture to e-waste industry might accelerate the release of buried OCPs. Worse still, the OCPs and heavy metals might pose carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks to local residents, respectively.

AB Fluorosis is a worldwide public health problem, and its adverse effects on the heart have been confirmed by many studies. Abnormal myocardial contractions are often associated with impairment of cardiac function as a cause or consequence. We designed two-part experiments to search for biomarkers and clarify the underlying molecular mechanism of fluoride on myocardial contraction. First, we used Pressure-volume Loop analysis to evaluate changes in myocardial function indexes with multiple fluoride exposure levels in mice (0, 30, 70, and 150 mg/L) exposed for 4 weeks. The results showed that fluoride exposure affects the heart pump function and reduces cardiac contractility. Then, we established a rat model of fluoride exposure (0, 30, 60, and 90 mg/L) for 6 months to carry out proteomic analysis of fluoride-induced myocardial contractile injury. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was used to determine the severity of myocardial injury, and myocardial tissue samples were submitted for isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (ITRAQ) analysis. A total of 1607 proteins were successfully identified with 294 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in fluoride treated groups. According to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, 12 DEPs were confirmed to be involved in pathways related to myocardial contraction. Furthermore, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for these 12 core DEPs to illustrate the role and location of each DEP in the myocardial contraction pathway. The results of this study are helpful for identify a potential mechanism and biomarkers of fluoride-induced myocardial contraction function damage, moreover, which can provide a new insight into the heart toxicity of fluoride in animals at the proteomics level.

AB The low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of fertilizers and aluminum toxicity are major limiting factors for crop development in red soil (acidic soil) of China. Biochar is a promising material for improving soil quality, alleviating aluminum and acidic toxicity. The present study was conducted on maize to evaluate the effects of biochar on NUE and soil quality under different applications of nitrogen fertilizer. Biochar was used in the following five levels in each pot; C0 (0 g), C1 (7.5 g), C2 (15 g), C3 (30 g), C4 (45 g), in combination with delta N-15 at two N levels: N0 (0 g kg(-1)) and N1 (0.2 g kg(-1)). The biochar increased soil nutrients, exchangeable cation, and SOM. Compared with C0, the K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ were increased by 31.58%, 95.87%, and 463.75% while total Al3+ content of C4 treatment was decreased by 91.98%-93.30% in soil, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) showed that Al2SiO5 was adsorbed on the surface of biochar in the soil due to the special physical structure of biochar. Besides, the results showed that root and shoot biomass increased by 44.5% and 89.6%, respectively under biochar treatment. The nitrogen utilization rate of the plant was increased by 11.08% after the amendment of biochar to soil. The delta N-15 content was increased from 11.97 to 21.32 for root and from 50.84 to 82.33 mg kg(-1) for the shoot. The use of biochar with N fertilizer showed a more positive effect on improving NUE of maize and facilitating soil quality. Our results suggest that biochar could be used to improve soil available nutrients, alleviate aluminum toxicity and acidic toxicity. Therefore, biochar could also increase the NUE of maize by adjusting soil quality.

AB This study aimed at assessing heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cr and Pb) in four perennial halophytes (viz. Heliotropium bacciferum, Halopyrum mucronatum, Ipomoea pes-caprae and Salsola imbricata) growing at two sites on the Karachi coast. Site - II, closer to the Industrial area had higher bioavailability as well as translocation factor (TF) for most of the heavy metals and Na+ where soil sediments had lower pH (approximately 7.5), higher salinity (EC) and organic matter (OM). Site - I which was far from Industrial area had comparatively higher bioconcentration factor (BCF) and lower TF for metal ions and soil pH of 8.1-9. Metal accumulation in plants was both site and species specific. Extractable concentration of shoot Pb in all tested halophytes was above normal of the threshold values (i.e., > 0.3 mg kg(-1)) while Mn (< 50 mg kg(-1)) and Cu (< 40 mg kg(-1)) were within permissible limits. Salsola imbricata had highest Na+ at both sites (site - I = 73; site - II = 98 mg kg(-1)) with and 10 mg kg(-1) extractable shoot Pb at site - I. Ipomea pes-caprae also accumulated shoot Pb higher than normal (site - I = 3.3; site - II = 0.8 mg kg(-1)) with lowest Na+ content. Heliotropium bacciferum had higher extractable Pb (site - I = 10.5; II = 2.75) with > 20 mg kg(-1) Na+ in shoot while maintaining > 1 TF for Pb, Cu, Mn and Zn at site - I and all tested metals at site - II. Halopyrum mucronatum had highest shoot Fe (644 mg kg(-1)), Zn (63 mg kg(-1)) and Cr (9.2 mg kg(-1)) at site - II and above threshold values of Pb at both sites (site - I = 8.2; site II = 2.5 mg kg(-1)) which makes this species an ideal bio-indicator candidate while other species could be potentially used for Pb+ phytoremediation.

AB Accidental ingestion of Pb-contaminated soil particles by direct hand-to-mouth activity or by swallowing air-borne dust particles is important pathway of human exposure to Pb. Appropriate evaluation of Pb risk to human is important in determining whether the soil needs remediation or not, however, there is paucity of data about the dietary influences on Pb bioaccessibility (Pb-BA) and transformation in humans. This study chose two typical foods, spinach and cola, representing vegetable and soft drink, respectively, and investigated their effects on Pb species in gastrointestinal tract using the physiologically based extraction test. Results showed that ingestion of spinach and cola decreased the Pb-BA by 52%-94% in the gastric phase and by 38%-95% in the intestinal phase, respectively. The reduction of Pb-BA by spinach was attributed to the precipitation of Pb with phosphorus in spinach and the sorption of Pb by the generated hydrolysate and un-hydrolysate from spinach in gastrointestinal tract. Cola decreased Pb-BA mainly via formation of insoluble Pb phosphates precipitates. Analysis of X-ray diffraction and MINTEQ modeling demonstrated that the dissolved Pb was transformed to precipitated or sorbed Pb with intake of cola or spinach. Our findings suggest that dietary habit greatly influence the speciation and subsequent Pb-BA in the gastrointestinal tract, which should be incorporated into human health risk assessment of Pb-contaminated soil.

AB Lead is a toxic metal found in environment with great neurotoxic potential. The main effect is associated with impairments in hippocampus and cerebellum, driving to cognitive and motor dysfunctions, however, there is a lack of evidences about the effects over the spinal cord. In this way, we aimed to investigate in vivo the effects of long-term exposure to lead acetate in oxidative biochemistry and morphology of rats' spinal cord. For this, 36 male Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) were divided into the group exposed to 50 mg/kg of lead acetate and control group, which received only distilled water, both groups through intragastric gavage, for 55 days. After the exposure period, the animals were euthanized and the spinal cords were collected to perform the analyses of lead levels quantification, oxidative biochemistry evaluation by levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrites and the antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP). Besides, morphological evaluation with quantitative analysis of mature and motor neurons and reactivity to myelin basic protein (MBP). Our results showed high levels of lead in spinal cord after long-term exposure; there was a reduction on ACAP level; however, there was no difference observed in MDA and nitrite levels. Moreover, there was a reduction of mature and motor neurons in all three regions, and a reduction of immunolabeling of MBP in the thoracic and lumbar segments. Therefore, we conclude that long-term exposure to lead is able of increasing the levels of the metal in spinal cord, affecting the antioxidant capacity and inducing morphological impairments in spinal cord parenchyma. Our results also suggest that the tissue impairments triggered by lead may be resultant from others molecular mechanisms besides the oxidative stress.

AB Release of huge quantities of toxic hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) owing to its widespread use in several industrial and mining activities is a major environmental concern in 21st century. The present in situ vegetation analysis at three study sites gives insight on Cr hyperaccumulation potentiality which evaluates the phytoremediation ability of abundant native weeds growing in and around the Cr contaminated effluent discharge site at South Kaliapani chromite mine area, Odisha, India. Moreover, the study measure the relative bioconcentration of chromium in different plant parts with analysis of uptake related phytoremediation indices viz. Bioconcentration factor (BCF), Transportation index (Ti), Translocation factor (TF) and Metal Extraction Ratio (MER) to assess hyperaccumulation potentiality. Vegetation study near mine effluent discharge site (Site-1) reported maximum abundance for Diectomis fastigiata (8.25) followed by Vernonia cinerea (7.6) with Ti values 56 and 657 respectively. In site-2 (uncultivated barren land near site-1), Crown sparsiflorus showed maximum abundance (6.7) followed by Tephrosia purpurea (5.8) with Ti values 95.2 and 87.8 respectively whereas Kyllinga monocephala reported maximum abundance (6.1) followed by Fern sps. (5.9) with Ti values 62.4 and 81.1 respectively in site-3 (a swampy land flooded with chemically treated mine waste effluent). The highest Cr concentrations was recorded in roots of Diectomis fastigiata (2371 mg/kg dry matter) and shoot of Vernonia cinerea (5500 mg/kg dry matter) indicating their Cr phytoremediation potential. Moreover, the study provides the early indicative tools for detecting native Cr hyperaccumulators growing in an in situ environment with an in situ phytoremediation perspective.

AB Soil salinization is one of most crucial environmental problems around the world and negatively affects plant growth and production. Carex rigescens is a turfgrass with favorable stress tolerance and great application prospect in salinity soil remediation and utilization; however, the molecular mechanisms behind its salt stress response are unknown. We performed a time-course transcriptome analysis between salt tolerant 'Huanghua' (HH) and salt sensitive 'Beijing' (BJ) genotypes. Physiological changes within 24 h were observed, with the HH genotype exhibiting increased salt tolerance compared to BJ. 5764 and 10752 differentially expressed genes were approved by transcriptome in BJ and HH genotype, respectively, and dynamic analysis showed a discrepant profile between two genotypes. In the BJ genotype, genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and stress response were more active and ABA signal transduction pathway might play a more important role in salt stress tolerance than in HH genotype. In the HH genotype, unique increases in the regulatory network of transcription factors, hormone signal transduction, and oxidation-reduction processes were observed. Moreover, trehalose and pectin biosynthesis and chitin catabolic related genes were specifically involved in the HH genotype, which may have contributed to salt tolerance. Moreover, some candidate genes like mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidase and EG45-like domain-containing protein are highlighted for future research about salt stress resistance in C. rigescens and other plant species. Our study revealed unique salt adaptation and resistance characteristics of two C. rigescens genotypes and these findings could help to enrich the currently available knowledge and clarify the detailed salt stress regulatory mechanisms in C. rigescens and other plants.

AB The risk of heavy metal cadmium (Cd) on aquatic organisms has drawn widespread attentions, but the effects of nanomaterials (e.g. graphene (G)) on Cd toxicity are rarely clarified. It was known that mixture of contaminants may exhibit more severe impact than the individual metal. Here, we conducted a study systematically on the effects of nanomaterials on the toxicity of Cd to Scenedesmus Obliquus (S. obliquus) with or without the presence of graphene family materials (GFMs) derived from G, such as graphene oxide (GO) and amine-modified graphene (GNH). Our results showed that the influence of GFMs on the acute toxicity of Cd to S. obliquus is in the order of GO > G > GNH based on their EC50 of Cd-GFMs. The effects of GFMs on the cytotoxicity and oxidative damage of Cd to S. obliquus are varied with the concentrations of GFMs. The differences between the effects of GFMs on Cd toxicity may attribute to their different surface oxygen-containing functional groups contained in the nanomaterials. The adsorption capacity of nanomaterials on metal ions, their dispersibility in water and their interaction mode with organisms, may dominate main contributions to their effects on Cd toxicity. Our study aids to clarify the interference of nanoparticles on the ecotoxicity of metals, to avoid the misunderstanding of the potential risk of metals in the complicate water environments.

AB In this study, ultrasonic as a pretreatment coupled with bioleaching was used to enhance sludge dewaterability. Changes in microbial diversity and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) were studied during the combined treatment process. The results show that under optimal conditions, combined ultrasonic and bioleaching treatment led to decreases in the specific resistance of filtration and bioleaching time by 7.59% and 12.5%, respectively, compared with single bioleaching process. Using high pressure filtration system, the water content of sludge cake treated by the combined treatment was decreased to 58.04%, which was 10.04% lower than bioleaching sludge. After combined treatment, the microbial diversity and the total number of bacteria in the sludge decreased significantly, which caused the decreases in the absolute abundance of sulfonamide and tetracycline ARGs by 1.56-1.58 and 0.34-1.23 log units, respectively. However, the decrease in the total bacterial biomass was greater than the decrease in the number of potential hosts carrying the tetracycline ARG, resulting in an increase in the relative abundance of tetracycline gene. Furthermore, this study proposed a mechanism of the dewatering and ARGs, involving the combined ultrasonic and bioleaching treatment: Firstly, ultrasonic cavitation causes extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to fall off the surface of sludge; Secondly, this faster and directly makes bacteria cells affected by bio-acidification and bio-oxidation. In this case, the cells could be more easily destroyed by the combined ultrasonic and bioleaching treatment, compared with individual bioleaching treatment; As a result, stronger dewaterability and more removal rates of ARGs were achieved under the combined treatment. The economic analyses showed that the combined ultrasonic and bioleaching treatment is a more practical and economical technique for achieving deep dewatering of sludge.

AB Glutaredoxins (Grxs) are small multifunctional redox proteins. Grxs have glutathione-dependent oxidoreductase activity in the presence of glutathione reductase and NADPH. The role of Grxs is well studied in heavy metal tolerance in prokaryotic and mammalian systems but not in plant genera. In the present study, a chickpea glutaredoxin (CaGrx) gene (LOC101493651) has been investigated against metal stress based on its primary screening in chickpea which revealed higher up-regulation of CaGrx gene under various heavy metals (AsIII-25 mu M, AsV-250 mu M, Cr(VI)-300 mu M, and Cd-500 mu M) stress. This CaGrx gene was overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana and investigated various biochemical and physiological performances under each metal stress. Transgenic plants showed significant up-regulation of the CaGrx gene during qRT-PCR analysis as well as longer roots, higher seed germination, and survival efficiency during each metal stress. The levels of stress markers, TBARS, H2O2, and electrolyte leakage were found to be less in transgenic lines as compared to WT revealed less toxicity in transgenics. The total accumulation of AsIII, AsV, and Cr(VI) were significantly reduced in all transgenic lines except Cd, which was slightly reduced. The physiological parameters such as net photosynthetic rate (P-N), stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration (E), water use efficiency (WUE), photochemical quenching (qP), and electron transport rate (ETR), were maintained in transgenic lines during metal stress. Various antioxidant enzymes such as glutaredoxin (GRX), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), antioxidant molecules (ascorbate, GSH) and stress-responsive amino acids (proline and cysteine) levels were significantly increased in transgenic lines which provide metal tolerance. The outcome of this study strongly indicates that the CaGrx gene participates in the moderation of metal stress in Arabidopsis, which can be utilized in biotechnological interventions to overcome heavy metal stress conditions in different crops.

AB Phenols and parabens are two major classes of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) that may be related to multiple human diseases. However, there has been no studies examining the association between phenols as well as parabens and osteoarthritis (OA). We assessed the link between urinary concentrations of triclosan (TCS), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), bisphenol A (BPA), and parabens with OA based on the data collected from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in multivariable logistic regression models. Among all the 7114 participants included, the weighted percentage of OA was 12.11% (n = 807). Compared with participants at tertile 1, those at tertile 2 of urinary BP-3, and tertile 3 of urinary BP-3 were more likely to show increased OA prevalence in a fully adjusted model, with odd ratio (OR) as 1.34 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.78], 1.55 (95 CI%: 1.17-2.06), and 1.66 (95 CI%: 1.23-2.24), respectively. In subgroup analyses stratified by potential confounders, various subgroups remained to show statistically significant positive association between urinary BP-3 and OA prevalence. Otherwise, we observed no statistically significant associations between urinary TCS, BPA or parabens with OA. In conclusion, this serves as the first study in which we found that the urinary concentration of BP-3 was positively correlated to prevalence of OA among the US population.

AB Despite the well-known acknowledgement of both the toxicity of cadmium (Cd) and the ameliorative effect of selenium (Se), the mechanism of the protective effect of selenium on cadmium-induced Mouse Leydig (TM3) cell apoptosis remains unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is involved in anti-apoptosis of selenium against cadmium in TM3 cells. We found that exposure to cadmium caused evident cytotoxicity, in which cell viability was inhibited, followed by inducement of apoptosis. Moreover, the level of ROS generation was elevated, leading to the phosphorylation of JNK. In addition, following cadmium exposure, the nuclear transcription factor c-jun was significantly activated, which led to increased expression of downstream gene c-jun, resulting in downstream activation of the apoptosis-related protein Caspase3 and upregulation of Cleaved-PARP, as well as inhibition of the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2. However, pretreatment with selenium remarkably suppressed cadmium-induced TM3 cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the level of ROS declined, and the JNK signaling pathway was blocked. Following this, the gene expression of c-jun decreased while Bcl-2 increased, which was consistent with the effects on proteins, that Caspase3 activity and Cleaved-PARP were inhibited while Bcl-2 level was restored. In order to explain the relationship between molecules of the signaling pathway, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), the ROS inhibitor, and JNK1/2 siRNA were administered, which further indicated the mediatory role of the ROS/JNK/c-jun signaling pathway in regulating anti-apoptosis of selenium against cadmium-induced TM3 cell apoptosis.

AB A large amount of organic fertilizer application could be accompanied by soil contamination caused by trace heavy metals. A field experiment was carried out in this study to examine the accumulation and availability of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in soil, and their uptake by rice under continuous application of chicken manure, pig manure and sewage sludge. Results showed that after four years of chicken manure, pig manure and sewage sludge application, the soil Cu accumulation rates were 0.15-1.17 mg kg(-1) yr(-1), 1.01-4.22 mg kg(-1) yr(-1) and 0.13-1.15 mg kg(-1) yr(-1), respectively; Zn accumulation rates were 0.54-5.46 mg kg(-1) yr(-1), 1.51-9.65 mg kg(-1) yr(-1)1 and 1.13-10.47 mg kg(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Compared to the control, the chicken- and pig manure treatments significantly decreased the DTPA-extractable Cu, but increased the DTPA-extractable Zn in soils; thus decreased the Cu contents in rice grain by 2.2-40.6% and increased the grain Zn by 2.6-30.9%, respectively, with increasing application rates and number of years. The addition of sewage sludge significantly increased bioavailability of Zn in soil and its accumulation in rice, while had limited effect on Cu bioavailability. Results suggested that the continuous application of organic fertilizer with elevated Cu and Zn contents at high application rates can induce their accumulation in soil and affect their bioavailability differently.

AB Health risks induced by PM2.5 have become one of the major concerns among living populations, especially in regions facing serious pollution such as China and India. Furthermore, the composition of PM2.5 is complex and it also varies with time and locations. To facilitate our understanding of PM2.5-induced toxicity, a predictive modeling framework was developed in the present study. The core of this study was 1) to construct a virtual carbon nanoparticle library based on the experimental data to simulate the PM2.5 structures; 2) to quantify the nanoparticle structures by novel nanodescriptors; and 3) to perform computational modeling for critical toxicity endpoints. The virtual carbon nanoparticle library was developed to represent the nanostructures of 20 carbon nanoparticles, which were synthesized to simulate PM2.5 structures and tested for potential health risks. Based on the calculated nanodescriptors from virtual carbon nanoparticles, quantitative nanostructure-activity relationship (QNAR) models were developed to predict cytotoxicity and four different inflammatory responses induced by model PM2.5. The high predictability (R-2 > 0.65 for leave-one-out validations) of the resulted consensus models indicated that this approach could be a universal tool to predict and analyze the potential toxicity of model PM2.5, ultimately understanding and evaluating the ambient PM2.5-induced toxicity.

AB One of the major mechanisms of heavy metal toxicity is the induction of oxidative stress. Redox-active heavy metals, like chromium, can induce it directly, whereas redox-inactive metals, like cadmium, play an indirect role in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Living organisms defend themselves against oxidative stress taking advantage of low-molecular-weight antioxidants and ROS-detoxifying enzymes. Tocopherols and plastoquinol are important plastid prenyllipid antioxidants, playing a role during acclimation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to heavy metal-induced stress. However, partial inhibition of synthesis of these prenyllipids by pyrazolate did not decrease the tolerance of C. reinhardtii to Cr- and Cd-induced stress, suggesting redundancy between antioxidant mechanisms. To verify this hypothesis we have performed comparative analyses of growth, photosynthetic pigments, low-molecular-weight antioxidants (tocopherols, plastoquinol, plastochromanol, ascorbate, soluble thiols, proline), activities of the ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and cumulative superoxide production in C. reinhardtii exposed to Cd2+ and Cr2O72- ions in the presence or absence of pyrazolate. The decreased alpha-tocopherol and plastoquinol content resulted in the increase in superoxide generation and APX activity in pyrazolate-treated algae. The application of heavy metal ions and pyrazolate had a pronounced impact on Asc and total thiol content, as well as SOD and APX activities (the latter only in Cd-exposed cultures), when compared with algae grown in the presence of heavy metal ions or pyrazolate alone. The superoxide production in cultures exposed to heavy metal ions and pyrazolate decreased when compared to the cultures exposed to either heavy metal ions or an inhibitor alone.

AB The use of nitrification inhibitors (NIs) such as 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) has been suggested to diminish agricultural soil nitrate (NO3-) loss and increase nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE). However, the yield of ammonium (NH4+)-sensitive plants such as spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) may be adversely affected by the application of NIs at high N levels and, on the other hand, the efficiency of the NIs may also be affected by soil amendments such as biochar. These two issues are still not adequately addressed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different N levels including DMPP or not in a calcareous soil with and without amendment of wheat straw biochar on spinach yield, NUE, nitrate concentration of spinach leaf, activity of enzymes nitrate reductase (NR) and nitrite reductase (NiR), and soil ammonium (NH4+) and NO3- concentration under greenhouse conditions. This experiment was carried out with different N rates factor at seven levels (un-fertilized, N0; fertilized with 50 mg N kg(-1) soil, N50; fertilized with 75 mg N kg(-1) soil, N75; fertilized with 100 mg N kg(-1) soil, N100; fertilized with N50 + DMPP; fertilized with N75 + DMPP; and fertilized with N100 + DMPP) and biochar (BC) factor at two levels (0, 0%BC; and 2% (w/w), 2%BC) with six replications over a 56-day cultivation period of spinach. Results showed that the application of DMPP had no significant effect on the yield of spinach plant at low and medium levels of N (50 and 75 mg N kg(-1) soil), but decreased the yield of this plant at the higher level of N (100 mg N kg(-1) soil). However, application of BC decreased the negative effect of DMPP on spinach yield as the yield in spinach plants fertilized with N75 + DMPP and N100 + DMPP significantly increased. Both application of DMPP and addition of BC to soil decreased leaf NO3- concentration by 29.2% and 16.3% compared to control, respectively. Biochar compared to control decreased NR activity by 46.3%. With increasing N rate, NR and NiR activities increased, but DMPP decreased the activities of both enzymes. Biochar reduced the efficiency of DMPP as soil NH4+ concentration was higher in the treatments containing DMPP without BC at 56 days after planting. Biochar and DMPP could increase the quality of spinach plant through decreasing the leaf NO3- concentration. In general, wheat straw biochar counteracted DMPP-mediated negative effect on growth of spinach plant at high level of N by decreasing the efficiency of this inhibitor. These results provide the useful information for managing the application rate of N fertilizers including DMPP in biochar-amended soil.

AB Jasmonic acid (JA) is an important phytohormone, which among others may be involved in the regulation of plant accumulating heavy metal. This experiment was designed to explore the effects of exogenous JA on the responses of alfalfa to Cu stress (100 mu M) in Hoagland solution. When 1, 5 or 10 mM JA was added to the treatment with Cu addition, Cu concentrations in roots and leaves of alfalfa were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) to some extents compared to the treatment without JA addition. The biomasses of roots and leaves of alfalfa in treatments of JA additions were significantly increased (p < 0.05) compared to the Cu stress treatment. Similarly, the concentrations of Chlorophyll, antioxidant enzyme activities, MDA and H2O2 were improved accordingly. But these factors of JA were not improved further when its concentration added in media was the highest (10 mM), indicating its improvement roles were limited. These results suggested that there were positive roles of exogenous JA on alfalfa decreased its Cu accumulation and toxicities might via reduced oxidative stress.

AB In this work, the shuttle-like CeO2 modified g-C3N4 composite was synthesized and was combined with persulfate (PS) for the efficient photocatalytic degradation of norfloxacin (NOR) under visible light. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were used to characterize the structural and optical properties of the as-prepared catalysts. Active species trapping experiments demonstrated that additional sulfate radicals (center dot SO4-) formed upon the addition of PS which could cooperate with superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)), holes (h(+)) and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) to decompose NOR. Singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) was also formed during the reaction and acted as an important active species. The degradation products of NOR were also identified and analyzed by using LC-MS technology, and the possible degradation mechanism and pathways were proposed and discussed. This work indicated that the shuttle-like CeO2 modified g-C3N4 coupled with PS displayed promising applications in the field of pharmaceutical wastewater purification.

AB Over the last few decades, the threat posed to biodiversity and ecosystem function by atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has been increasingly recognized. The disturbed nutrient balance and species composition of plants induced by higher N deposition can impact the biodiversity of the organisms that consume the plants. In this research, we implemented several experiments to estimate the effects of increased N deposition on the growth, survival, and nutrients of the dominant epiphytic lichens in the subtropical mountains in Central China to assess the lichen food amount and nutritional quality for two endangered primates endemic to China. Our results indicated that the thallus growth and propagule survival of the lichens were significantly decreased when nitrogen addition changed from 6.25 to 50.0 kg N.ha(-1).y(-1); it was also shown that lichen biomass could be decreased by 11.2%-70.2% when the deposition addition exceeded 6.25 kg N.ha(-1).y(-1). Further, our study revealed that increased nitrogen deposition also reduced the nutritional quality of the lichens via reducing the soluble protein and soluble sugar levels and increasing the fiber content, which would substantially affect the diet selection of the plants consumers in the region, particularly the populations of the two lichen-eating endangered primate species, Rhinopithecus roxellana and R. bieti. Our experimental study suggested that the nitrogen pollution derived from anthropogenic activities could cause cascading effects for the whole forest ecosystem of Central China; thus, more studies about nitrogen deposition in this region are required.

AB Pollinator populations are in decline worldwide. Multiple factors have been cited as potential causes to these declines. In honey bees, a combination of stressors is known to cause colony losses. Adequate nutrition is a key factor for honey bee growth and colony development. Several studies show that the nutritional quality of the diet is directly proportional to the ability of the bee to face challenges or stressors. We explored the effect of p-coumaric (600 mu M) and indole-3-acetic acid (2, 20 or 200 mu M) supplementation on the survival and activity of key detoxification enzymes of honey bees exposed to tau-fluvalinate. The dietary supplementation with p-coumaric and indole-3-acetic acids (20 mu M) enhanced the survival of bees exposed to tau-fluvalinate (approximately 20%). We also showed that dietary p-coumaric acid increased the levels of cytochrome P450 and glutathione reductase activity in bees treated with tau-fluvalinate, as well as in the untreated controls, while glutathione-S-transferase activity was lower in treated bees than in untreated. In bees fed with indole-3-acetic acid, cytochrome P450 showed increased levels, however, glutathione-S-transferase showed the lowest activity. Moreover, the results showed that supplementation with p-coumaric and indole-3-acetic acids did not alter acetyl cholinesterase activity, nor did treatment with tau-fluvalinate. Altogether, the enzymatic changes related to the detoxification mechanisms observed in bees that were fed with p-coumaric and indole-3-acetic acids could be responsible for the increased survival of bees treated with tau-fluvalinate compared to those that received a control diet. The results presented in this study, together with previous studies, provide evidence of the importance of dietary phytochemicals in the response of honey bees to pesticide exposure. Moreover, these results are the first report of the beneficial effect of the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid on the survival of honey bees treated with tau-fluvalinate.

AB Excess iron (Fe) is commonly observed in wetland rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants, impairing crop growth and productivity. Some information suggests that silicon (Si) can reduce Fe content in leaves and roots of rice (vegetative phase), but nothing is known if Si could mitigate the effects of Fe toxicity on rice production and photosynthesis. Here, we assessed the role of Si in alleviating the well-known effects of Fe toxicity on nutritional imbalances, biomass accumulation, photosynthesis and grain yield using two rice cultivars having differential abilities to tolerate excess Fe. Plants were hydroponically grown under two Fe levels (25 mu M or 5 mM) and the nutrient solutions were amended with Si (0 or 2 mM). Under excess Fe were detected (i) nutritional deficiencies, especially of calcium and magnesium in leaves; (ii) negligible changes in grain nutritional composition, independently of Si application; (iii) decreases in net photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance and electron transport rate, in parallel to decreased grain yield components (total grain biomass, 1000-grain mass, percentage of filled grains, number of grains per plant and harvest index), especially in the Fe-sensitive cultivar. These impairments were partially reversed by the application of Si. Results also suggest that Si alleviated the negative impacts of Fe on spikelet sterility. In summary, we conclude that the use of Si can be recommended as an effective management strategy to reduce the negative impacts of Fe toxicity on rice photosynthetic performance and crop yield.

AB Ceratophyllum demersum is a submerged aquatic angiosperm which is fast growing in contaminated water. This plant has no roots and so takes up nutrients from the water column without the complicating factor of differential shoot/root uptake of nutrients. This study aimed to compare the bioaccumulative capacities of Cu, Zn and their combination by C. demersum and physiological responses (growth, chlorophyll content, and photosynthetic rate) of C. demersum to Cu and Zn. Additionally, pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) technology and integrating sphere spectrometer were applied to detect copper and zinc toxicity effects on the light reactions of photosynthesis C. demersum is an aquatic plant that could be a good accumulator of Cu and Zn in actual solution in the water column. Additionally, RGR (relative growth rate) and chlorophyll content of C. demersum show that toxic effects of Cu or Zn increased over time. Cu and Zn effects manifested themselves more slowly than expected: at least 5 to 10 d were needed for noticeable effects both macroscopically (physical appearance), biochemical (chlorophyll content) and from measurements of photosynthesis using Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) fluorometry. Moreover, the combination of Cu and Zn caused more toxic effect than either Cu or Zn separately. Whole plant scans using an integrating sphere spectrophotometer showed that Cu, Zn and Zn + Cu toxicity effects could be identified from spectral scans but were not specific enough for Cu, Zn and Zn + Cu toxicity to be distinguished from one another.

AB Human exposure to arsenic (As) through rice consumption is a global food safety issue, especially in Southeast Asia. To investigate the impacts of biochar amendment (rice husk and smooth cordgrass-derived biochar) and/or silicate fertilizer on As mobility/phytoavailability in soil and on As accumulation in rice, pot and microcosm experiments were conducted. The results showed that both single application of low doses of biochar (0.5%, w/w) and coapplication of biochar with silicate fertilizer decreased As levels in grain (brown rice) by 14-16%, but not in straw and roots. The biodilution of As in grain resulting from increased grain biomass (by 6-21%) could be mainly a response to the decline in grain As levels with biochar and/or silicate fertilizer amendment. However, both applications exerted limited effects to decrease the overall As uptake by rice grain and straw, potentially due to the small changes in As mobility/phytoavailability in amended soil relative to the control, although plant-available silicon (Si) from amendment could potentially inhibit As uptake. Furthermore, microcosm-based anaerobic incubation experiments demonstrated that As levels in soil solution increased (up to 11-14-fold) with increasing doses of biochar amendment (up to 5%, w/w), possibly due to biochar enhancing the reductive dissolution of iron (oxyhydr) oxides via an increase in the total number of iron-reducing bacteria (up to 1.6-3.2-fold). Our findings suggested that a low application rate of biochar may not be a very effective approach for mitigating As accumulation in rice, while a high application rate could enhance the health risk of As in As-contaminated flooded soil.

AB This study was aimed to investigate an effectual level of Annona muricata (soursop) extracts on mosquito vectors namely, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus. The toxicity study on non-target organism and other important biochemical marker enzymes to find and illustrate the exact mechanism of specific enzymes responsible for detoxifying allelochemicals. Among the various soursop seed kernel extracts tested for larvicidal activity, the 0.9% saline extract exhibited maximum mortality (100%) against three vectors at the lowest concentration for 24 h exposure. Based on these findings, the saline extract was opted for further studies including toxicity on non-target organism and systemic effects on important biochemical constituents in the larvae A. aegypti at the lethal threshold time (18 h) with LC50 concentration (0.009 mg/mL). The tested extract against non-target aquatic fourth instar larvae Chironomus costatus was safe up to 0.0028 mg/mL for 24 h exposure and the mortality was observed only above the concentration 0.0028 mg/mL used in the study. The systemic effects on main neuron transmitter Acetylcholinesterase (p <= 0.01), xenobiotics detoxifying enzyme of alpha-and beta-carboxylesterase (p <= 0.05; p <= 0.01) and antioxidant enzyme glutathione S-transferase (p <= 0.05) were reduced significantly in quantitative analysis. Analysis of such biochemical constituents of proteins and enzymes alpha-and beta-carboxylesterase were considerably down regulated in the resolving native-PAGE. In contrast, acid and alkaline phosphatase were upregulated in both quantitative and qualitative analysis. This investigation clearly demonstrates the soursop extract has potent larvicidal agent with alterations in biochemical constituents of exposed larvae of A. aegypti.

AB Azadirachtin, as the most promising and effective botanical insecticide, exhibits significant growth inhibition activity against agricultural and forestry pests. However, its biochemical effects at the metabolic level compared with those of other insect growth regulators have not been studied. Therefore, in this study, a GC-MS based untargeted metabolomics approach was applied to compare azadirachtin with pyriproxyfen (a juvenile hormone analog) and tebufenozide (a molting hormone analog) in terms of their metabolic effects on Bactrocera dorsalis larvae.
   The bioactivity of azadirachtin against B. dorsalis larvae was significantly different than those of pyriproxyfen and tebufenozide. A total of 693 mass features were recognized, and 112 metabolites were identified in this study. The results showed that a total of 16, 13 and 10 differentially regulated metabolites corresponding to 12, 5 and 8 pathways occur in Aza versus CK, Pyr versus CK and Teb versus CK group, respectively. Further analysis showed that 6 differentially regulated metabolites corresponding to 5 key pathways could be the primary differential metabolic response of B. dorsalis larvae to the three insect growth regulators. The pathways were myoinositol corresponding to ascorbate and aldarate metabolism as the specific response of B. dorsalis larvae to azadirachtin; xylitol, xylulose and 3-aminopropionitrile corresponding to pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and cyanoamino acid metabolism as the common responses to azadirachtin and pyriproxyfen; and 3-hydroxypropionic acid and beta-alanine corresponding to propanoate metabolism and beta-alanine metabolism as the specific responses to tebufenozide.
   The results showed that the metabolic response of B. dorsalis larvae to azadirachitin is closer to that of pyriproxyfen than tebufenozide. The differentially regulated metabolites and pathways responsible for this difference are discussed.

AB Toxicity of 13 ionic liquids (ILs) corresponding to different families were studied by inhibition respiration assays (15 min) using activated sludge. Toxicity increased as increasing the number of carbons in the alkyl -chain of imidazolium-based ILs, with EC50 values from 4.19 to 0.17 for 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Emim] [Cl]) and 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Omim] [Cl]), respectively. An increase in toxicity was observed for aromatic -based ILs (pyridinium- and imidazolium-based ILs) due to the hydrophobic character of the head groups in comparison with linear structures as phosphonium and ammonium cations. Among to the anions studied fixing [Emim](+) as cation, [HSO4](-) and [NTf2](-) presented low EC50 values (0.34 mM and 1.69 mM, respectively) while [Cl](-) and [EtSO4](-) were considered harmless anions due to the hydrophilic character of chloride and the organic nature of [EtSO4](-). ILs toxicity/inhibition was determined by adding a biodegradable compound and measuring the sludge response after being in contact with the ILs for at least 15 h. The exposure of sewage sludge to ILs for more than 15 min used in short inhibition assays caused more toxic effect on microorganisms, even for [Choline] [NTf2], previously defined as practically harmless (EC50 = 2.79 mM). Biodegradability assays confirmed the biodegradable nature of choline cation, related with TOC conversion of 40%, only due to cation consumption. No oxygen consumption or even lysis of microbial cells was observed for Tetrabutylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and for 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogensulphate due to the presence of anions previously defined as hazardous ([NTf2](-) and [HSO4](-)), maintaining their recalcitrant character to sewage systems.

AB Marine biofouling represents a global economic and ecological challenge. Some marine organisms produce bioactive metabolites, such as steroids, that inhibit the settlement and growth of fouling organisms. The aim of this work was to explore bile acids as a new scaffold with antifouling (AF) activity by using chemical synthesis to produce a series of bile acid derivatives with optimized AF performance and understand their structure-activity relationships. Seven bile acid derivatives were successfully synthesized in moderate to high yields, and their structures were elucidated through spectroscopic methods. Their AF activities were tested against both macro- and microfouling communities. The most potent bile acid against the settlement of Mytilus galloprovincialis larvae was the methyl ester derivative of cholic acid (10), which showed an EC50 of 3.7 mu M and an LC50/EC50 > 50 (LC50 > 200 mu M) in AF effectiveness vs toxicity studies. Two derivatives of deoxycholic acid (5 and 7) potently inhibited the growth of biofilm-forming marine bacteria with EC50 values < 10 mu M, and five bile acids (1, 5, and 7-9) potently inhibited the growth of diatoms, showing EC50, values between 3 and 10 mu M. Promising AF profiles were achieved with some of the synthesized bile acids by combining antimacrofouling and antimicrofouling activities. Initial studies on the incorporation of one of these promising bile acid derivatives in polymeric coatings, such as a marine paint, demonstrated the ability of these compounds to generate coatings with antimacrofouling activity.

AB In order to provide a viable option for remediation of PAHs-contaminated soils, a greenhouse experiment was conducted to assess the effect of corn straw amendment (1%, 2%, 4% or 6%, w/w) on dissipation of aged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in contaminated soils. Backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) was applied to model the relationships between soil properties and PAHs concentration in soils. The removal rate of PAHs, enzyme activity (catalase and dehydrogenase), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) in soils were investigated to evaluate the dissipation of PAHs under different ratio of corn straw amendment. The present study showed that corn straw amendment apparently accelerated the dissipation of PAHs after incubation of 112 days, especially under 4% and 6% treatments. Compared with non-amended soil, corn straw amendment significantly (p < 0.05) increased the removal rate of low molecular weight (LMW) PAHs and significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced the dissipation of high molecular weight (HMW) PAHs only under 6% treatment. Moreover, corn straw amendment increased activities of catalase and dehydrogenase, concentrations of DOC and MBC in soils, which are beneficial to the degradation of PAHs in soils. The performance of the BP-ANN model was assessed through the root mean square error (RMSE) and determination coefficient (R-2). The results indicated that BP-ANN model could provide satisfactory prediction of PAHs concentration in soils during incubation period at R-2 and RMSE values of 0.948, 187.4 mu g kg(-1), respectively. The results indicated that high amendment of corn straw was a potential option for remediation of PAHs-contaminated soils and that the BP-ANN model could successfully provide prompt prediction of PAHs concentration in soils.

AB Surface-active ionic liquids (SAILs) belonging to the series of N-alkylmethylimidazolium halides [C(8)mimX] (X = Br, CI, and BF4) and [C(n)mimBr] (n = 10, 12, 14, and 16) were employed to understand the influence of hydrophobicity of alkyl chain length and the chaotropicity of counter-ions of SAILs on the micellization, antimicrobial action and cytotoxicity properties. The micellization phenomenon of SAILs in an aqueous environment was examined employing tensiometry and steady-state fluorescence spectrophotometry. The corresponding interfacial parameters viz., critical micelle concentration (CMC), effectiveness (gamma(CMC)), surface pressure (Pi(CMC)), maximum surface excess concentration (Gamma(max) and the minimum area engaged per molecule (A(min)) at the air- water interface were evaluated at 303.15 K. These experimental findings were monitored and geometrically optimized theoretically using Gaussian software to highlight the recent advances in this field of theoretical calculations for putative structure. The simulation descriptors correlated the micellization behavior as a function of hydrophobicity which may contribute to obtaining awareness on their ecological behavior and fate. In addition, the biological screening of all the examined SAILs was undertaken with a combined experimental and theoretical (optimized) method against bacteria and fungus. Results revealed that SAILs with the alkyl chain-length greater than C-8- act as a fair antimicrobial agent against the selected microbial strain which is attributed to the enhanced degree of SAILs hydrophobicity. The cytotoxicity of these imidazolium-based SAILs was also assessed on the cervical human cell line (HeLa) using the MTT cell viability assay and the data thus obtained were subjected to statistical analysis.

AB Cadmium, a typical heavy metal, causes serious toxicities on many organs and tissues. As the last partially controlled class of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), BDE209 can also induce various health issues. Although apoptosis mediated by mitochondria has been known to be a key player in inducing toxicities by cadmium, the detailed mechanisms are incompletely understood. Moreover, co-existence of cadmium and PBDEs has been found in various environment context and human body. However, studies on the joint toxicity of cadmium and PBDEs are still limited with largely unknown mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated the adverse effects and mechanisms of single or combined treatment of CdCl2 and BDE209 on hepatocytes. We observed that apoptosis were significantly induced by CdCl2, and the combined treatment of CdCl2 and BDE209 greatly promoted the progression of apoptosis. BDE209 induced mild apoptosis. Mitochondria was the pivot of several mechanisms to induce apoptosis, including ROS production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mtDNA damage and disordered calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. However, we found that mtDNA damage and disordered Ca2+ homeostasis were the main mechanisms for CdCl2-induced apoptosis while ROS production played important roles in BDE209-induced apoptosis. Less mtDNA damage occurred in BDE209-treated cells. In the cells with combined treatment, CdCl2 and BDE209 exhibited a complementary pattern for the underlying mechanisms of apoptosis, leading to the joint toxicities, in which CdCl2 showed more contributions. In a conclusion, our results demonstrated that combined exposure to cadmium and BDE209 causes joint adverse effects on hepatocytes through diverse mechanisms as mediated by mitochondria.

AB In this study, heavy metals including Cd, Pb, Zn, Mn, Cu, Ni, Cr, As, and Hg, in the surface sediment (0-10 cm) of the Huixian wetland in a karst region were investigated in terms of their spatial distribution, ecological risks, and possible sources. Samples were collected from 13 typical sites throughout the Huixian wetland and were analyzed via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The results revealed that the mean concentrations of Cd, Pb, Mn, Cr, As, and Hg were higher than the background and Chinese safe standard values. Based on spatial distribution and ecological risk, the study area was differentiated into three groups of sites with the following order of risk: group 3 > group 2 > group 1. The observed concentrations fluctuated slightly with depth. However, an irregular decreasing trend in the concentration with soil depth was observed among the groups. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that the high accumulation of Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu in the sediments of group 3 sites is due to the natural ancient deposition of minerals rich in heavy metals, while the accumulation of Mn, Cr, As, and Hg is attributed to an anthropogenic origin. Agricultural activities, the use of fertilizers and, pesticides, and local automobile repair stations most probably enriched these heavy metals in the Huixian wetland sediments. Hg and Cd have the highest potential ecological risk, which follows the order Hg > Cd > Pb > As > Ni > Cu > Cr > Mn > Zn. The mean geoaccumulation index (I-geo) values of Pb (0.48) and Hg (1.12) suggested moderate contamination in the study area.

AB Magnesium (Mg) is a common contaminant in mine water discharges. Although Mg is an essential element in biological processes, increased concentrations from anthropogenic sources can stress aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, studies evaluating the effects of Mg on north Australian freshwater species have indicated that in very soft waters there is a high risk to some species. Freshwater mussels are an ecologically and culturally important taxon in many freshwater environments, but knowledge of their sensitivity to Mg is limited. In the present study, the acute and chronic sensitivity of two freshwater mussel species, Velesunio angasi and an undescribed Velesunio species, to Mg was assessed (using MgSO4) on their early life stages, larval glochidia and post-parasitic juveniles. Acute 24-h exposures with glochidia generated a mean median lethal (LC50) toxicity estimate of 284mg/L for the five tests with V. angasi, and a mean LC50 of 300mg/L for the three tests with Velesunio sp. Mean chronic 14-d toxicity estimates resulting in 50% (EC50) and 10% (EC10) growth rate reductions for juveniles were 241 and 88mg/L respectively for the three tests with V. angasi juveniles, and 232 and 87mg/L respectively for the three tests with Velesunio sp. juveniles.
   The results represent the first acute and chronic Mg toxicity data for tropical freshwater mussels, and indicated that V. angasi and Velesunio sp. exhibited similar sensitivity and were moderately sensitive to Mg when compared to other tropical species These results are a valuable contribution to the small existing dataset for Mg toxicity to tropical freshwater species, which can be used to inform water management in areas where Mg is a contaminant of concern, and ensure the protection of these taxa.

AB Imidazolium-based ionic liquids (IL) with short-alkyl side chain such as 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium chloride ([Emim]Cl) and 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium chloride ([Bmim]Cl) has immense application potential including in lignocellulosic bioenergy production. But they are toxic to most microorganisms, and those isolated from different environments as IL-tolerant have salt tolerance capabilities. This study evaluates the relationship between salt and [Emim]Cl tolerance of microorganisms using different salinity sediments (2-19%) and brines (35%) of India's largest inland hypersaline lake, Sambhar in Rajasthan as the model system. While samples with 2% and 35% salinities do not yield any [Emitn]Cl (100 mM) tolerant colonies, others have 6-50% colonies tolerant to the IL. Similar trend was observed with 50 mM [Bmim]Cl. Moderate halophilic isolates of genera Halomonas and Bacillus (growth in 0.7-3.0 M NaCl) isolated from the sediments could grow in as high as 375 mM [Emim]Cl, or 125 mM [Bmim]Cl facilitated by higher synthesis, and uptake of organic osmolytes; and up to 1.7-fold increased activity of active efflux pumps. [Bmim]Cl was more toxic than [Emim]Cl in all performed experiments. [Emim]Cl-adapted cells could trounce IL-induced stress. Interestingly, enrichment with 100 mM [Emim]Cl resulted in increase of IL-tolerant colonies in all sediments including the one with 2% salinity. However, the salt saturated brines (35%) do not yield any such colony even after repeated incubations. Extreme halophilic archaea, Natronomonas (growth in 3.0-4.0 M NaCl) isolated from such brines, were exceedingly sensitive to even 5 mM [Emim]Cl, or 1 mM [Bmirn]Cl. Two additional extremophilic archaea, namely Haloferax and Haladaptatus were also sensitive to the tested ILs. Archaeal sensitivity is possibly due to the competitive interaction of [Emim](+) with their acidic proteome (15.4-17.5% aspartic and glutamic acids, against 10.7-12.9% in bacteria) that they maintain to stabilize the high amount of K+ ion accumulated by salt-in strategy. Thus, general salt adaptation strategies of moderate halophilic bacteria help them to restrain toxicity of these ILs, but extremophilic archaea are highly sensitive and demands meticulous use of these solvents to prevent environmental contamination.

AB Mercury (Hg) is one of the most toxic heavy metals with strong negative effects on the plant growth and functions. Salicylic acid (SA) is an important signaling molecule which confers tolerance to metal toxicities but little is known about the mechanisms of SA-mediated alleviation of Hg stress. Here, physiochemical and molecular responses of Hg-stressed lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.) to exogenous SA were investigated to reveal SA-induced tolerance mechanisms. The CHLG gene of lemon balm which encodes chlorophyll synthase was also partly isolated and sequenced for the first time. Hg stress markedly decreased growth, relative water content (RWC) and photosynthetic pigments of the plant. However, exogenous SA significantly mitigated the toxic effects of mercury on the growth and RWC and enabled plant to maintain chlorophylls to the similar levels of unstressed plants. Hg-induced oxidative damage was also reduced following treatment with SA and treated plants showed the lower extent of lipid peroxidation which was accompanied with the higher free proline and phenolics contents and elevation of the antioxidant capacity as evidenced by DPPH radical scavenging and FRAP assays. Moreover, SA treatment resulted in up-regulation of CHLG and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) genes as key components of chlorophyll and phenylpropanoid routes, respectively. Our results collectively indicate the ameliorative effects of exogenous SA in mercury toxicity through coordinated alternations in plant metabolic processes which provide insights to better understand mechanisms of Hg tolerance in lemon balm plant.

AB Vegetation cover can be used in the phytomanagement of polluted areas by adding value to abandoned sites and reducing the dispersion of pollutants by erosion. Appropriate amendments, that allow both efficient plant growth and the immobilization of contaminants in the soil must be chosen in order to optimize the efficiency of this process. We used a mining technosol mainly contaminated by arsenic (1068 mg kg(-1)) and lead (23387 mg kg(-1)) to study the effect of three amendments (biochar, compost and iron grit) on (i) physico-chemical properties of the soil and soil pore water, (ii) metal(loid) mobility, bioavailability and bioaccessibility (CaCl2 and Simple Bioaccessibility Extraction Test (SBET)), and (iii) the capability of Trifolium repens to germinate and grow. All the amendments used increased the pH and electrical conductivity of the SPW, resulting in a 90% decrease in the concentration of lead in the soil pore water (SPW). We also demonstrated a decrease in Pb phytoavailability. The amendments allowed the establishment of a plant cover, although the addition of iron grit alone did not allow any clover germination. For the Pontgibaud technosol, the combination of the three amendments resulted in a significant decrease in As and Pb concentrations in clover tissues, mainly in the aerial organs. The amendments also made it possible for some of them to halve the phytoavailable fraction of arsenic. However, for compost, both the As concentrations in the SPW, and the bioavailable fraction of As increased. All the amendments used had contrasting effects on the bioaccessible fractions of metal(loid)s. The most efficient amendment combination was the addition of 5% biochar and 5% compost.

AB The widespread application of nanomaterial-based products has caused safety concerns worldwide, especially for susceptible pregnant population. Here, we revealed the effect of the size of ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) on placental and fetal developmental toxicities. We found that smaller ZnO NPs (13 nm) were able to cross both the intestinal barrier and the placental barrier to reach the fetus after oral exposure and caused fetal developmental toxicity. However, larger ZnO NPs (57 nm) and bulk ZnO particles were not able to cross these barriers and exert effects. We also discovered that the organogenesis period (GD7-GD16) was more vulnerable to such toxicity compared with the peri-implantation period (GD1-GD10) of pregnancy. This new understanding that smaller nanoparticles may pass through multiple biological barriers to induce toxicity in susceptible populations is crucial for the safeguarding of humans from the widespread application of nanoproducts. The discovery that the organogenesis stage in pregnancy is more vulnerable to nanotoxicity than the pen-implantation stage is provides valuable guidance for an improved protection strategy.

AB The increasing human presence in the Arctic shelf seas, with the expansion of oil and gas industries and maritime shipping, poses a risk for Arctic marine organisms such as the key species polar cod (Boreogadus saida). The impact of dietary crude oil on growth and metabolism of polar cod was investigated in the early spring (March April) when individuals are expected to be in a vulnerable physiological state with poor energy stores. Adult polar cod were exposed dietarily to three doses of Kobbe crude oil during an eight weeks period and followed by two weeks of depuration. Significant dose-responses in exposure biomarkers (hepatic ethoxyresorufine-O-deethylase [EROD] activity and 1-OH phenanthrene metabolites in bile) indicated that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were bioavailable. Condition indices (i.e. Fulton's condition factor, hepatosomatic index), growth, whole body respiration, and total lipid content in the liver were monitored over the course of the experiment. The majority of females were immature, while a few had spawned during the season and showed low hepatic lipid content during the experiment. In contrast, males were all, except for one immature individual, in a post-spawning stage and had larger hepatic energy stores than females. Most specimens, independent of sex, showed a loss in weight, that was exacerbated by exposure to crude oil and low hepatic liver lipids. Furthermore, females exposed to crude oil showed a significant elevation of oxygen consumption compared to controls, although not dose-dependent. This study highlights the importance of the energy status of individuals for their response to a crude oil exposure.

AB The study aimed at comparing metabolic reactions of a halophyte Aster tripolium to abiotic stresses. Profiling of endogenous phytohormones, soluble carbohydrates and stress-related amino acids was conducted in plants exposed to moderate and high salinity (150 and 300 mM NaCl), and heavy metal salts CdCl2 or PbCl2 (100 and 200 pM).
   High NaCl and Pb doses inhibited growth of A. tripolium (Stress Tolerance Index STI) of 37% and 32-35%, respectively. The plants tolerated moderate salinity and Cd (STI = 91% and STI = 83-96%, respectively). Toxic metals accumulated mainly in the roots but Cd translocation to the shoots was also observed. The stressors did not affect total concentrations of the main growth promoting phytohormones but we observed enhanced deactivation of auxins and gibberellins, and reduced accumulation of jasmonate precursor. ABA content increased under stress except for moderate salinity. A common reaction was also activation of osmotic adjustment, however it was disparately manifested under salinity and metallic stress. The distinct responses to salinity and metallic stresses involved changes in carbohydrate profile and altered interplay between salicylic acid content and the pool of active gibberellins. The content of active jasmonates diversified A. tripolium reactions to salt excess and each of the heavy metals. This parameter was linked to the accumulation of ethylene precursor. The results of the study can be used to decipher potential co-tolerance mechanism of this halophyte species to multiple environmental stresses.

AB The objective of this work was to investigate the effects of salinized water on Lippia gracilis by determining the ion accumulation capacity and morphophysiological changes as a function of salinity and time of exposure to stress. L. gracilis was irrigated with water containing different concentrations of salts and electrical conductivities. The analyses were conducted 25 and 50 days after stress (DAS), in leaf, stem/branches, and roots. Plant height (Hplants), basal stem diameter (lstem), and mean unitary leaf area (ULA) were determined. After that, the plant material was dried, and the total dry biomass (TDB) (in g plant(-1)), leaf dry biomass (LDB), stem dry biomass (SDB), and the roots dry biomass (RDB) were determined. Based on these data, the following variables were calculated: total leaf area (TLA) in cm(2) plant(-1); biomass allocation fraction (BAF) obtained by dividing the biomass of the stem, leaves, and roots, separately, with the total plant biomass; relative growth rate (RGR); net assimilation rate (NAR); leaf area ratio (LAR); specific leaf area (SLA); and sclerophylly index (SI). The concentrations of potassium and sodium ions were quantified by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and the chloride ion concentration was determined by argentometric titration. L. gracilis showed a variable response to salt stress as a function of time, having a considerable capacity to withstand an increasing load of toxic ions, while maintaining a positive growth rate, highlighting the potential use of the species in moderately saline environments.

AB Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and organophosphate pesticides (OPPs) posed severe threats to the aquatic environment in China. The toxicity data of 18 priority OCPs and OPPs for Chinese and American species were collected, and their species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) and ecotoxicity were compared. Physicochemical characteristics and chemical structures were used to analyze the difference in the pesticide toxicity. Results suggested that there is no significant difference between the HC5 values (hazardous concentration protecting 95% of species) of China and America as a whole. However, the HC5 values of nearly half of these pesticides (8/18) differ dramatically between Chinese and American due to the different resident species distribution. It indicated that it is necessary to develop local water quality criteria in China. The regression analysis of pesticides toxicity differences indicated a decrease in LC50/EC50 values (for Oncorhynchus mykiss and Carassius auratu) with the increase in molecular weights of pesticides. Pesticides with larger MWs might be more toxic to aquatic species. Similar trend was also observed in the regression analysis of a decrease in both American and Chinese HC5 values for with increase of the number of containing halogen atoms. It indicated the potency of these parameters to be used to predict the ecotoxicity of pesticide.

AB Chlorantraniliprole (CAP) can induce excessive calcium release from muscle of insects, causing muscle paralysis until death, and its residues in farmland can cause poisoning in Bombyx mori (B. mori), resulting in the failure of cocooning. No reports have investigated the effects of CAP exposure on detoxification enzyme activities and detoxification-related gene expression in B. mori. In the present study, we treated mulberry leaves with CAP by the leaf-dipping method, and then B. mori larvae were continuously fed with the polluted mulberry leaves. Moreover, the detoxification enzyme activities and the expressions of detoxification-related genes in the fat body of B. mori were examined. The results showed that at 24 h after CAP exposure, the activities of P450 and GST enzymes were all significantly increased, with P450 enzymes responding fastest. CarE enzyme activity was up regulated in 24 h, and then it was decreased compared with the control group. Furthermore, the expressions of the key genes in the PI3K/Akt/CncC signaling pathway (PI3K, PDK, Akt, CncC and Keap1) at the mRNA were significantly increased. Western blotting analysis revealed that Akt was inhibited at the protein level, resulting in decreased expression of Keap1 and increased expression of CncC. These results indicated that the PI3K/Akt/CncC signaling pathway in the fat body of B. mori responded to CAP exposure and regulated the expressions of downstream detoxification enzymes, thus enhancing the detoxifying capability of B. mari.

AB Cadmium (Cd) is a known human carcinogen. Previous studies have demonstrated that Cd exposure promoted migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process have not yet been clearly addressed. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether TG-interacting factor (TGIF) was involved in long-term Cd exposure-induced migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Human breast cancer cells were continuously exposed to Cd for eight weeks. Western blot and qRT-PCR assays were performed to measure the expression of protein and mRNA. Migration and invasion assays were performed to assess the migratory and invasive ability of human breast cancer cells. Our data indicated that long-term Cd exposure obviously increased the expression of TGIF protein and mRNA in human breast cancer cells. Long-term Cd exposure increased the ability of migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells, which could be inhibited by transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting TGIF. We also observed that the long-term Cd exposure-induced up-regulation of MMP2 mRNA expression was modulated by TGIF. In conclusion, our findings suggested that TGIF/MMP2 signaling axis might be involved in malignant progression stimulated by long-term Cd exposure in human breast cancer.

AB Surface sediments, sampled from Iranian coast of the Persian Gulf (n = 134), were analyzed in order to track spatial distribution of PAHs and their related eco-hazards. The levels of PAHs were in the range of 1.98-814 ng g(-1) dw and the region was lowly to moderately polluted. The profile of PAHs was mainly composed of 2,3-ring chemicals and suggested a local source of PAHs and relatively fresh inputs. Statistical analysis and molecular fingerprints proposed that the basin receives PAHs from multiple origins including petrogenic and pyrogenic (traffic and auto emission) ones. Spatial distribution of organic matter and fine fraction of the sediments had a horizontally increasing trend in the studied basin. Sigma(16)PAHs showed significant positive correlation with TOC and fine fraction (p < 0.05) and the spatial deposition of Sigma(16)PAHs followed the spatial trends of TOC and fine fraction. Spatial mapping techniques confirmed that Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ) is the hot zone of PAH pollution. A combination of source availability, finer sediments, and great organic matter levels were the main effective factors that highlighted the deposition of PAHs in the PSEEZ. The Nayband Bay, as the Iran's first national marine Park, possibly received PAHs from its adjacent zone, the PSEEZ. On the other hand, low organic matter and sandy nature of the Nayband Bay was not suitable for effective sequestration of PAHs. Thus, the biota of Nayband Park was encountering with relatively severe multiple eco-hazards due to both ecological and economic factors.

AB To better evaluate chemical damage in chronically contaminated habitats, a nine-generational exposure to Lead (Pb) was done with two monophyletic Daphnia species, from temperate (Daphnia magna) and tropical (Daphnia similis) environments. The multi-generational test consisted generally of a continuous Pb exposed set of organisms, plus an extra control set running simultaneously. To assess daphnids recovery after Pb exposure, some organisms from the sixth generation were transferred to clean media for three extra generations (recovery period; F6 to F9), while others were keep Pb exposed. All setups (control, Pb exposure and recovery period) were submitted to two different dietary regimes, the standard (3 x 10(5) cells/mL) and restricted food (1.5 x 10(5) cells/mL) regimes. To evaluate the effects of generational Pb exposure and food regimes, individual, functional and population related endpoints were assessed (number of offspring, body length and rate of population increase (r) and feeding rate (FR)). The tests were conducted on the first (F0) and last generations (F9). No differences were shown on number of offspring and feeding among F9 control and continuous Pb exposed D. magna, although a higher r was shown for F9 Pb exposed organisms. F9 Pb exposed D. similis also presented a higher r than F9 control, however, lethality was induced at high Pb exposure levels. At food restriction the patterns were opposite and D. magna died at high Pb exposure while Pb exposed D. similis was the only setup (compared to control and recovery period) to survive at high Pb exposure levels. Regarding the recovery period, D. magna (standard food) did not cope well with the Pb re-exposure and lethality was induced, while D. similis indicate a decreased Pb sensitivity (only setup that survived high Pb exposure levels). Under food restriction, both species presented a decreased Pb sensitivity and consequent failed recovery (possibly due to epigenetic changes). Both species presented similar patterns regarding generations. Organisms from F0 presented enhanced reproductive outputs in comparison to F9 and the contrary occurred to the FR (even in control organisms). Data show an acclimation under a generational Pb exposure, which could increase the population of adapted organisms in natural habitats. And, since there was not a full recovery after three generations in clean media, an indication of epigenetic changes for both species may also be considered.

However, it is still an urgent need to develop new tools to assess the agrochemical aquatic toxicity efficiently and accurately. In this work, QSTR studies were performed on a data set containing 639 diverse pesticides with measured EC50 toxicity against Daphnia magna, by using five machine learning methods combined with seven fingerprints and a set of molecular descriptors. The imbalance problem of the data set was successfully solved by clustering analysis. The top-10 QSTR models displayed greater predicative abilities than ECOSAR. The optimal model, Ext-SVM, showed the best performance in 10-fold cross validation (Q(high) = 0.807, Q(moderate) = 0.806, Q(low) = 0.755, Q(total) = 0.794), and also in the test set verification (Q(high) = 0.865, Q(moderate) = 0.783, Q(low) = 0.931, Q(total) = 0.848). The relevance of the key physical-chemical properties with the toxicity was also investigated, in which the MW, a_np, logP(o/w), GCUT_SLOGP_1, chilv and SMR_VSA7 values displayed positive correlation with Daphnia magna toxicity, whereas the logS and a_don showed negative correlation. The robust QSTR models provided efficient tools for assessing agrochemical aquatic toxicity, and the revealed different physical-chemical properties between the high and low toxic compounds might be useful in the discovery and design of low aquatic toxic pesticides.

AB Large areas polluted with toxic heavy metals or radionuclides were formed as a side product of rapid industrial development of human society. Plants, due to their sessile nature, should adapt to these challenging genotoxic environmental conditions and develop resistance. Herein, we evaluated the response of three natural ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh (Oasis, Columbia-0, and Chernobyl-07) to cadmium, using discovery gel-based proteomics. These accessions are differing by level of tolerance to heavy metal probably achieved by various exposure to chronic ionizing radiation. Based on the pairwise comparison (control versus cadmium-treated) we recognized 5.8-13.4% of identified proteins as significantly altered at the presence of cadmium. Although the majority of photosynthesis-related proteins were found to be less abundant in all ecotypes it was noted that in contrast to the sensitive variants (Col and Oas), the tolerant Che accession may activate the mechanism preserving photosynthesis and energy production. Also, proteins modulating energy budget through alternative route and mediating higher resistance to heavy metals were upregulated in this ecotype. Although we suggest that regulation of enzymes acting in peptide and protein synthesis, protection of the plants against various abiotic stresses, or those neutralizing the effects of reactive oxygen species are rather associated with general response to cadmium, they were found to be altered more intensively in the Che accession. Thus, the identified affected proteins may represent good candidate molecules for molecular breeding to improve tolerance of crops to heavy metal stress.

AB Gemfibrozil, a lipid-regulating pharmaceutical, has been widely used for treating dyslipidemia in humans and detected frequently in freshwater environments. Since plasma cholesterol is a precursor of steroid hormones, the use of gemfibrozil may influence the sex hormone balances. However, its endocrine toxicity following long-term exposure is not well understood. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of gemfibrozil on sex hormones and reproductive outcomes in a freshwater fish, following a long-term (155 d) exposure. For this purpose, Japanese medaka embryos (F0) were exposed to a series of gemfibrozil concentrations, i.e., 0, 0.04, 0.4, 3.7, and 40 mg/L for 155 d, and reproductive parameters, sex hormones, and associated gene expressions were assessed. For comparison, a short-term exposure (21 d) was performed separately with adult medaka and measured for sex hormones and related gene expressions. Following the 155 d long-term exposure, the fecundity showed a decreasing pattern. In addition, at 3.7 mg/L gemfibrozil, testosterone (T) level in the female fish was significantly decreased, and the hatchability of F1 fish was significantly decreased. The estrogen receptor (er) or vitellogenin (vtg) genes in gonads and liver were up-regulated. However, plasma cholesterol levels did not show significant changes in both sexes. The observations from the short-term (21 d) exposure were different from those of the long-term exposure. Following the short-term exposure, decreased 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) levels along with decrease plasma cholesterol were observed in the male fish. The hormone disruption following the short-term exposure appears to be associated with the hypocholesterolemic activity of gemfibrozil. Our results show that the mechanisms of gemfibrozil toxicity may depend on the exposure duration. Consequences of long-term exposure to other fibrates in the water environment warrant further investigations.

AB Free-ranging animals are often used as bioindicators of both short- and long-term changes in ecosystem health, mainly to detect the presence and effects of contaminants. Birds, and gulls in particular, have been used as bioindicators over a broad range of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, we standardise the conditions for the use of a suite of biochemical markers in non-destructive matrices of Lesser Black-backed Gull (Larus fuscus) to facilitate future biomonitoring of marine and terrestrial contaminants. We characterized cholinesterase (ChE) in plasma and optimized assay conditions for ChE activity as a marker of neurotoxic damage. Moreover, we quantified variation in activity of ChE, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT) as well as variation ranges of lipid peroxidation (LPO), in free-ranging adults and captive chicks. The main ChE form present in plasma of both adults and chicks was butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) followed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), whose relative proportion in plasma tended to decrease with increased chick age. LPO levels and GST activity in blood cells (BCs) decreased significantly with increasing chick age, while BChE and LDH activity in plasma were not age-dependent. CAT in BCs tended to decline non-significantly in older chicks. Results of this study underscore the importance of standardising assay conditions and assessing intrinsic baseline variation in biochemical markers, before biochemical quantification. Data presented here provide a foundation for future use of BChE and LDH activity in plasma, as well as oxidative stress markers (LPO, CAT and GST) in BCs, to monitor environmental stress effects in Lesser Black-backed gulls.

AB Bioactive substances in the Biobio River Basin in Chile were examined by deploying Semi Permeable Membrane Devices (SPMDs) upstream and downstream of 4 pulp mill effluent discharges. Androgenic and estrogenic activity of SPMD extracts were then evaluated using in vitro fish sex steroid receptor binding assays. The results indicated the occurrence of estrogenic type compounds associated with one of the mill discharges. A significant correlation among the presence of these compounds, an increase in gonadosomatic index GSI and induction of hepatic EROD activity of two native fish species was observed. However, no significant presence of mature oocytes in female gonads was detected. Although EROD induction was observed in sites impacted by mill effluents, an increase of its activity occurred towards the downstream areas, suggesting other non-mill sources. More research is needed to understand the environmental changes in context of the new technological improvements in treatment systems to MBBR (Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor) recently implemented by the pulp mill industries.

AB Ambient particulate matter (PM) poses a great threat to global health and contributes to pulmonary inflammation. However, the potential mechanism of PM-induced inflammation of the lung remains unclear. Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional protein that reportedly regulates inflammatory responses in different diseases. Here, we explored the expression of OPN with PM exposure in vivo and in vitro and attempted to elucidate the regulatory role of OPN in PM-induced airway inflammation. Our results showed that PM exposure increased the expression of OPN in the bronchial epithelium, serum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of mice. Moreover, PM induced OPN expression in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in a dose and time-dependent manner. In vitro, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta were increased in HBECs with PM exposure via the ERK and JNK signaling pathways. Recombinant human OPN could potentiate PM-induced expression of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, while OPN siRNA could alleviate PM-induced inflammatory responses in HBECs. Furthermore, we showed that OPN regulated PM-induced inflammatory cytokines via the ERK and JNK pathways in HBECs. This study shows for the first time the positive effect of OPN on PM-induced airway inflammation and contributes to a better understanding of its potential mechanism of action.

AB Background: Heavy metal contamination is becoming a limitation to the utilization of soil and the distribution of vegetation. In particular, cadmium (Cd) pollution has had a serious impact on the food chain. Broussonetia papyrifera is a widely distributed pioneer tree species of heavy metal contaminated areas with important economic value. However, little is known about the genomic background of the Cd-tolerance mechanism in B. papyrifera.
   Results: The CdCl2 responsive physiology was evaluated and proved to be involved in antioxidase activity and active oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. The leaf and root transcriptomes derived from B. papyrifera grown under normal and CdCl2 stress conditions were systematically investigated using the Illumina HiSeq method. A total of 180,678,660 bp (27.1 GB) clean reads were assembled into 589,487 high-quality unigenes, of which 256,025 (43.43% of the total) and 250,251 (42.45% of the total) were aligned in Gene Ontology (GO) and Protein family (Pfam), respectively. A total of 24,414 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were GO-annotated into 53, 23, 55, and 60 terms from the transcriptomes of root and leaf tissues under Cd stress and control conditions. A total of 117,547 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology (KO)-annotated DEGs were enriched in at least 47 KEGG pathway terms among the four comparisons. Many genes encoding important transcription factors (e.g., auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (AUX/IAA), basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), DNA-binding one zinc finger (Dof), and MYB) and proteins involved in plant-pathogen interactions, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, oxidative phosphorylation, carbon fixation, peroxisomes, flavonoid biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism, among others, were substantially upregulated under CdCl2 stress.
   Conclusions: These genes represent important candidates for studying Cd-response mechanisms and molecular biology of B. papyrifera and related species. Our findings provide a genomic sequence resource for functional genetic assignments in B. papyrifera, which will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of its Cd-stress responses and facilitate the bioremediation of heavy metal contaminated areas via breeding of new stress-tolerant cultivars.

AB To evaluate the scavenging effect of functionalized biochar against the phytotoxicity of Pb2+, original biochar (O-B) was chemically oxidized with either HNO3 or KMnO4 to serve as biofilters (O-BF, HNO3-BF and ICMnO4-BF) to hydroponically grown chicory (Cichorium intybus L. var. intybus). Plants subjected to Pb-stress showed various deteriorations in cell organelles including visible alterations in chloroplasts, malformations in plant cells, abnormalities in the mitochondrial system, inward invagination of cell walls, distortions in the plasma membrane, oversized vacuoles and irregular increase in plastoglobuli formation. In addition, disorganization in xylem and phloem tissues and numerous variations in the stomatal number, density and dimensions as well as stomata movement were noticeable in the abaxial leaf surface. Pb-stressed plants showed increments in root diameter, vascular cylinder and metaxylem vessels as well as an obvious increase in the thickness of cortex, intercellular aerenchyma and endodermis layer. Furthermore, a noticeable disturbance in macro-and micronutrient concentrations was recorded in Pb-stressed plants due to the defect in their water status. O-BF showed a limited scavenging effect against the phytotoxicity of Pb2+. However, oxidized biochar filters (particularly KMnO4-BF) recorded a noticeable safeguard effect due to their high affinity to Pb2+ ions. The higher sorption capacity of KMnO4-BF reduced the concentration of Pb in leaf tissues compared to the unequipped filtration treatment (117 vs. 19 mu g g(-1)). In conclusion, data of this hydroponic study provides baseline information regarding the detoxification mechanisms of functionalized biochar against the phytotoxicity of trace elements.

AB Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for humans and animals. In China, intensive agricultural inputs in greenhouse vegetable production (GVP) have resulted in great changes in Se concentration and bioavailability in soil, which have great influences on Se flux to living organisms through food chains. It is crucial to understand the factors on Se concentration and bioavailability in greenhouse soil. Thus, we chose the east bank of the Dianchi Lake, a typical GVP area covering 177 km(2) in Southwest China, as the study area to quantify source contributions to soil Se and estimate relative importance of influence factors on its bioavailability in GVP with a receptor model (absolute principal component scores-multiple linear regression, APCS-MLR) after principal component analysis (PCA). According to the enrichment factor (EF), total Se in greenhouse soil was accumulated at a minor level (1 < EF < 3) by long-term and intensive fertilization. Source contributions to total Se decreased in the sequence of parent materials > fertilization > atmospheric deposition. It suggested that fertilization, especially manure, might be an important way to increase total Se in greenhouse soils in Se-deficient areas. The bioavailability of Se was affected by several factors, among of which total Se was the foremost one. In comparison with organic matter and clay, Fe/Al oxides exerted more controls on Se bioavailability, which was dependent on pH. Increasing Olsen P was helpful in improving soil Se bioavailability in greenhouse. More attention should be paid to soil physicochemical characteristics when Se-containing fertilizers are applied to increase Se levels in greenhouse vegetables.

AB This study provided an assessment of the environmental fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in a Scottish grassland field repeatedly treated with different organic fertilizers. The impacts of manure, biosolids and municipal food-derived compost on the relative abundances of tetracycline ARGs (tetA, tetB, tetC, tetG and tetW), sulfonamide ARGs (sul1 and sul2) and class 1 integron-integrase gene (IntI1) in soils were investigated, with inorganic fertilizer (NPK) as a comparison. The background soil with a history of low intensity farming showed a higher total relative abundance of tet ARGs over sul ARGs, with tetracycline efflux genes occurring in a higher frequency. In all treatments, the relative abundances of most ARGs detected in soils decreased over time, especially IntI1 and tet ARGs. This general attenuation of soil ARGs is a reflection of changes in the soil microbial community, which is supported by the result that almost all the soils at the end of the experiment had different bacterial communities from the untreated soil at the beginning of the experiment. Multiple applications of organic fertilizers to some extent counteracted the decreasing trend of soil ARGs relative abundances, which resulted in higher ARGs relative abundances in comparison to NPK, either by a lesser decrease of IntI1 and tet ARGs or an increase of sul ARGs. The enhancement of existing soil ARG prevalence by organic fertilizers was strongly dependent on the organic fertilizer type and the particular ARG. Compost contained the lowest relative abundance of inherent ARGs and had the least effect on the soil ARG decrease after application. The relative increase of tet ARGs caused by biosolids was larger than that of sul ARGs, while manure caused the opposite effect. Fertilization practices did not exert effective impacts on the soil bacterial community, although it caused significant changes in the profile of the ARG pool. Organic fertilization may thus accelerate the dissemination of ARGs in soil mainly through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), consistent with the enrichment of IntI1 in organic fertilized soils.

AB It is important to assess indoor air quality in school classrooms where the air quality may significantly influence school children's health and performance. This study aims to determine the concentrations of PM2.5 and dust chemical compositions in indoor and outdoor school classroom located in Kuala Lumpur City Centre. The PM2.5 concentration was measured from 19th September 2017-16th February 2018 using an optical PM2.5 sensor. Indoor and outdoor dust was also collected from the school classrooms and ion and trace metal concentrations were analysed using ion chromatography (IC) and inductively couple plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) respectively. This study showed that the average indoor and outdoor 24 h PM2.5 was 11.2 +/- 0.45 mu g m(-3) and 11.4 +/- 0.44 mu g m(-3) respectively. The 8 h PM2.5 concentration ranged between 3.2 and 28 mu g m(-3) for indoor and 3.2 and 19 mu g m(-3) for outdoor classrooms. The highest ion concentration in indoor dust was Ca2+ with an average concentration of 38.5 +/- 35.0 mu g g(-1) while for outdoor dust SO42- recorded the highest ion concentration with an average concentration of 30.6 +/- 9.37 mu g g(-1). Dominant trace metals in both indoor and outdoor dust were Al, Fe and Zn. Principle component analysis-multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) demonstrated that the major source of indoor dust was road dust (69%), while soil dominated the outdoor dust (74%). Health risk assessment showed that the hazard quotient (HQ) value for non-carcinogenic trace metals was < 1 while the total cancer risk (CR) value for carcinogenic elements was below the acceptable limit for both indoor and outdoor dust through dermal and inhalation pathways, but not the ingestion pathway. This study suggests indoor contributions of PM2.5 concentrations are due to the activities of the school children while the compositions of indoor and outdoor dust are greatly influenced by the soil/earth source plus industrial and traffic contribution.

AB The residues of pharmaceutical and personal care products are the cause of increasing concern around the world. The aim of this study was to carry out the quantification of six antipsychotic drugs in hospital wastewater with the aid of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and, subsequently, make a preliminary assessment of the environmental risk posed. Dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction and solid phase extraction were optimized by multivariate design and validated in compliance with international guidelines. The extraction procedures were successfully applied to the quantification of the six selected antipsychotics in samples that were formed each day and collected at two main sampling points of the sewage network over the period of a week, in December 2017. Olanzapine (0.31-0.52 mu g L-1), clozapine (0.56-0.97 mu g L-1), haloperidol (1.43-2.73 mu g L-1), risperidone (0.92-0.98 mu g L-1) and chlorpromazine (0.52 mu g L-1) were found in at least one sampling point. In the case of most analytes, the highest concentrations were determined at sampling point A, which are derived from the psychiatric wing. The environmental risk quotient for clozapine, chlorpromazine and risperidone was >600, a very high-risk index, which signals the need for a better control of the emission of antipsychotics and an improvement of the wastewater treatment, especially, with regard to wastewater discharged from the hospital psychiatric wing.

AB The characteristics of bioaerosol emissions from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have attracted extensive attention. The anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A(2)O) process, which uses the activated sludge approach to wastewater treatment, is the most widely used process in WWTPs. Concentration, size distribution, population, and exposure risk from bacteria and fungi in bioaerosols of WWTPs using the A(2)O process were studied in this work. The results showed that the maximum concentration of airborne bacteria (1.00 x 10(4) Colony Forming Units per cubic meter (CFU m(-3))) and fungi (1.44 x 10(4) CFU m(-3)) occurred from the facility's aerobic tank, in summer. As one of the main factors affecting bioaerosol exposure risk, particle size distribution was related to season. The study found that particles larger than 3.3 gm in diameter were detected mainly in spring and summer, while particles less than 3.3 gm were detected mainly in autumn and winter, whether bacterial aerosol or fungal aerosol. In addition, pathogenic bacteria were observed in bioaerosols from WWTPs, with 18 of the 65 species of bacteria detected found to be potentially or opportunistically pathogenic, such as Chryseobacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Alcaligenes, Micrococcus, Pantoea, Enterobacter and Escherichia-Shigella. The presence of these pathogens further increased the exposure risk from bioaerosols. The results of an inhalation risk assessment for airborne bacteria and fungi indicated that potential adverse health risks for adults mainly occurred in spring, summer, and autumn. On this basis, it was concluded that WWTP operators should set up effective bioaerosol controls as soon as possible to protect the health of workers, and of residents near the plant.

AB PFOS and PFOA are two of the most abundant perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in the environment. Previous studies have reported they have a long half-life (up to five years) once they enter into the human body. Moreover, they can potentially promote the adipogenic process by activating PPARy. However, little is known about PFOS and PFOA chronic health impacts on humans. In this study, we employed primary human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and demonstrated that PFOS and PFOA exerted acute cytotoxicity and affected adipogenesis and osteogenesis at environmental and human relevant doses. In fact, PFOS and PFOA impaired the proper expression of CD90 (a surface antigen highly enriched in undifferentiated hMSCs) and promoted adipogenesis, presumably via their interaction with PPARy. Moreover, PFOA partly disturbed osteogenesis. Thus, our findings not only validated the health risks of PFOS and PFOA, but also revealed new potential long-term PFOS/PFOA impacts on humans.

AB An appropriate and precise identification of high-risk individuals to develop cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is of high importance to reduce these kinds of diseases, a major health concern worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this research was to evaluate prognostic CVD biomarkers in Mexican women exposed to inorganic arsenic via drinking water. Then, a cross-sectional study including 190 women was achieved. Urinary arsenic (UAs) levels were analyzed as exposure biomarker to that metalloid. While, plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (FABP4), adiponectin, and chemerin levels, hypertriglyceridemic waist (HW) phenotype, atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), and Framingham risk score (FRS) were assessed as prognostic CVD biomarkers. Mean UAs level detected in the evaluated urinary samples was 45.0 +/- 40.0 mu g/g creatinine. In addition, mean plasma ADMA, FABP4, chemerin and adiponectin levels were 0.68 mu mol/L, 20.3 ng/mL, 12.5 mu g/mL, and 255 ng/mL, correspondingly. Approximately, 54% of women participants displayed an HW phenotype. Regarding AIP and FRS values, 0.12 +/- 0.15 and 7.50 +/- 8.00 were found, respectively. Besides, strong and significant associations (p < 0.05) between UAs and AIP, ADMA, and FABP4 were distinguished. Also, after a multivariate analysis, the association between those variables persisted after adjustment for traditional risk factors of CVD. In conclusion, according to the results found in this research, the most sensible CVD biomarkers distinguished in this study were AIP, ADMA, and FABP4. Nevertheless, more studies are necessary to confirm the results found in this investigation.

AB Epidemiological and toxicological studies have shown that ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a healthy risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. Hyperphosphorylated tau is the common feature of numerous neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathy, which could be inhibited by insulin stimulation. However, the effects of PM2.5 on tau protein injury by disturbing the insulin signaling pathway still need to be illuminated. In present study, male C57BL/6 J mice were administered with PM2.5 to determine whether PM2.5 inhalation can induce tauopathy via the insulin resistance (IR) related pathway (IRS-1/AKT/GSK-3 beta signaling pathway). The results showed that PM2.5 treatment induced the generation of phosphorylated tau (P-tau) and contributed to the development of tauopathy because of the insulin signaling disorders in insulin targeting organs. As expected, the occurrence of central and peripheral IR and accompanying hyperinsulinemia aggravated the disturbance of the IRS-1/AKT/GSK-3 beta signaling pathway. These observations indicated that PM2.5 exposure led to neurodegenerative tau lesion, and insulin signaling pathway might be a potential therapeutic target for tauopathy.

AB The effect of biological soil crust (BSC) in paddy field on the immobilization and removal of heavy metal from irrigation water is an important issue. BSC was cultured in solutions with different concentrations of manganese (Mn) salt and cadmium (Cd) sulfate for 15 days. We analyzed the Mn, Cd and Fe contents in the BSC and investigated the effects of Mn salt on the Cd distribution in different binding-forms in BSC as well. The results show that Mn salt was effective at enabling BSC to immobilize the Cd, and its removal efficiency from irrigation water improved with an increase in the Mn concentration used. The removal of 50.00 mu g/L of Cd from irrigation water by BSC reached as high as 95.70% in present of 20.00 mg/L Mn. The highest obtained biological concentrated factor of BSC for Cd is similar to 2.7 x 10(4). The mainly Cd species (75%) in BSC is the non-EDTA extracted minerals. Based on the SEM-EDS and XPS analyses, it was reasonably inferred that the Mn ion was oxidized by Mn oxidizing bacteria (MOB), to yield the porous spongy-like birnessite with d-spacing of 2.31 angstrom, while Cd was scavenged and immobilized in the crystal lattice. The MOB was identified as Bacillus. This study provides a potentially novel method to decontaminate irrigation water polluted with Cd by using BSC in presence of Mn.

AB The accumulation of rare earth elements (REEs) in the environment has become an environmental safety issue that cannot be ignored. However, previous studies on the environmental risks of REEs have mostly been performed at the individual level. In this work, to explore the effects of REE pollution at the population level, the effects of lanthanum (III) [La(III)] on the aboveground modules of soybean (Glycine max L) populations at different planting densities were investigated by simulating La(III) pollution, and the underlying mechanism was revealed on the physiological and biochemical levels of respiration. The results showed that the addition of 0.4 and 1.2 mM La(III) decreased the aboveground module growth parameters of the soybean populations, and this effect was more evident in the 1.2 mM La(III) treatment. At a certain dose of La(III), the effects of La(III) on the aboveground module growth parameters decreased with increasing plant densities. In addition, the effects of La (III) on the aboveground module growth parameters of soybean plants at different planting densities were related to plant respiration, in particular, to changes in the activities of respiratory key enzymes. The results indicated that the inhibitory effects of La(III) depended on the dose and on the planting density. This finding could provide a novel perspective and a basis for the objective assessment of potential environmental risks of REEs.
   One sentence summary: La(III) pollution effects on the aboveground modules of soybean populations are related to the changes of the population respiration and the respiratory key enzymes; moreover, these effects are restricted by the population density.

AB Although the potential link exists between behavioral responses to UV-B radiation and the maximization of fitness, molecular mechanisms of these UV-B induced behaviors remain poorly understood. For the first time, we investigated the transcriptomes of covered (CB), sheltered (SB) and non-protected (NA) sea urchins Strongylocentrotus intermedius exposed to UV-B radiation. A total of 330 differentially expressed genes were revealed by transcriptome comparisons. By comparing with the group NA, we found 79 up-regulated and 118 down-regulated genes in SB group, as well as 26 up-regulated and 67 down-regulated genes in group CB. There were 34 up-regulated genes and 52 down-regulated genes in group SB, compared with group CB. These differentially expressed genes failed to enrich either Gene Ontology (GO) or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), only except an enrichment in KEGG. We highlighted TRPA1 and Opsin as key neurobiological genes involved in the molecular mechanisms of covering and sheltering behaviors of sea urchins exposed to UV-B radiation. What's more, other identified genes provide valuable resources for future investigations on the molecular basis of covering and sheltering behaviors of sea urchins.

AB Mercury pollution of water bodies exerts significant human and ecosystem health impacts due to high toxicity. Relatively high levels of mercury have been detected in the Amazon River and its tributaries and associated lakes. The study employed a Bayesian Network approach to investigate the contribution from geogenic sources to mercury pollution of lakes in the Madeira River basin, which is the largest tributary of the Amazon River. It was found that the source indicators of naturally occurring mercury have both, positive and negative relationships with mercury in lake sediments. Although the positive relationships indicated the influence of geological and soil formations, the negative relationships implied that the use of mercury amalgam for gold extraction in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), which is the primary anthropogenic source of mercury, also contribute to mercury in Amazon tributaries. This was further evident as mercury concentrations in lake sediments were found to be significantly higher than those in the surrounding rocks. However, potential anthropogenic mercury was attributed to historical inputs from gold mining due to the recent decline of ASM mining practice in the region.

AB In cork industry, the operation of boiling raw cork generates large volumes of wastewater named Cork Boiling Wastewater (CBW). The main characteristics are the low biodegradability and medium to low acute toxicity, resulting in the necessity of designing advanced biological treatments by possible conventional activated sludge adaptation. In order to evaluate the variation of bacterial population along that process, a study based on optical microscopy, plate count, DNA extraction, qPCR and massive sequencing techniques was performed. Results showed a diminution of the total and volatile solids (TSS and VSS), jointly with a decrease in DNA concentration, general bacteria (16 S) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). After a few hours of testing, diverse microbiological species died while others showed a possible adaptation of the biological system, accompained by a dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reduction. In addition, toxicity tests based on activated sludge showed the development of chronic toxicity through the contact time. Combination of classical and advanced microbiological techniques, such as quantitative real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) and metagenomics, was essential to predict the variation of species during the experiment and to conclude if effective biological adaptation could be finally attained for the target complex wastewater.

AB Aiming to a better understanding sources contributions and regional sources of fine particles, a total of 273 filter samples (159 of PM2.5 and 114 of PM1.0) were collected per 8 h during the winter 2016 at a southwest suburb of Beijing. Chemical compositions, including water soluble ions, organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC), as well as secondary organic carbon (SOC), were systematically analyzed and estimated. The total ions concentrations (TIC), OC, and SOC of PM2.5 were with the following order: 16:00-24:00 > 08:00-16:00 > 00:00-08:00. Since primary OC and EC were mainly attributed to the residential combustion in the night time, their valley values were observed in the daytime (08:00-16:00). However, the highest ratio value of SOC/OC was observed in the daytime. It is because that SOC is easily formed under sunshine and relatively high temperature in the daytime. Positive matrix factorization (PMF), clustering, and potential source contribution function (PSCF) were employed for apportioning sources contributions and speculating potential sources spatial distributions. The average concentrations of each species and the source contributions to each species were calculated based on the data of species concentrations with an 8 h period simulated by PMF model. Six likely sources, including secondary inorganic aerosols, coal combustion, industrial and traffic emissions, road dust, soil and construction dust, and biomass burning, were contributed to PM2.5 accounting for 29%, 21%, 17%, 16%, 9%, 8%, respectively. The results of cluster analysis indicated that most of air masses were transported from West and Northwest directions to the sampling location during the observation campaign. Several seriously polluted areas that might affect the air quality of Beijing by long-range transport were identified. Most of air masses were transported from Western and Northwestern China. According to the results of PSCF analysis, Western Shandong, Southern Hebei, Northern Henan, Western Inner Mongolia, Northern Shaanxi, and the whole Shanxi provinces should be the key areas of air pollution control in China. The exposure-response function was used to estimate the health impact associated with PM2.5 pollution. The population affected by PM2.5 during haze episodes reached 0.31 million, the premature death cases associated with PM2.5 reached 2032. These results provided important implication for making environmental policies to improve air quality in China.

AB This study aims to investigate the occurrence, distribution and risk assessment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Dongjiang Lake of China. Twenty two kinds of VOCs were detected, and the major VOCs were alkene compounds. The total concentration of VOCs (Sigma VOCs) ranged from 2.93 to 4.69 mu g/L, and none of the VOCs detected in Dongjiang Lake exceeded the concentration limits set in the National Drinking Water Quality Standards (GB5749-2006) or the National Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB3838-2002) of China. Risk quotients (RQ) model, Multimedia Environment Pollutant Assessment System (MEPAS) and value of odor hazard index (OHI) were used to assess the ecological risk, lifetime carcinogenic risk and olfactory risk of VOCs in Dongjiang Lake, respectively. The RQ(totol) values varied from 3.95 x 10(-3) to 0.34 and the RQ values for all the 22 detected VOCs in 12 sample locations of Dongjiang Lake were below 0.01, which means negligible risk to aquatic organisms. The cancerous and non-cancerous risk indices were in the range of 2.31 x 10(-9)-5.16 x 10(-7) and 1.68 x 10(-7)-1.45 x 10(-2), respectively. Bromodichloromethane and 1,1-dichloroethene were associated with the highest and lowest carcinogenic risks in all 12 sample locations. Results also demonstrated that the olfactory risk in Dongjiang Lake is negligible. These data suggest that the VOCs in Dongjiang Lake may not lead great ecological and health risks for organism and human.

AB Soil serves as a vast matrix for heavy metal accumulation and subsequent redistribution to critical aspects of the environment such as groundwater. Soil pollution study is essential for sustainable human health and ecosystem protection. This study provides vital insight into the fate, accumulation, interactions, and health risk posed by heavy metals in soil and groundwater by employing geochemical accumulation index (Igeo), risk assessment models and multivariate data analysis techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), preference ranking organisation method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE) and geometrical analysis for interactive aid (GAIA). The median I-geo estimates show moderate to strong Pb accumulation levels whilst all the other metals indicate uncontaminated to moderate levels. The PCA output point to anthropogenic origin of Pb and Cd in the Tano Basin and surrounding communities. PROMETHEE-GAIA results indicate that Pb, Cd, Zn and Fe accumulated in the soil matrix may potentially leach into the groundwater resources. The carcinogenic lifetime risks posed by Pb, Cd, and Ni metals to adults are within the tolerable acceptable risk and thus do not present an immediate danger in the study area. Due to the significant toxicity, bioaccumulation and biomagnification properties of Pb and Cd in the environment, areas associated with significant anthropogenic activities require regular monitoring and evaluation in order to ensure that these metals are consistently below the regulatory limits. This study has further elucidated the subject of heavy metal pollution and is therefore expected to enhance sustainable protection of the environment and human health.

AB A sensitive and fast ultrasound-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedure combined with ion mobility spectrometry has been developed for the simultaneous extraction and determination of bendiocarb and azinphos-ethyl. Experimental parameters affecting the analytical performance of the method were optimized: type and volume of extraction solvent (chloroform, 150 pL), pH (9.0), type and volume of buffer (ammonium buffer pH = 9.0, 4.5 mL) and extraction time (3.0 min). Under optimum conditions, the linearity was found to be in the range of 2-40 and 6-100 ng/mL and the limits of detection (LOD) were 1.04 and 1.31 ng/mL for bendiocarb and azinphos-ethyl, respectively. The method was successfully validated for the analysis of bendiocarb and azinphos-ethyl in different samples such as waters, soil, food and beverage samples.

AB The use of pesticides in rice can not only manage the pest but also influence non-target organisms. The rove beetle (Paederus fuscipes), which is an important predator of the brown plant hopper (Nilaparvata lugens) in rice ecosystems, was tested to investigate acute and chronic effects of emamectin benzoate. The results from this study show that the LC50 of emamectin benzoate to adults of P. fuscipes at 72 h was 3.07 (1.84-4.54) mg a.i. L-1, whereas the LC50 of emamectin benzoate to the second instar larvae of P. fuscipes at 72 h was 2.58 (1.95-3.19) mg a.i. L-1. Tested sublethal doses (LC10 and LC30) had significant effects on the second instar developmental time of P. fuscipes compared with that of the control. The LC30 dose had a negative influence on the pre-imaginal developmental duration and the feeding potential of treated P. fuscipes larvae. Additionally, the LC30 reduced the pre-oviposition period, the fecundity and the body weight of adults emerged from treated larvae of P. fuscipes. In the sublethal experiment with adults, the fecundity and the feeding potential were significantly reduced at the LC30 dose. These results revealed that sublethal doses of emamectin benzoate negatively affected the development and biological activities of P. fuscipes, and we conclude that more attention should be paid to the use of this chemical as part of integrated pest management strategies.

AB Arsenite-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) play a key role in the biogeochemical cycle of arsenic in the environment, and are used for the bioremediation of As contaminated groundwater; however, it is not yet known about how arsenic affects biofilm formations of AOB, and how biofilm formations affect bacterial arsenite-oxidizing activities. To address these issues, we isolated seven novel AOB strains from the arsenic-contaminated soils. They can completely oxidize 1.0 mM As(III) in 22-60 h. Their arsenite oxidase sequences show 43-99% identities to those of other known AOB. Strains Cug1, Cug2, Cug3, Cug4, and Cug6 are able to form biofilms with thickness of 15-95 mu m, whereas Cug8 and Cug9 cannot form biofilms. It is interesting to see that arsenite inhibited the biofilm formations of heterotrophic AOB strains, but promoted the biofilm formations of autotrophic strains in a concentration-dependent manner. The arsenite-oxidizing rates of Cug1 and Cug4 biofilms are 31.6% and 27.6% lower than those of their suspension cultures, whereas the biofilm activities of other strains are similar to those of their suspension cultures. The biofilm formation significantly promoted the bacterial resistance to arsenic. This work is the first report on the complex correlations among environmental arsenic, bacterial biofilm formations and bacterial arsenite-oxidizing activities. The data highlight the diverse lifestyle of different AOB under arsenic stress, and provide essential knowledge for the screening of efficient AOB strains used for constructions of bioreactors.

AB The uptake, translocation and accumulation behaviours of imidacloprid in six leafy vegetables, including Xiadi cabbage (XDC), Huaguan cabbage (HGC), Gaogengbai (GGB), Shanghaiqing (SHQ), Kangresijiqing (KRQ) and Ziyoucai (ZYC), were investigated under hydroponic conditions. Seedling stage (S-stage), rapid growth stage (R-stage) and maturation stage (M-stage) for each vegetable were considered. The root concentration factor (RCF), translocation factor (TF) and bioconcentration factor (BCF) were used to compare the difference. The results show that during 48 h of exposure, the total amount of imidacloprid taken up by the test vegetables increased with vegetable growth; however, the imidacloprid concentration in vegetable tissues varied significantly according to the variety and growth stage. For individual vegetables, imidacloprid was most easily accumulated into HGC and GGB shoots at R -stage, but into XDC, KRC and ZYC shoots at S -stage. For varieties, the ability of accumulating imidacloprid from solution to shoots seemed to follow the order of GGB > XDC > SHQ > KRQ > HGC > ZYC. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed significant negative correlations between daily transpiration and logBCF and between logRCF and logTF, indicating that the difference of uptake, translocation and accumulation behaviours of imidacloprid in vegetable varieties and growth stages may be related to the daily transpiration and the ability of concentrating imidacloprid in vegetable roots.

AB Carryover effects of UV-B radiation are largely unknown in marine invertebrates, despite the ecological importance. For the first time, we investigated fitness related traits of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius 8 weeks after short-term (1 h) UV-B radiations (0, 10 and 20 mu W cm(-2)). Short-term UV-B radiations had significant negative effects on survival, food consumption, test diameter, test height, test height:test diameter, gonad weight and crude protein of gonads of S. intermedius, despite of the absence of UV-B radiation for 8 weeks. Survival, food consumption and crude protein of gonads were significantly lowest in S. intermedius exposed to UV-B radiation at 20 mu W cm(-2), highlighting that 20 mu W cm(-2) is a dangerous UV-B radiation intensity for the fitness of sea urchins (at least S. intermedius). Gonads were significantly more sensitive to UV-B radiation than the gut. The present study increases our understanding of carryover effects of UV-B radiations on sea urchins and provides valuable information into marine environmental safety.

AB This study examined the effects of a range of 1/2-log concentrations of emamectin benzoate (commercially applied as SLICE (R)) and ivermectin (commercially applied as IVOMEC (R)) on juvenile American lobster, Homarus americans. Phase I of the research assessed acute (up to 4 days) and chronic (30-day) toxicity of sediment dosed with the active ingredients emamectin benzoate (EMB) formulated as SLICE (R) or ivermectin (IVM) formulated as IVOMEC (R) at various nominal concentrations (EMB: 15, 48, 150, 475 and 1500 ng g(-1) wet sediment; IVM: 3, 9.5, 30, 95 and 300 ng g(-1) wet sediment) on juvenile Atlantic lobster (stages IV). Phase II evaluated sublethal effects (e.g., growth, moulting success) of all lobster surviving past the 30 day exposure period, over an additional 41 days. Chemical analysis of EMB and IVM in sediment samples from the exposure tanks revealed a strong linear association (R-2 values 0.99 and 0.98 for EMB and IVM, respectively) between nominal dose and measured concentration of compound. EMB exposure concentrations at very high levels (>= 343.3 ng g(-1)) were acutely toxic to juvenile lobster such that 100% of lobsters had died after 13 days of exposure. The maximum cumulative mortality of lobsters exposed to the highest concentrations of EMB and IVM was 100% after 10 days and 25 days, respectively. The 10-day LC50 estimates (+/- 95% CI) for EMB and IVM were 250.23 +/- 90.4 and 212.14 +/- 202.64 ng g(-1), respectively. Using abnormal behaviour as an indicator, the 15-day EC50 estimates (+/- 95% CI) for EMB and IVM were 96.19 +/- 51.42 and 15.82 +/- 6.93 ng g(-1), respectively. The NOEC (no observed effect concentration) for abnormal behaviour was 0.0 ng g(-1) for each product and the LOEC (lowest observed effect concentration) was 8.8 and > 3.0 ng g(-1) for EMB and IVM, respectively. Observations on sublethal effects included delayed moulting to stage VI and reduced growth at higher exposure concentrations for both therapeutants. Using failure to moult to stage V or VI as an indicator, the 15-day EC50 estimates (+/- 95% CI) for EMB and NM were 32.72 +/- 18.26 and 14.00 +/- 12.43 ng g(-1), respectively. The NOEC for failure to moult to stage V only was 343.3 and 14.7 ng g(-1) for EMB and IVM, respectively. Whereas, the LOEC was 1066.7 and > 61.0 ng g(-1) for EMB and IVM, respectively. The concentrations of EMB and IVM tested in the present study were acutely toxic to juvenile lobster exposed to the highest dosages (343.3 and 1066.7 ng EMB g(-1) and 61.0 and 300.0 ng NM g(-1)). There was significant evidence of chronic toxicity, longer exposure increased mortality with LT50 values decreasing with increasing test material concentration.

AB Particulate matter (PM) is one of the most harmful inhaled pollutants. When pollutants are emitted into the atmosphere, the only possible method for cleaning the air is through phytoremediation, where plants act as biological filters for pollutants. However, PM also has negative impacts on plants, although knowledge concerning the effects of PM on vegetation remains limited. In this work, an attempt was therefore made to define the amount of PM and waxes on foliage, and to evaluate the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus in seven plant species (three trees, three shrubs and one climber) grown in two locations (centre and suburbs of Warsaw) that differed in their level of PM pollution in the air.
   More PM and waxes accumulated on the foliage of plants grown in the highly polluted location. These plants also exhibited a lowered efficiency of their photosynthetic apparatus, manifested by a lower photosynthesis rate that corresponded with an increased stomatal resistance. Plants grown in the more polluted environment also showed decreased values of F-v/F-m parameter and no statistically significant trend to increase total chlorophyll content. Among the tested species, Betula pendula Roth accumulated the greatest amount of PM and Physocarpus opulifolius L. showed no weakening of its parameters of photosynthesis in a more contaminated environment.

AB Understanding soil mercury (Hg) accumulation, spatial distribution, and its sources is crucial for effective regulation of Hg emissions. We chose a study area covering approximately 100 km(2) representing one of the rapid growing industrial towns of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China, to explore soil Hg accumulation. In surface soil, total Hg ranged from 310 to 3760 mu g/kg, and 53% samples exceeded the most generous Chinese soil critical value (1500 mu g/kg). Hg concentration in rice ranged from 10 to 40 mu g/kg, and 43% samples exceeded the regulatory critical value (20 mu g/kg). Total Hg concentrations in soil profiles gradually decreased, reaching background levels up to 60 cm profile depth. Meanwhile, proportions of mobile, semi-mobile and non-mobile Hg to total Hg at every soil depth were similar, leading us to deduce that soil Hg has accumulated in this area over a long period. Total and bioavailable Hg in topsoil exhibited the highest concentrations in the center of the study area, and radially decreased towards the periphery, which might be explained by the distribution of industry and the prevailing wind. To trace the Hg sources, we selected soil and atmospheric dust samples for isotope analysis. Hg isotopic composition of surface soil (delta Hg-202 = -0.29 +/- 0.10 parts per thousand and Delta Hg-199 = 0.03 +/- 0.03 parts per thousand) was close to that of atmospheric dust (delta Hg-202 = -0.54 +/- 0.10 parts per thousand and Delta Hg-199 = 0.03 +/- 0.05 parts per thousand), but considerably different from Hg isotopic composition in subsoil (delta Hg-202 = -0.90 +/- 0.09 parts per thousand and Delta Hg-199 = -0.04 +/- 0.04 parts per thousand). Thus, we speculated that atmospheric deposition could change Hg isotopic composition in topsoil. Our findings suggest that when Hg atmospheric dust deposition changes Hg levels in surface soil, soil remediation, and crop safety might be compromised.

AB Drinking water treatment residuals (WTRs), the by-product of water clarification processes, are routinely disposed of via landfill however there is a growing body of research that demonstrates the material has great potential for beneficial use in environmental applications. Application to agricultural land is one option showing great promise (i.e. a low cost disposal route that provides organic matter input to soils and other potential benefits), however questions remain as to the impact such applications may have on earthworm survival and behaviour and also on the potential effects it may have on soil porewater chemistry. This study examined the leachability of elements within two types of WTRs (one Al- and one Fe- based) from England via 0.001 M CaCl2 solution, at varying pH, and via the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction scheme. Earthworm avoidance, survival, growth, reproduction and element concentrations were examined in WTR-amended sandy soils (0%, 5%, 10%, 20% w/w), while soil porewaters were also recovered from experimental units and examined for element concentrations. The results revealed leachable element concentrations to be very low in both types of WTRs tested and so element leaching from these WTRs would be unlikely to pose any threat to ecosystems under typical agricultural soil conditions. However, when the pH was lowered to 4.4 there was a substantial release of Al from the Al-WTRs (382 mg/kg). Soil porewater element concentrations were influenced to some degree by WTR addition, warranting further examination in terms of any potential implications for nutrient supply or limitation. Earthworm avoidance of WTR-amended soil was only observed for Al-WTRs and only at the maximum applied rate (20% w/w), while survival of earthworms was not affected by either WTR type at any application rate. Earthworm growth and reproduction (cocoon production) were not affected at a statistically significant level but this needs further examination over a longer period of exposure. Increased assimilation of Al and Fe into earthworm tissues was observed at some WTR application rates (maximum fresh weight concentrations of 42 mg/kg for Al and 167 mg/kg for Fe), but these were not at levels likely to pose environmental concerns.

AB There are fewer reports on plant growth promoting (PGP) bacteria living in nodules as helper to tolerance to abiotic stress such as salinity and drought. The study was conducted to isolate rhizobial and non-rhizobial drought and salinity tolerant bacteria from the surface sterilized root nodules of alfalfa, grown in saline soils, and evaluate the effects of effective isolates on plant growth under salt stress. Based on drought and salinity tolerance of bacterial isolates and having multiple PGP traits, two non-rhizobial endophytic isolates and one rhizobial endophytic isolate were selected for further identification and characterization. Based on partial sequences of 16 S rRNA genes, non-rhizobial isolates and rhizobial isolate were closely related to Klebsiella sp., Kosakonia cowanii, and Sinorhizobium meliloti, respectively. None of the two non-rhizobial strains were able to form nodules on alfalfa roots under greenhouse and in vitro conditions. Co-inoculation of alfalfa plant with Klebsiella sp. A36, K. cowanii A37, and rhizobial strain S. meliloti ARh29 had a positive effect on plant growth indices under salinity stress. In addition, the single inoculation of non-rhizobial strains without rhizobial strain resulted in an increase in alfalfa growth indices compared to the plants non-inoculated and the ones inoculated with S. meliloti ARh29 alone under salinity stress, indicating that nodule non-rhizobial strains have PGP potentials and may be a promising way for improving effectiveness of Rhizobium bio-fertilizers in salt-affected soils.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of drinking-water treatment residuals (DWTR) in the amendment of a soil affected by mining activities (Aljustrel mine, Portuguese sector of the Iberian Pyrite Belt), considering the effects on its chemical, biochemical and ecotoxicological characteristics. The DWTR had neutral characteristics (pH 6.7) and an organic matter (OM) content of 575 g kg(-1) dry matter (DM), which makes them a potential amendment for the remediation of mine degraded soils, as they may correct soil acidity and reduce the extractable metal fraction. An incubation assay, with soil and DWTR, with or without lime, was carried out to test the doses to be used in the assisted-phytostabilization experiment. Based on the results obtained, the doses of DWTR used were the equivalent to 48, 96, and 144 t DM ha(-1), with and without lime application (CaCO3 11 t DM ha(-1)). Agrostis tenuis Sibth was used as the test plant. Some amendments doses were able to improve soil characteristics (pH and OM content), to decrease metal extractability by 0.01 M CaC1(2) (especially for Cu and Zn), and to allow plant growth, that did not occur in the non-amended soil. Copper, Pb and Zn concentrations in the plant material were lower than the maximum tolerable level for cattle feed, used as an indicator of risk of entry of those metals into the human food chain. The simultaneous application of DWTR (96 and 144 t ha(-1)), with lime, allowed a reduction in the mine soil ecotoxicity, as evaluated by some lethal and sub-lethal bioassays, including luminescence inhibition of Vibrio fischeri, Daphnia magna acute immobilization test, mortality of Thamnocephalus platyurus, and 72-h growth inhibition of the green microalgae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. However, DWTR were unable to increase soil microbial activity, evaluated by dehydrogenase activity, an important soil-health indicator. Also, OM content and N-kjeidahl, concentrations increased slightly but remained low or very low (P and K extractable concentrations were not affected). In general, the bioassays highlighted a decrease in soil ecotoxicity with the presence of lime and DWTR (144 t DM ha(-1)). In conclusion, DWTR are recommended to amend acidic soils, with high concentrations of trace elements, but an additional application of organic or mineral fertilizers should be considered.

AB Smelting of nonferrous metals is an important source of heavy metals in surface soil. The crops/vegetables grown on contaminated soil potentially impose adverse effects on human health. In this study, the contamination level of five heavy metals (Hg, Pb, Zn, Cd and Cu) in ten types of vegetables grown nearby a large scale Pb/Zn smelter in Hunan Province, China and the health risk associated with their consumption are assessed. Based on the data obtained from 52 samples, we find that Pb and Cd contributed to the greatest health risk and leafy vegetables tend to be more contaminated than non-leafy vegetables. Within 4 km radius of the smelter, over 75% of vegetable samples exceeded the national food standard for Pb; over 47% exceeded the Cd standard; and 7% exceeded the Hg standard. Heavy metal concentrations in vegetables measured within the 4 km radius are on average three times more elevated compared to those found at the control area 15 km away. Heavy metals in vegetables have dual sources of root absorption from soil and leaf adsorption from atmosphere. Health risk in terms of the hazard index (HI) at contaminated areas are 3.66 and 3.14 for adults and children, respectively, suggesting adverse health effects would occur. HI for both groups are mainly contributed by Pb (48%) and Cd (40%). Fortunately, vegetable samples collected at the control area are considered safe to consume.

AB Because the extensive use of Cu-based fungicides, the accumulation of Cu in agricultural soil has been widely reported. However, little information is known about the bioavailability of Cu deriving from different fungicides in soil. This paper investigated both the distribution behaviors of Cu from two commonly used fungicides (Bordeaux mixture and copper oxychloride) during the aging process and the toxicological effects of Cu on earthworms. Copper nitrate was selected as a comparison during the aging process. The distribution process of exogenous Cu into different soil fractions involved an initial rapid retention (the first 8 weeks) and a following slow continuous retention. Moreover, Cu mainly moved from exchangeable and carbonate fractions to Fe-Mn oxides-combined fraction during the aging process. The Elovich model fit well with the available Cu aging process, and the transformation rate was in the order of Cu(NO3)(2) > Bordeaux mixture > copper oxychloride. On the other hand, the biological responses of earthworms showed that catalase activities and malondialdehyde contents of the copper oxychloride treated earthworms were significantly higher than those of Bordeaux mixture treated earthworms. Also, body Cu loads of earthworms from different Cu compounds spiked soils were in the following order: copper oxychloride > Bordeaux mixture. Thus, the bioavailability of Cu from copper oxychloride in soil was significantly higher than that of Bordeaux mixture, and different Cu compounds should be taken into consideration when studying the bioavailability of Cu-based fungicides in the soil.

AB A novel composite, EPIDMA/D301, with high adsorption capacity and particular affinity toward Cr(VI) was well prepared utilizing cationic polyelectrolyte poly-epichlorohydrin-dimethylamine (EPIDMA) impregnated in the networking pores of the styrene macroporous weak basic anion exchange resin D301. The physicochemical characteristics of EPIDMA/D301 were characterized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), zeta potential, FTIR, SEM-Mapping and XPS. The adsorption properties were researched via the influence of the concentration of EPIDMA, adsorbent dose, pH, the initial concentration of Cr(VI) solution, contact time and temperature. Results presented that the weakly basic anion exchange resin supported cationic polymer showed the excellent potential of removing Cr(VI) ions primarily due to the nonspecific Cr(VI) adsorption resulted from the polymeric host D301, the electrostatic attraction of amino groups fixed on the D301 matrix and the embedded EPIDMA with Cr (VI) ions and the ion exchange by the displacement of Cl(- )mainly derived from EPIDMA with Cr(VI) ions. The kinetic data were best fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The batch equilibrium data followed Langmuir isotherm model well with the maximum adsorption capacity of 194 mg g(-1) at 25 degrees C, which demonstrated that the styrene anion exchange resin modified with EPIDMA might be an efficient approach to eliminate potentially toxic metals.

AB Perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) is an important perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) precursor used for commercial applications. In order to investigate the transformation and responses of selected antioxidant and degradation enzymes of FOSA in the plants, in vivo exposure of soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) and pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima L.) were conducted in the solution-plant microcosms. FOSA was readily taken up by soybean and pumpkin roots and translocated to shoots, and metabolized to PFOS, perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS). Although morphological and biomass effects were not visible, significant changes in oxidative stress response were observed except for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities were significantly increased by 19.2-30.8% and 19.2-20.7% in soybean (8-12 d) respectively, and increased by 39.2-92.8% and 21.1-37.6% in pumpkin (3-12 d) respectively, suggesting an activation of the antioxidant defense system in the plants exposed to FOSA. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were decreased in soybean (2-12 d) with 9.0-36.1% inhibition and increased in pumpkin (3-12 d) with 22.5-47.3% activation respectively; cytochrome P450 (CYP450) activities were increased markedly in soybean and pumpkin with 13.2-53.6% and 26.7-50.2% activation respectively, giving indirect evidences on the involvement of CYP450 and GST in degradation of FOSA in plants.

AB Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), a group of anaerobic prokaryotes, can use sulfur species as a terminal electron acceptor for the oxidation of organic compounds. They not only have significant ecological functions, but also play an important role in bioremediation of contaminated sites. Although numerous studies on metabolism and applications of SRB have been conducted, they still remain incompletely understood and even controversial. Fully understanding the metabolism of SRB paves the way for allowing the microorganisms to provide more beneficial services in bioremediation. Here we review progress in bioenergetics mechanisms and application of SRB including: (1) electron acceptors and donors for SRB; (2) pathway for sulfate reduction; (3) electron transfer in sulfate reduction; (4) application of SRB for economical and concomitant treatment of heavy metal, organic contaminants and sulfates. Moreover, current knowledge gaps and further research needs are identified.

AB A degradation study of quizalofop-p and its commercial products (quizalofop-p-ethyl, quizalofop-p-tefuryl and propaquizafop) in water samples has been performed using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Orbitrap-MS). CHHQ (dihydroxychloroquinoxalin), CHQ (6-chloroquinoxalin-2-ol) and PPA ((R)-2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)propionicacid) were the main metabolites of this active substance (quizalofop-p) in water. The degradation of the parent compound has been monitored in distilled water. Several commercial products (Panarex (R), Master-D (R) and Dixon (R)) were used to evaluate the degradation of the target compounds into their metabolites. The concentration of the main active substances (quizalofop-p-tefuryl, quizalofop-p-ethyl and propaquizafop) decreased during the degradation studies, whereas the concentration of quizalofop-p increased. DT50 of the main active substances ranged from 10 days to 70 days for most of the analytes, so it can be concluded that compounds are medium-high persistent in this matrix. Metabolites, such as PPA, CHHQ and CHQ, were detected in water samples after 7 days of the application of the commercial products at concentrations higher than their limits of quantification (> 0.1 mu g/L). CHQ was detected at 1400 mu g/L after 75 days of the application of quizalofop-p-ethyl commercial product. CHHQ and CHQ were found at the highest concentrations at 7-45 days after the application of quizalofop-p-tefuryl, whereas PPA was detected at higher concentrations (up to 5.37 mu g/L) in propaquizafop samples.

A question remains unanswered is, how an integrated approach may be utilized to account for various contrasting soil properties, plant types (reference vs. native) and the nature of the hydrocarbon contamination. In this study, we utilized bacterial DNA profiling techniques to investigate the relationship between soil properties, contaminant and plant species. Results identified that Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the most abundant bacteria of the 45 phyla identified in the hydrocarbon contaminated soil. The bulk and rhizosphere microbiome showed that the contaminated soil originally had quite distinct bacterial communities compared to the artificially contaminated soil (mine soil = 95 genera vs. other soils = 2-29 genera). In these cases, not significantly but the native plant slightly increased bacterial diversity and relative abundance in the same soils. Also, within each site, the bacterial community was significantly altered with the hydrocarbon concentration. In this instance, the influence of the contaminant was strong and also with the soil pH and organic matter. These results would significantly contribute to the novel insights on the molecular technique-based hydrocarbon toxicity assessment and the development of the further integrative approach with other microbial community and their metabolic profile in the contaminated sites.

AB The current study was undertaken to elucidate the impact of the herbicide pretilachlor (314 ml(-1) and 6 pg ml(-1)) on cyanobacteria, Nostoc nnisconan ATCC 27893 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 under three levels of photoacclimatization (suboptimum, 25 limo' photon m(-2) S-5; optimum, 75 mop' photon m(-2) S-1; and supra optimum, 225 pistol photon m(-2) S-1) by analyzing certain physiological (biomass accumulation, photosynthesis, Chl a fluorescence and respiration) and biochemical parameters (photosynthetic pigments- chlorophyll a, carotenoids and phycocyanin; reactive oxygen species- O-2(-), H2O2, lipid peroxidation; antioxidant system-superoxide dismutase, peroxidise, catalase and glutathione-S-transferase). The light conditioning played the most prominent role in deciding the extent of herbicide toxicity on both the tested cyanobacteria as the maximum toxicity was observed in suboptimum light acclimatized cyanobacterial cells corroborated by the least growth in the same cells. The impact of pretilachlor treatment on photosystem II photochemistry viz. ipPo, W, (go, PIABs, ABS/RC, TRo/RC, E'To/RC and DIo/RC was also altered by light acclimatization. The percent rise in oxidative stress markers (SOR and H2O2) and consequent lipid peroxidation (MDA equivalents) were also highest in suboptimum light acclimatized cells exposed to pretilachlor which could not be prospered with compatible antioxidant performance. Conversely, supra-optimum light acclimatized cells of both the cyanobacteria was found to accelerate the activities of all the studied enzymes and thus able to counterbalance the pretilachlor toxicity and supported the healthier growth.

AB Cadmium is a natural and widely distributed toxicant, and can be commonly found in environment. Intestinal microbiota plays a very important role in maintaining its host's health. The effects of cadmium on the intestinal microbiota composition and stability of amphibians are little known. We exposed Rana chensinensis (R. chensinensis) embryos to different concentrations of cadmium (0, 112 and 448 mu g Cd L-1) until they reached Gosner stage 38, and analyzed their microbial communities using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. By measures of both alpha and beta diversity, intestinal microbial communities were significantly differentiated in 448 mu g Cd L-1 exposure groups. Cadmium exposure significantly altered the intestinal microflora diversity and composition of R. chensinensis. At the phylum level, it is worth noting that Fusobacteria and Spirochaetae were not detected in 448 mu g Cd L-1 exposure groups. Firmicutes rapidly decreased in 448 mu g Cd L-1 exposure group. At the genus level, Succinispira (Firmicutes), Desulfovibrio (Proteobacteria) and Fusobacterium (Fusobacteria) vanished in 448 mu g Cd L-1 exposure groups. Our results demonstrate that cadmium exposure changed the composition and decreased the community diversity of intestinal microbiota of R. chensinensis tadpoles. Our study may provide a new framework based on intestinal microbiota to evaluate the response of amphibians to environmental chemicals pollution.

AB Imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) have attracted increasing attention in recent years. The IL 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ({C(12)mim]Cl) has been widely used in the chemical industry. In this study, the influence of [C(12)mim]Cl on Vicia faba seedlings, soil physicochemical properties and soil enzyme activities was investigated for the first time. Meanwhile, the variation of [C(12)mim]Cl concentrations in soil was monitored during the exposure period. The present results showed that the concentration of [C(12)mim]Cl remained stable in the tested soil with a change rate of no more than 10% during the exposure period. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) values for shoot length, root length and dry weight were 188, 69 and 132 mg kg(-1), respectively. At 200 mg kg(-1) and 400 mg kg(-1), [C(12)mim]Cl had significant influence on soil organic matter content, pH value and conductivity value. At 40 mg kg(-1), the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were obviously enhanced, resulting in oxidative stress effects in Vicia faba seedling leaves. Additionally, the soil enzyme activities changed significantly at 40 mg kg(-1).

AB In the present study, Helianthus annuus grown in arsenic- (As) and lead- (Pb) contaminated soil were treated with plant-growth promoting fungi Trichoderma sp. MG isolated from decayed wood and assessed for their phytoremediation efficiency. The isolate MG exhibited a high tolerance to As (650 mg/L) and Pb (500 mg/L), and could remove > 70% of metals in aqueous solution with an initial concentration of 100 mg/L each. In addition, the isolate MG was screened for plant-growth-promoting factors such as siderophores, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase, indole acetic acid (IAA) synthesis, and phosphate solubilisation. Phytoremediation studies indicated that treatment of H. annuus with the isolate MG had the maximum metal accumulation in shoots (As; 67%, Pb; 59%). Furthermore, a significant increase in the soil extracellular enzyme" activities was observed in myco-phytoremediated soils. The activities of phosphatase (35 U/g dry soil), dehydrogenase (41 mg TPF/g soil), cellulase (37.2 mg glucose/g/2 h), urease (55.4 mg N/g soil/2 h), amylase (49.3 mg glucose/g/2 h) and invertase (45.3 mg glucose/g/2 h) significantly increased by 12%, 14%, 12%, 22%, 19% and 14% in As contaminated soil, respectively. Similarly, the activities of phosphatase (31.4 U/g dry soil), dehydrogenase (39.3 mg TPF/g soil), cellulase (37.1 mg glucose/g/2 h), urease (49.8 mg N/g soil/2 h), amylase (46.3 mg glucose/g/2 h), and invertase (42.1 mg glucose/g/2 h) significantly increased by 11%, 15%, 11%, 18%, 20% and 14% in Pb contaminated soil, respectively. Obtained results indicate that the isolate MG could be a potential strain for myco-phytoremediation of As and Pb contaminated soil.

AB Seeking new efficient hydrocarbon-degrading yeast stains was the main goal of this study. Because microorganisms are greatly affected by the environmental factors, the biodegradation potentiality of the microorganisms varies from climatic area to another. This induces research to develop and optimize the endemic organisms in bioremediation technology. In this study, 67 yeast strains were tested for their growth potentiality on both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. The most efficient six strains were identified using sequence analysis of the variable D1/D2 domain of the large subunit 26S ribosomal DNA. The identity of these strains was confirmed as Yamadazyma mexicana KKUY-0160, Rhodotorula taiwanensis KKUY-0162, Pichia kluyveri KKUY-0163, Rhodotorula ingeniosa KKUY-0170, Candida pseudointermedia KKUY-0192 and Meyerozyma guilliermondii KKUY-0214. These species are approved for their ability to degrade both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons for the first time in this study. Although, all of them were able to utilize and grow on both hydrocarbons, Rhodotorula taiwanensis KKUY-0162 emerged as the best degrader of octane, and Rhodotorula ingeniosa KKUY-170 was the best degrader of pyrene. GC-MS analysis approved the presence of many chemical compounds that could be transitional or secondary metabolites during the utilization of the hydrocarbons. Our results recommend the application of these yeast species on large scale to approve their efficiency in bioremediation of oil -contamination of the environment. Using these yeasts, either individually or in consortia, could offer a practical solution for aquatic or soil contamination with the crude oil and its derivatives in situ.

AB Despite significant recent advancement in research, biogeochemical behavior of heavy metals with respect to their applied form is still topical. Moreover, metal toxicity to plants may vary with their stage of development/maturity. Therefore, this study for the first time evaluated the influence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and citric acid (CA) on cadmium (Cd) accumulation and toxicity to germinating and young pea seedlings as well as in younger and older leaves. The experimental setup of current study consisted of two separate studies. The first study was performed on germinating seedlings grown in a Cd-contaminated sand media. Pea seeds were treated with two levels of Cd (Cd-25 and Cd-100) alone and combined with different levels of EDTA and CA. The second study was carried out in hydroponic solution. The influence of organic amendments on Cd accumulation and toxicity to pea plants was evaluated by determining Cd contents in pea seedlings, H2O2 contents, chlorophyll contents and lipid peroxidation in younger and older leaves.
   Cadmium stress caused overproduction of H2O2 in roots and leaves of pea seedlings. Cadmium-induced overproduction of H2O2 caused a decrease in the pigment contents and increased lipid peroxidation. Application of EDTA at higher levels (81 and 200 mu M) increased Cd accumulation by pea plants. However, CA did not affect Cd accumulation by pea. Both EDTA and CA increased Cd-induced H2O2 production and lipid peroxidation. Younger pea leaves showed more sensitivity to Cd stress compared to older leaves. Similarly, Cd toxicity was more pronounced in germinating seedlings than young seedlings. Moreover, Pearson correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) showed very interesting correlations between treatments and stress responses of germination and young seedlings as well as younger and older leaves. Based on multivariate analysis, it is proposed that the Cd toxicity to pea plants greatly vary with its growth stage and the maturity of organs (younger or older leaves).

AB In this study, digestate from winery wastes was investigated focusing on phytotoxicity using macrophytes and evaluating the potential contribution of ammonium and copper. Spreading of digestate on soil could represent a suitable approach to recycle nutrients and organic matter, creating an on site circular economy. In this study, digestate quality was evaluated considering both chemical-physical characteristics and biological toxicity applying germination test. The effluent did not meet the entire amendment quality standard defined by Italian law (Decree 75/2010 germination index > 60% with solution of 30% v/v of digestate), but bio-stimulation was observed at low doses (3.15-6.25% v/v) for S. alba and S. saccharatum. The beneficial concentration agreed with Nitrate Directive dose and suggested that limited addition of digestate could have several positive effects on soil characteristics and on crop growth. Specific test using ammonium and copper solutions showed that these pollutants were not directly correlated to observed phytotoxicity.

AB Two phase bioreactor was constructed, designed and developed to evaluate the chlorpyrifos remediation. Six biotic and abiotic factors (substrate-loading rate, slurry phase pH, slurry phase dissolved oxygen (DO), soil water ratio, temperature and soil micro flora load) were evaluated by design of experimental (DOE) methodology employing Taguchi's orthogonal array (OA). The selected six factors were considered at two levels L-8 array (2(boolean AND)7, 15 experiments) in the experimental design. The optimum operating conditions obtained from the methodology showed enhanced chlorpyrifos degradation from 283.86 mu g/g to 955.364 mu g/g by overall 70.34% of enhancement. In the present study, with the help of few well defined experimental parameters a mathematical model was constructed to understand the complex bioremediation process and optimize the approximate parameters upto great accuracy.

AB Freshwater microcosms were used to investigate the effects of various metals and polycyclic aromatic hydro-carbons (PAHs), applied as single substances and in mixtures, on sediment-inhabiting nematode assemblages. Several community measures, including nematode abundance, biomass, species richness, species composition and the NemaSPEAR[%]-index, were assessed and their changes in response to the chemical treatments were compared with the results of single-species toxicity testing using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The diagnostic power of endpoints revealing toxic effects was then evaluated to assess the general suitability of nematodes as bioindicators of sediment contamination by a set of relevant chemicals. Overall, community measures based on species-level (detected with principle response curves) responded most sensitively to chemical stress in the microcosms, especially in terms of biomass, with the C. elegans toxicity test was for the most part as sensitive to the chemicals as the nematode species composition.
   Generally, this study justified the suitability of nematodes in assessments of the risk of chemicals frequently associated with freshwater sediments and underlined the value of C. elegans in the prospective risk assessment of chemicals, as this species was able to indicate the negative effects of comparatively low sediment concentrations of the contaminants.

AB The BP-contracted Deepwater Horizon Macondo well blowout occurred on 20 April 2010 and lasted nearly three months. The well released millions of barrels of crude oil into the northern Gulf of Mexico, causing extensive impacts on pelagic, benthic, and estuarine fish species. The bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli) is an important zooplanktivore in the Gulf, serving as an ecological link between lower trophic levels and pelagic predatory fish species. Bay anchovy spawn from May through November in shallow inshore and estuarine waters throughout the Gulf. Because their buoyant embryos are a dominant part of the inshore ichthyoplankton throughout the summer, it is likely bay anchovy embryos encountered oil in coastal estuaries during the summer and fall of 2010. Bay anchovy embryos were exposed to a range of concentrations of two field-collected Deepwater Horizon oils as high-energy and low-energy water accommodated fractions (HEWAFs and LEWAFs, respectively) for 48 h. The median lethal concentrations (LC50) were lower in exposures with the more weathered oil (HEWAF, 1.48 mu g/L TPAH50; LEWAF, 1.58 mu g/L TPAH50) compared to the less weathered oil (HEWAF, 3.87 mu g/L TPAH50; LEWAF, 4.28 mu g/L TPAH50). To measure delayed mortality and life stage sensitivity between embryos and larvae, an additional 24 h acute HEWAF exposure using the more weathered oil was run followed by a 24 h grow-out period. Here the LC50 was 9.71 mu g/L TPAH50 after the grow-out phase, suggesting a toxic effect of oil at the embryonic or hatching stage. We also found that exposures prepared with the more weathered Slick B oil produced lower LC50 values compared to the exposures prepared with Slick A oil. Our results demonstrate that even relatively acute environmental exposure times can have a detrimental effect on bay anchovy embryos.

AB Acid rain is one of main environmental pressure which limit growth and yield of crops worldwide.
   To clarify tolerant mechanism in crops to acid rain, we investigated the response of simulated acid rain on accumulation of reactive oxygen species, membrane stability, antioxdative enzymes activities and their genes expression levels and thereafter recovery mechanism (without simulated acid rain). After being exposed to simulated acid rain (pH 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 or 4.0) for 5 days, malondialdehyde content and membrane permeability in rice leaves showed no differences from those of the control, and concentrations of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase) activities did not differ from those of the control as well. Simulated acid rain at pH 3.5 increased activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase by up-regulating expression of Cu/Zn-SOD, CAT1 and POD1 at transcriptional level as well as ascorbic acid content to maintain the content of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide in cells closed to the control level, and then oxidative damage were not occurred (malondialdehyde content and membrane permeability were no different from the control) in rice leaves. However, simulated acid rain at pH 3.0 or pH 2.5 caused the increase in malondialdehyde and membrane permeability by increasing contents of superoxide anion and hydrogen which exceeded the scavenging ability of antioxidant enzymes regulated by expression of Cu/Zn SOD, CAT1 and POD1 and ascorbic acid. These results show that activities of SOD (Cu/Zn SOD), CAT (CAT1) and POD (POD1) and ASA could play predominant roles in tolerance of rice to oxidative damages induced by acid rain, and can be indicating indices for reflecting tolerance of plants to acid rain. Besides, the regulating effect of antioxidant system on acid-tolerance of plants was limited by intensity of acid rain.

AB Comparative distribution and mobility of selected essential and toxic metals in the paddy soil from district Sargodha, Pakistan was evaluated by the modified Community Bureau of Reference (mBCR) sequential extraction procedure. Most of the soil samples showed slightly alkaline nature while the soil texture was pre-dominantly silty loam in nature. The metal contents were quantified in the exchangeable, reducible, oxidisable and residual fractions of the soil by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry and the metal data were subjected to the statistical analyses in order to evaluate the mutual relationships among the metals in each fraction. Among the metals, Ca, Sr and Mn were found to be more mobile in the soil. A number of significant correlations between different metal pairs were noted in various fractions. Contamination factor, geoaccumulation index and enrichment factor revealed extremely severe enrichment/contamination for Cd; moderate to significant enrichment/contamination for Ni, Zn, Co and Pb while Cr, Sr, Cu and Mn revealed minimal to moderate contamination and accumulation in the soil. Multivariate cluster analysis showed significant anthropogenic intrusions of the metals in various fractions.

AB Landfill leachate treatment is an ongoing challenge in the wastewater management of existing sanitary landfill sites due to the complex nature of leachates and their heavy pollutant load. There is a continuous interest in treatment biotechnologies with expected added benefits for resource recovery; microalgal bioremediation is seen as promising in this regard.
   Toxicity reduction of landfill leachate subsequent to phycoremediation was investigated in this study. The treatment eventuated from the growth of the ammonia tolerant microalgal strain Chlamydomonas sp. SW15aRL using a N:P ratio adjustment in diluted leachate for facilitating the process. Toxicity tests ranging over a number of trophic levels were applied, including bacterial-yeast (MARA), protistean (microalgae growth inhibition test), crustacean (daphnia, rotifer) and higher plant (monocot, dicot) assays.
   Ammonia nitrogen in the diluted landfill leachate containing up to 158 mg l(-1) NH4+ -N (60% dilution of the original) was reduced by 83% during the microalgal treatment. Testing prior to remediation indicated the highest toxicity in the crustacean assays Daphnia magna and Brachionus calyciflorus with EC50s at 24 h of similar to 35% and 40% leachate dilution, respectively. A major reduction in toxicity was achieved with both bioassays post microalgal treatment with effects well below the EC20s. The microalgae inhibition test on the other hand indicated increased stimulation of growth after treatment as a result of toxicity reduction but also the presence of residual nutrients. Several concurrent processes of both biotic and abiotic natures contributed to pollutant reduction during the treatment. Modifying phosphate dosage especially seems to require further attention. As a by-product of the remediation process, up to 1.2 g l(-1) of microalgal biomass was obtained with similar to 18% DW lipid content.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the fate of nine potential indicator antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) sul2, tetB, tetM, ermB, ermF, fexA, cfr, intl1) and the diversity of bacterial communities in response to poultry manure applications to arable soil over a 90 day period. Quantitative real time PCR and Illumina high throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA gene were used to quantify and trace ARG fate. The levels of all genes dramatically decreased over time and intl1, sul1, sul2 and tetM always had the greatest abundance and lowest dissipation rates. This indicated that more effort should be focused on the ARG elimination from manure rather than waiting for subsequent attenuation in the environment. Our sequencing results documented dramatic changes in the microbial community structure and diversity during these experiments. In poultry manure groups, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were the two dominant phyla while Acidobacteria dominated the control groups. Moreover, the relative abundance of genera Coiynebacterium, Pseudomonas, Ochrobactrum, Actinomadura and Bacillus, which contained potential opportunistic pathogens, changed over time suggesting that poultry manure not only strongly influenced bacterial community composition, but also selected specific bacterial communities. This study provides a glimpse of ARG fates and bacterial community diversity in soil after the application of poultry manure.

AB Atrazine is widely used in agriculture. In this study, dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soils under four types of land use (forest (F), meadow (M), cropland (C) and wetland (W)) was used to investigate the binding characteristics of atrazine. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix-parallel factor (EEM-PARAFAC) analysis, two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) and Stern-Volmer model were combined to explore the complexation between DOM and atrazine. The EEM-PARAFAC indicated that DOM from different sources had different structures, and humic-like components had more obvious quenching effects than protein-like components. The Stern-Volmer model combined with correlation analysis showed that log K values of PARAFAC components had a significant correlation with the humification of DOM, especially for C3 component, and they were all in the same order as follows: meadow soil (5.68) > wetland soil (5.44) > cropland soil (5.35) > forest soil (5.04). The 2D-COS further confirmed that humic-like components firstly combined with atrazine followed by protein-like components. These findings suggest that DOM components can significantly influence the bioavailability, mobility and migration of atrazine in different land uses.

AB Today's world needs to control the industrial pollution through smarter ways. Presently, we observed the capacity of soil borne fungi to digest Synozol Red HF-6BN and Synozol Black B. Initially, 86 fungal strains were isolated from soil samples randomly collected from industrial sites. Among these, 31 isolates were capable of dye decolorization on solid media, with SN12f and SN13a isolates showed the highest decolorization capacity. The dye decolorization by both strains was higher (80-95%), when incubated for 120 h under optimized conditions of pH, concentration, nutrient source and temperature. The dye (Synozol red HF-6BN and Synozol black B) decolorization by SN12f isolate was maximum ((>)90%) at pH7, whereas the SN13a decolorized 90% of Synozol red HF-6BN and 89% of Synozol black B at pH3. The SN13a and SN12f isolates at 40 mg/L showed decolorization of 94.71%, 81.4% (for Synozol red HF-6BN) and 90.5%, 84.4% (Synozol black B), respectively. Our isolates also mitigated the toxic effect of azo dyes on the growth of phosphate solubilizing soil bacteria. In fact, the untreated effluent showed toxic effects on the growth of beneficial bacterial by developing zone of inhibition (16.5 mm around Aeromonas spp., 14.5 mm around Sailmonella while 14.25 mm around Citrobacter spp). However, the fungal treated dye was unable to develop zone of inhibition. Lactase activity was positive for both of fungal isolates after incubation on Bassnell Hass Medium (0.0733 U/mL for SN12f and 0.0439 U/mL SN13a). Using molecular approaches (ITS region), SN12f was identified as Aspergillus nidulans, while SN13a as Aspergillus fumigatus. The current study showed that local fungal flora can reclaim the contaminated soils and support the agro-friendly micro-flora.

AB Transgenerational effects induced by environmental stressors are a threat to ecosystems and human health. However, there is still limited observation and understanding of the potential of chemicals to influence life outcomes over several generations. In the present study, we investigated the effects of two environmental contaminants, coumarin 47 and permethrin, on exposed zebrafish (FO) and their progeny (F1-F3). Coumarin 47 is commonly found in personal care products and dyes, whereas permethrin is used as a domestic and agricultural pyrethroid insecticide/insect repellent. Zebrafish (F0) were exposed during early development until 28 days post-fertilization and their progeny (F1-F3) were bred unexposed. On one hand, the effects induced by coumarin 47 suggest no multigenerational toxicity. On the other hand, we found that behavior of zebrafish larvae was significantly affected by exposure to permethrin in F1 to F3 generations with some differences depending on the concentration. This suggests persistent alteration of the neural or neuromuscular function. In addition, lipidomic analyses showed that permethrin treatment was partially correlated with lysophosphatidylcholine levels in zebrafish, an important lipid for neurodevelopment. Overall, these results stress out one of the most widely used pyrethroids can trigger long-term, multi- and possibly transgenerational changes in the nervous system of zebrafish. These neurobehavioral changes echo the effects observed under direct exposure to high concentrations of permethrin and therefore call for more research on mechanisms underlying effect inheritance.

AB In China, many studies have been carried out on pesticide residues in human milk, yet all of them are on organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and mostly focused on large, economically developed cities. In this study, 27 pesticides including OCPs, pyrethroid pesticides (PYRs) and organophosphate pesticides (OPPs) in human milk were investigated in Jinhua, an inland and medium sized city in China. Method based on QuEChERS extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) determination was adopted to analyze the above pesticide residues. The influencing factors as well as the health risks were also evaluated. Results show that PYRs and OPPs in human milk samples were both undetectable. Regarding OCPs, the detection rate of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl-dichlomethylene (p,p'-DDE) were 83.6%, 36.4% and 58.2%, respectively, and their mean value were 29.4, 32.0 and 85.2 ng/g lipid, respectively. p,p '-DDE levels in human milk was significantly (p < 0.05) related to maternal age, but no association was detected between OCPs residues and other factors (living environment, dietary habit, living style, etc.), suggesting that OCPs in human milk in Jinhua were originated from nonspecific source. All estimated daily intake of pesticides (EDIpesticides) by infants were under the guideline suggested by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and China Ministry of Health (CMH). Yet 9% of EDIs(HCB) and 16% of EDIsHCHs exceeded the guideline recommended by Health Canada. The associations between DDE residues and the delivery way as well as HCBs residues and the birth weight were seemly significant, yet the significance disappeared when consider age or gestational age as a cofounder, indicating that OCPs residue in mother's body in Jinhua has no obvious influence on fetus development and the delivery way.

AB Eutrophication is a global problem, and bacterial diversity and community composition are usually affected by eutrophication. However, limited information on the ecological significance of bacterial community during algae blooms of rivers has been given, more studies should be focused on the bacterial diversity and distribution characteristics in eutrophic rivers. In this study, we explored the spatial variations of bacterial biomass, community structure, and their relationship with environmental factors in the eutrophic Xiangxi River. The content of Chlorophyll (Chl) was about 16 mg/L in the midstream (S2, S3), which was in the range of light eutrophication. Significant spatial variation of bacterial community structure was found at different sites and depths (p < 0.05), and the driving environmental factor was found to be nitrogen, mainly detected as total nitrogen (TN), Kjeldahl nitrogen (KN), and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+) (p < 0.05). The midstream sites had some significantly different bacteria, including algicidal bacteria and dominant lineages during algal blooms. This result was consistent with the functional prediction, where significant higher abundance of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways was associated with algicidal substances in the midstream. At different water depths, some populations adapted to the surface layer, such as the class Flavobacteriia, and others preferred to inhabit in the bottom layer, such as Betaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria. The bacterial biomass was higher in the bottom layer than that in the surface and middle layer, and temperature and pH were found to be the major driving factors. The bacterial diversity increased with the increasing of depths in most sampling sites according to operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Chao1 and ACE indexes, and PO43- was demonstrated to be the most significant factor. In summary, this study offered the evidence for microbial distribution characteristics across different sites and depths in summer, and its relationship with environmental variables in a eutrophic river.

AB Tebuconazole (TEB) is a common triazole fungicide that is widely used throughout the world in agriculture applications. We previously reported that TEB induces cardiac toxicity in rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of the toxicity induced by TEB in cardiac cells. TEB induced dose-dependent cell death in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). The comet assay and western blot analysis showed a concentration-dependent increase in DNA damage and in p53 and p21 protein levels 24 h after TEB treatment. Our findings also showed that TEB triggered the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis as evidenced by a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (AIPm), an increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, an activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, a cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and an increase in the proportion of cells in the sub-G1 phase. In addition, TEB promoted ROS production in cardiac cells and consequently increased the amounts of MDA, the end product of lipid peroxidation. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine reduced TEB-induced DNA damage and activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. These results indicate that the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of TEB are mediated through a ROS-dependent pathway in cardiac cells.

AB In this study, hydroponic experiments were conducted to elucidate mechanism(s) that are associated with differential effects of low (5 mu M) and high (25 mu M) dose of cadmium (Cd) stress in tomato. Furthermore, emphasis has also been focused on any involvement of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in differential behaviour of low and high doses of Cd stress. At low dose of Cd, root growth i.e. root fresh weight, length and fitness did not significantly alter when compared to the control seedlings. Though at low dose of Cd, cellular accumulation of Cd was slightly increased but this was accompanied by higher endogenous H2S and phytochelatins, (L)-cysteine desulfhydrase (DES) activity, activities of glutathione biosynthetic and AsA-GSH cycle enzymes, and maintained redox status of ascorbate and glutathione. However, addition of hypotaurine (HT, a scavenger of H2S) resulted in greater toxicity, even at low dose of Cd, and these responses resembled with higher dose of Cd stress such as greater decline in root growth, endogenous H2S and phytochelatins, activities of DES, glutathione biosynthesis and AsA-GSH cycle enzymes, disturbed redox status of ascorbate and glutathione which collectively led to higher oxidative stress in tomato roots. Moreover, addition of HT with higher dose of Cd also further enhanced its toxicity. Collectively, the results showed that differential behaviour of low and high dose of Cd stress is mediated by differential regulation of biochemical attributes in which endogenous H2S has a crucial role.

AB In this study, the effect of two metal-immobilizing bacterial strains, Serratia liquefaciens CL-1 and Bacillus thuringiensis X30, on the availability of Cd and Pb and the metal accumulation in potato tubers, as well as the underlying mechanisms in metal-contaminated soils were characterized. Moreover, the impacts of the strains on metal immobilization, pH, and NH4+ concentration in metal-contaminated soil solutions were evaluated. Strains CL-1 and X30 increased tuber dry weight by 46% and 40%, reduced tuber Cd and Pb contents by 68-83% and 42-47%, and decreased the Cd and Pb translocation factors by 61-70% and 30-34%, respectively, compared to the controls. Strains CL-1 and X30 decreased the available Cd and Pb contents by 52-67% and 30-44% and increased the NH4+ content by 55% and 31%, pH, urease activity by 70% and 41%, and relative abundance of ureC gene copies by 37% and 20% in the rhizosphere soils, respectively, compared with the controls. Reduced Cd and Pb concentrations and increased pH and NH4+ concentration were found in the bacteria-inoculated soil solution compared to the controls. These results suggested that the strains reduced tuber metal uptake through decreasing the metal availability and increasing the pH, ureC gene relative abundance and urease activity as well as decreasing the metal translocation from the leaves to tubers. These results may provide an effective metal-immobilizing bacteria (especially strain CL-1)-enhanced approach to reduce metal uptake of potato tubers in metal-polluted soils.

AB Tembotrione is a triketone group herbicide having worldwide applications for weed management in maize. It is considered to be less stable in the environment and its degradation products may have toxicological consequences due to longer persistence and off-site movements. We studied the persistence behavior and leaching potential of tembotrione and its major metabolite TCMBA in clay loam and sandy loam soils having different physico-chemical properties. The rapid transformation of parent tembotrione to degradation products and their high interactions with soil provided challenging task of residues separation from complex soil matrix. Therefore, a novel sample preparation method (modified QuEChERS) was optimized for trace estimation of tembotrione and TCMBA which offered 86.6-95.6% recoveries with limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) as 0.001 and 0.003 mu g/g, respectively in both soils without any matrix interference. A first order dissipation kinetics was followed by tembotrione and TCMBA residues with half-life ranged from 7.2 to 13.4 days in both soils. Residues reached below detectable limit on 45-60 days after treatments in two application doses. Leaching experiment revealed maximum retention of tembotrione residues from 15 to 25 cm depth in both soils whereas TCMBA show appreciable leaching potential. It was concluded that tembotrione can be phytotoxic to the succeeding crops if applied at late post-emergence stage. TCMBA can contaminate surface and ground water due to continuous and prolonged use of tembotrione particularly in light textured soils.

AB Diamide insecticides, such as chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, and tetrachlorantraniliprole, are a new class of insecticides that selectively target insects by affecting calcium homeostasis. While this class of insecticides are effective on a wide range of insect pests, the toxicities of diamide insecticides vary among species and life stages. In this study, we addressed the mechanism underlying the different responses of Plutella xylostella and Pieris rapae to diamide insecticides. The susceptibility to insecticides of P. xylostella and P. rapae larvae was assessed 2 and 4 days after exposure to chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, and tetrachlorantraniliprole. P. xylostella larvae treated with distilled water (Group A), chlorantraniliprole (Group B), cyantraniliprole (Group C), and tetrachlorantraniliprole (Group D) and P. rapae larvae treated with distilled water (Group E), chlorantraniliprole (Group F), cyantraniliprole (Group G) and tetrachlorantraniliprole (Group H) were subjected to metabolomics analysis. The differential metabolites in the B vs. F, C vs. G, and D vs. H groups were analyzed, followed by pathway enrichment analysis. Chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, and tetrachlorantraniliprole all showed high toxicities for P. xylostella and P. rapae larvae. P. rapae larvae were more sensitive to the diamide insecticides than P. xylostella larvae. There were 65 overlapped differential metabolites between P. xylostella and P. rapae larvae treated with these three diamide insecticides. Pathway analysis showed that the differential metabolites were closely related with fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism-related pathways. The differential regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism may contribute to the different response to diamide insecticides in P. xylostella and P. rapae.

AB In this study, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was applied to degrade tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) with glucose as a co-metabolic substrate. Influencing factors of co-metabolic degradation such as pH, TBBPA and glucose concentration were examined and the degradation efficiency under optimal condition reached about 50% on the 7th day. The study also proved that the extracellular action, rather than intracellular one, played a leading role in TBBPA degradation. Five metabolites including debromination and beta-scission products were identified in this study. The extracellular active substance pyocyanin was considered as the origin of H2O2 and OH.. The variation of concentrations of H2O2 and OH. shared the same trend, they increased in the early days and then declined gradually. On the 1st day, the OD600 of P.aeruginosa in the co-metabolic group was 6.0 times higher than the initial value while total organic carbon (TOC) decreased about 78%, which might lead to the occurrence of pyocyanin auto-poisoning. Flow cytometry was applied to detect the cellular state of P.aeruginosa during degradation. The increasing intracellular ROS showed that cells were suffering from oxidative stress and the change of membrane potential revealed that cellular dysfunction had occurred since the 1st day. This research indicated that the toxic effect on P.aeruginosa was probably not directly correlated with TBBPA, but was caused by pyocyanin auto-poisoning.

AB Cadmium (Cd) is an extremely toxic environmental pollutant with high mobility in soils, which can contaminate groundwater, increasing its risk of entering the food chain. Yeast biosorption can be a low-cost and effective method for removing Cd from contaminated aqueous solutions. We transformed wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae (WT) with two versions of a Populus trichocarpa gene (PtMT2b) coding for a metallothionein: one with the original sequence (PtMT2b 'C') and the other with a mutated sequence, with an amino acid substitution (C3Y, named here: PtMT2b 'Y'). WT and both transformed yeasts were grown under Cd stress, in agar (0; 10; 20; 50 mu M Cd) and liquid medium (0; 10; 20 mu M Cd). Yeast growth was assessed visually and by spectrometry OD600. Cd removal from contaminated media and intracellular accumulation were also quantified. PtMT2b 'Y' was also inserted into mutant strains: fet3fet4, zrt1zrt2 and smf1, and grown under Fe-, Zn-and Mn-deficient media, respectively. Yeast strains had similar growth under 0 mu M, but differed under 20 mu M Cd, the order of tolerance was: WT < PtMT2b 'C' < PtMT2b 'Y', the latter presenting 37% higher growth than the strain with PtMT2b 'C'. It also extracted similar to 80% of the Cd in solution, and had higher intracellular Cd than WT. Mutant yeasts carrying PtMT2b 'Y' had slightly higher growth in Mn-and Fe-deficient media than their non-transgenic counterparts, suggesting the transgenic protein may chelate these metals. S. cerevisiae carrying the altered poplar gene offers potential for bioremediation of Cd from wastewaters or other contaminated liquids.

AB The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DCF) is considered a contaminant of emerging concern. DCF can co-exist with heavy metals in aquatic environments, causing unexpected risks to aquatic organisms. This study aimed to assess the combined effects of DCF and cadmium (Cd) at environmentally relevant concentrations on the bioconcentration and status of oxidative stress and detoxification in Chironomus riparius larvae. The larvae were exposed to DCF (2 and 20 mu g L-1) and Cd (5 and 50 mu g L-1) alone or in mixtures for 48 h. The combined exposure to DCF and Cd was found to reciprocally facilitate the accumulation of each compound in larvae compared with single exposures. As indicated by the antioxidant enzyme activities, reduced glutathione levels, and malondialdehyde contents, the low concentration of the mixture (2 mu g L-1 DCF + 5 mu g L-1 Cd) did not alter the oxidative stress status in larvae, while the high concentration of the mixture (20 mu g L-1 DCF + 50 mu g L-1 Cd) induced stronger oxidative damage to larvae compared with single exposures. The expression levels of eight genes (CuZnSOD, MnSOD, CAT, GSTd3, GSTe1, GSTs4, CYP4G, and CYP9AT2) significantly decreased due to the high concentration of the mixture compared with single exposures in most cases. Overall, the results suggest that the mixture of DCF and Cd might exert greater ecological risks to aquatic insects compared with their individual compounds.

AB Cation diffusion facilitators (CDFs) play central roles in metal homeostasis and tolerance in plants, but the specific functions of Camellia sinensis CDF-encoding genes and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Previously, transcriptome sequencing results in our lab indicated that the expression of CsMTP8.2 in tea plant shoots was down-regulated exposed to excessive amount of Mn2+ conditions. To elucidate the possible mechanisms involved, we systematically identified 13 C. sinensis CsMTP genes from three subfamilies and characterized their phylogeny, structures, and the features of the encoded proteins. The transcription of CsMTP genes was differentially regulated in C. sinensis shoots and roots in responses to high concentrations of Mn, Zn, Fe, and Al. Differences in the cis-acting regulatory elements in the CsMTP8.1 and CsMTP8.2 promoters suggested the expression of these two genes may be differentially regulated. Transient expression analysis indicated that CsMTP8.2 was localized to the plasma membrane in tobacco and onion epidermal cells. Moreover, when heterologously expressed in yeast, CsMTP8.2 conferred tolerance to Ni and Mn but not to Zn. Additionally, heterologous expression of CsMTP8.2 in Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that CsMTP8.2 positively regulated the response to manganese toxicity by decreasing the accumulation of Mn in plants. However, there was no difference in the accumulation of other metals, including Cu, Fe, and Zn. These results suggest that CsMTP8.2 is a Mn-specific transporter that contributes to the efflux of excess Mn2+ from plant cells.

AB Miscanthus x giganteus is suggested as a good candidate for phytostabilization of metal-polluted soils. Its late harvest in winter generates large amounts of leaf litter on the soil surface. However, little is known about the mobility and the bioavailability of metals following leaf decomposition and the consequences on the succeeding culture. Ex situ artificial aging for 1, 3, and 6 months was conducted with miscanthus leaf fragments incorporated into three agricultural soils displaying a gradient concentration in Cd (0.6, 3.1 and 7.9 mg kg(-1)), Pb (32.0, 194.6 and 468.6 mg kg(-1)), and Zn (48.4, 276.3 and 490.2 mg kg(-1)) to simulate the leaf litter input over 20 years of miscanthus culture. We investigated the impacts on physicochemical and biological soil parameters, CaCl2-extractable metal, and their subsequent ryegrass shoot concentrations, and hence on ryegrass health. The results showed that the amended soils possessed higher pH along with greater available phosphorous and soil organic carbon values. The respiratory activity and microbial biomass carbon in the amended soils increased mainly after 1 month of aging, and decreased afterwards. Despite the higher Pb- and Zn-CaCl2 extractability in the amended soils, the phytoavailability slightly increased only in the most contaminated soils. Moreover, leaf incorporation did not affect the ryegrass biomass, photosynthetic pigment contents, nor the antioxidative enzyme activities. Conclusively, leaf incorporation induced slight variations in soil physicochemical and biological parameters, as well as metal extractability, but not to an extent that might cause a considerable threat to the subsequent culture. Nevertheless, these results are preliminary data that require confirmation by long-term insitu experimentations as they reflect the modelization of long-term impact of leaf decomposition on soil-plant system.

AB Objectives: Based on a prospective birth cohort, we aimed to investigate the associations between maternal circulating metals exposure and gestational weight gain (GWG) across pregnancy, and explore whether maternal inflammatory cytokines could contribute to the GWG changes associated with metals exposure.
   Methods: A total of 234 pregnant women from the Shanghai Maternal-Child Pairs cohort were enrolled in this panel study. 547 blood and serum samples were collected from pregnant women during three follow-up visits, and the circulating concentrations of 27 metals were determined by using the ICP-MS method. Five inflammatory cytokines in serum samples were measured through multiplexed immunoassays. The linear mixed models were used to estimate the association between each ln-transformed metal concentration and GWG across pregnancy. Robust generalized linear regression models were used to estimate the associations among circulating metals, GWG, and inflammatory cytokines.
   Results: The GWG during pregnancy was 13.76 +/- 1.40 kg. The concentrations Co, Zn, Mo, B, Ag and Te in second or third trimesters were significantly higher than those in early second trimester. The concentration of Mg decreased with the increase of pregnant weeks and no significant statistical differences were found in the concentrations of other metals in different trimesters. Among the detected 26 metals, Li and Sr concentrations were positively associated with GWG in the third trimester. The GWG increased by 0.100 kg (95% CI 0.005, 0.195) and 0.120 kg (95% CI 0.009, 0.232) with each one ln-concentration increase in circulating Li and Sr concentrations, respectively. Concentrations of Li and Sr in the third trimester were positively associated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin (IL)-6, but negatively associated with growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) significantly. Besides, IL-6 and GDF-15 levels were associated with the increase or decrease of overall pregnancy GWG, respectively.
   Conclusions: Results showed that maternal exposure to Li and Sr were associated with increased GWG, in which maternal IL-6 and GDF-15 could contribute to the associations between metal exposures and GWG in pregnant women.

AB Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), the most commonly used plasticizer and typical endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), has shown its characteristics of causing reproductive and developmental toxicity in males, while the neuroendocrine toxicity induced by DBP exposure in utero and the mechanism beneath still remain unclear. Here, the pregnant mice were treated with corn oil (control) or DBP at three different doses by oral gavage during gestational days (GD) 12.5-21.5. The results showed that in utero exposure to DBP induced a significant increase of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) content in serum, as well as activation and proliferation of astrocytes in the hypothalamus of offspring male mice on postnatal day (PND) 22. However, in in vitro study, mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), the metabolite of DBP, could not increase the release of GnRH after GnRH neurons were exposed to MBP. Further studies identified that MBP-mediated activation and proliferation of astrocytes resulted in increased secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which might be responsible for the increased release of GnRH from GnRH neurons. This study highlights the neuroendocrine toxicity of current plasticizer DBP exposure, laying the foundation for identifying potential molecular targets for related diseases.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the bioaccumulation and oxidative damage of Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, exposed to four selected mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; benzo (a) pyrene (BaP), benzo (a) anthracene (BaA), benzo (b) fluoranthene (BbF), and chrysene (Chr) in equal proportion. For this purpose, clams were exposed to PAHs (BaP:BbF:BaA:Chr = 1:1:1:1) at different concentrations (0.05, 0.5, and 5 mu g/L) for 21 days, followed by a 15-day depuration period. All four PAHs accumulated in the gill, digestive gland, adductor muscle, and soft tissue of Manila clams, and all PAH treatment groups showed clear time and dose dependence. The decreasing order of bioaccumulation for the four PAHs in the exposure experiment was Chr > BaA > BaP > BbF. Moreover, the order of PAH bioaccumulation for the four tissues during the whole experiment was digestive gland > gill > soft tissues > adductor muscles. Although the initial concentrations of the four PAHs were the same, the final accumulated contents were different. Therefore, we also determined the detoxification processes of the four PAH mixtures in gills and digestive glands. The bioaccumulation of Chr was higher than the other three PAHs, probably because clams have a lower metabolic capacity for Chr than for BaP, BbF, and BaA. Exposure to PAH mixtures can result in oxidative damage, as indicated by the fact that DNA strand breaks, lipid peroxidation (LPO), and protein carbonyl (PC) were induced significantly (P < 0.05), except in the low-dose groups of PAHs, and different trends were detected with time of exposure. According to the correlation analysis, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, glutathione s-transferase, superoxide dismutase, DNA strand break, PC, and LPO in both the gill and digestive gland are potential early indicators of PAH mixtures. We investigated the accumulation rules of R. philippinarum exposed to the selected PAHs and screened the potential biomarkers. The results of our study provide important scientific information for the purpose of monitoring marine pollution.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the ecotoxic effect of high concentration cesium (Cs) exposure on plant root growth and its toxicological mechanism. The radicle of broad bean (Vicia faba) was selected as experimental material. The cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of plants exposed to different Cs levels (0.19-1.5 mM) for 48 h were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assays. The results showed that radicle elongation decreased clearly after 48 h of exposure treatment with different concentrations of Cs solution. The root cell structure was obviously damaged in the Cs treatment groups (0.19-1.5 mM). At a Cs concentration of 1.5 mM, the percentages of viable non-apoptotic cells, viable apoptotic cells, non-viable apoptotic cells, and nonviable cells were 40.09%, 20.67%, 28.73%, and 10.52%, respectively. SCGE showed DNA damage in radicle cells 48 h after Cs exposure. Compared with the control group, the percentage of tail DNA in Cs exposed group (0.38-1.5 mM) increased by 0.56-1.12 times (P < 0.05). RAPD results showed that the genomic stability of V. faba radicles decreased by 4.44%-15.56%. This study confirmed that high concentration Cs exposure had cytotoxicity and genotoxicity effects on plants.

AB Despite numerous investigations into AgNP-induced toxicity, little has been taken into consideration the potential health impacts of aged AgNPs in comparison to fresh AgNPs. In the current study, we scrutinized the potential effects of aged AgNPs in animals. We first found that AgNPs underwent morphological transformations after natural ageing in aqueous solution upon exposure to air and sunlight for 9 days, as characterized by significant aggregation with increase of particle size approximately by 2 fold. Meanwhile, dissolved Ag ions from aged AgNPs increased by 33% compared to fresh AgNPs. Strikingly, the acute exposure results showed that aged AgNPs induced lower toxicity in mice relative to fresh AgNPs. Aged AgNPs caused milder local inflammation in the peritoneal cavity of mice, as evidenced by 63% reduction of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha) than that induced by fresh AgNPs. The deposition mass of aged AgNPs in the liver, spleen, lung and kidney was diminished by 69%, 39%, 83% and 40%, respectively, compared to the distribution profiles in response to fresh AgNPs. Whereby, milder splenic hyperemia was observed, and no significant hepatoxicity was found. Additionally, aged AgNPs provoked milder increase of periphery leukocytes and malondialdehyde (MDA) in mice in comparison to fresh AgNPs. Taken together, this study unraveled that the ageing process elicited remarkable alterations to physicochemical properties and toxic effects as well. This study would provide new insights into the potential health impacts of AgNPs under transformation-determined exposure scenarios.

AB The mercury residue in soil not only poisons plants, but also bioaccumulates and biomagnifies through the food chain, causing a significant risk to human health. As an essential condiment on the table, the food safety of ginger should be focused on. Using soil culture experiments, this study aimed to identify the response of ginger growth to mercury pollution, assess the transmission and residue of mercury in different product organs and explore the mitigation mechanism of silicon on mercury toxicity. Effects of soil mercury pollution on ginger growth showed hormesis and time effect. Long-term mercury pollution led to growth inhibition and quality degradation of ginger, eventually reducing its yield by 25.96% (mercury = 9 mg kg(-1)). Contents of mercury and silicon in different organs both were the highest in root, followed by rhizome, less in stem and leaf, especially the mercury residue in rhizome manifested as Mother-ginger > Son-ginger > Grandson-ginger. At 6 mg kg(-1) soil mercury level, the mercury residue of Mother-ginger exceeds the edible pollutant limit standard (China) by 10.7 times, which makes no obvious risk after being consumed by adults, but poses a potential health threat to children. Notably, it is safer to consume the newly sprouted and inflated tender ginger. Application of silicon fertilizer could alleviate mercury toxicity, mainly by promoting ginger root growth and leaf pigment synthesis, stimulating water-gas exchange system, fluorescence system and antioxidant system to make an anti-stress response. 2 mg kg(-1) silicon fertilizer had the most significant mitigation effect on mercury stress, which increased the yield of ginger by 24.85% and reduced the mercury residue of ginger block by 44.44%-60.17%.

AB With the rapid development of ultra high voltage alternating current (UHV AC) transmission, the intensity of environmental power frequency electric field (PFEF) near UHV AC transmission lines increased continuously, which has attracted considerable public attention on the potential health effects of PFEF. In this study, the effect of PFEF exposure on the kidney was explored. Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were exposed to 35 kV/m PFEF (50 Hz). Two indicators relating to renal function (urea nitrogen and creatinine) were tested after the exposure of 7d, 14d, 21d, 35d and 49d. The pathological morphology and cellular ultrastructure of kidney were observed respectively by light microscopy and electron microscopy after the exposure of 25d and 52d. Results showed that compared with that of the control group, the concentration of urea nitrogen of 35 kV/m PFEF exposure group significantly increased on the 21st and 35th days, and the concentration of creatinine significantly increased on the 14th, 21st and 35th days. However, the concentrations of creatinine and urea nitrogen both returned to normal levels on the 49th day. Furthermore, an enlarged Bowman's space, the vacuolation of renal tubular epithelial cells and the foot process effacement of podocyte were found after 25d exposure, but no abnormality was observed after 52d exposure. Obviously, a short-term (35d) exposure of 35 kV/m PFEF could cause kidney injury, which could be recovered after a longer-term (52d) exposure. Based on this study and relevant literatures, one explanation for this two-way effect is as follows, Kidney injury was caused by the disequilibrium of mitochondrial dynamics under 35 kV/m PFEF exposure. PFEF could also activate Wnt/beta-catenin signal to promote the recovery of renal tubular epithelial cells and glomerular podocytes, so kidney injury could be repaired.

AB The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of different waterborne sublethal concentrations of Ag-NPs LC50 (96h) on common carp Cyprinus carpio using a multi-biomarker approach. Fish (9.22 +/- 0.12 g) were stocked in fiberglass tanks and exposed to concentrations of 0 (control), 12.5%, 25% and 50% of Ag-NPs LC50 (96h) or Ag-NO3 LC50 (96h), as the source of Ag+ ion, for a period of 21 days. At the end of study, tissue Ag contents were significantly (P < 0.05) higher and different in fish exposed to concentrations of 25% and 50% compared to the control. The numbers of RBCs, hematocrit, and MCHC values at these concentrations differed significantly in respect to the control. No significant effects were observed for hemoglobin, MCH, and MCV values. The number of WBCs was significantly higher at concentrations of 12.5% and 25% compared to the control, Meanwhile, the percentage of neutrophils significantly elevated at concentrations of 25% and 50%. Serum total protein at concentration of 50% detected significantly lower than that of 12.5% or the control. The serum albumin and globulin levels significantly declined in Ag-NPs-exposed groups versus the control. The serum ACH50 and total immunoglobulins showed significantly lower values in the treatments of 25% and 50% compared to the control. The serum glucose, cortisol, ALT, and ALP values significantly escalated upon Ag-NPs exposure. The serum SOD and CAT showed enhanced activity in the treatment of 12.5% vice versa significantly diminished at concentrations of 25% and 50% compared to the control. The exposure to the concentrations of 25% and 50% significantly dwindled the lysozyme activity and total immunoglobulin levels in skin mucus. In conclusion, sublethal concentrations of Ag-NPs LC50 (96h) impaired fish health status at higher concentrations and 12.5% of Ag-NPs LC50 (96h) was presumably safe for common carp aquaculture.

AB Learning is important for honey bee fitness and the pollination services that they provide. Neonicotinoid pesticides impair learning, fitness, colony health, and pollination, but most studies on how they affect bee learning have focused on olfactory learning. We tested the effects of field realistic doses of 0.8 ng/bee and 1.34 ng/bee of the neonicotinoid pesticide, thiamethoxam (TMX), on bee visual learning. We adapted a T-maze bioassay and classically conditioned bees to associate sugar reward with a simulated flower color (blue or yellow light) in a choice assay. At 1.34 ng/bee, TMX significantly reduced correct choices in the final learning trial as compared to the control treatment. There was no TMX effect in our 1-h memory test. We found stronger effects on decision time and abnormal behaviors. TMX decreased bee decision times, a potential byproduct of induced hyperactivity since bees walked to make choices. Behaviors (falling, trembling, and rapid abnormal movements) were significantly increased by both TMX doses as compared to the control treatment. These results suggest that the effects of neonicotinoids on bee visual learning should be further studied and incorporated into Risk Assessment protocols.

AB Neonicotinoids emerged as an environmentally safe alternative to previous generations of insecticides becoming one of the most widely applied in modern agriculture. Nevertheless, they have been reported to affect several non-target organisms. Most toxicity studies focus on the effects on pollinators or terrestrial invertebrates and evaluate either the active ingredient or the commercial formulation. In the present study, we aimed to assess the long-term effects of the active ingredient acetamiprid and a broadly used commercial formulation (Assail (R) 70) on the non-target freshwater gastropod Biomphalaria straminea using a battery of biomarkers. A 14 day-exposure of adult organisms to both active ingredient and commercial formulation increased carboxylesterase activity and glutathione content, inhibited superoxide dismutase activity and decreased reactive oxygen species levels. The commercial formulation additionally increased glutathione S-transferase activity and inhibited catalase activity. The results indicate a greater toxicity of the commercial formulation than that of the active ingredient alone. Cholinesterase activity, development and offspring survival of B. straminea were not impaired. We conclude that the toxicity of acetamiprid on this gastropod species is mainly related to effects on detoxification and oxidative metabolism responses. This study provides novel information about the adverse effects of the active ingredient and a commercial formulation of a widely used neonicotinoid on a non-target aquatic species.

The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of PM2.5 on intestinal and brain injury and on bacterial community structure in the intestine and feces of APP/PS1 transgenic mice exposed to PM2.5 for eight weeks with a real-world wholebody inhalation exposure system in Taiyuan, China. The brain and intestinal tissues were collected to evaluate histopathological changes by HE staining. TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels in intestines, brains, and serums, and A beta-42 levels in brains were detected. Intestinal and fecal samples were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results showed that PM2.5 significantly aggravated the pathological injury in intestines and brains in AD mice with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. The estimators of Shannon, Simpson, Chao1, and ACE indexes reflected the diversity and richness of the bacterial community. Compared with the FA-WT group, the FA-AD group had lower diversity and richness when the PM2.5-AD group had the highest ones. PCA and NMDS revealed the specific influence of PM2.5 on the bacterial community of intestine and feces because that the PM2.5-FA and PM2.5-AD group clumped visibly closer than the other groups in both bacterial communities of intestine and feces. The KEGG pathway analysis predicted the vital functional genes and metabolic pathways in the bacterial community of PM2.5-AD mice. This study indicated the histopathological changes and inflammation in the intestine and brain were seriously caused in PM2.5-AD mice when the alpha-diversity of the bacterial community in intestine and feces was visibly changed.

AB Day to day consumption of black pepper raise concern about the detailed information about their medicinal, pharmaceutical values and knowledge about the biocompatibility with respect to ecosystem. This study investigates the in vivo selective molecular biocompatibility of its seed cover (SC) and seed core (SP) powder extract using embryonic zebrafish model. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis of the extract prepared by grinding showed presence of different components with "piperine" as principle component. Biocompatibility analysis showed dose and time dependent selective effect of SC and SP with LC50 of 30.4 mu g/ml and 35.6 mu g/ml, respectively on survivability, hatching and heartbeat rate in embryonic zebrafish. Mechanistic investigation elucidated it as effect of accumulation and internalization of black pepper leading to their influence on structure and function of cellular proteins hatching enzyme (he1a), superoxide dismutase (sod1) and tumor protein (tp53) responsible for delayed hatching, oxidative stress induction and apoptosis. The study provided insight to selective biocompatibility of black pepper expedient to produce higher quality spices with respect to pharmaceutical, clinical and environmental aspects.

AB The ladybeetle Propylea japonica is a widely distributed natural enemy in many agricultural systems. P. japonica is often used as a test organism for safety assessments of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis crops. Plant varieties expressing the Vip3Aa insecticidal protein are not currently commercially available in China. In this study, protease inhibitor E - 64 was used as a positive control to examine the responses of P. japonica larvae to a high concentration of Vip3Aa proteins. Larvae that were fed E-64 had increased mortality and prolonged developmental period, but these parameters were unaffected when larvae were fed Vip3Aa. The epithelial cells of midguts were intact and closely connected with the basal membrane when larvae were fed Vip3Aa, but the epithelial cells degenerated in the E - 64 treatment. The activities of antioxidative enzymes and expression levels of detoxification-related genes in P. japonica larvae were not altered after exposure to Vip3Aa; however, these biochemical and molecular parameters were significantly changed in the E -64 treatment. The results demonstrate that Vip3Aa protein is not harmful to the predator P. japonica.

AB Extensive antibiotic exposure in the general population has been documented by bio-monitoring, but data regarding antibiotic burden across three generations in families living in the same household are lacking. We investigated the distribution of antibiotics and the potential health risk among the three generations by selecting 691 participants from 256 households in Fuyang city, China. A total of 45 antibiotics and two metabolites were screened in urine samples through liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. In total, 34 antibiotics were found in the samples with an overall detection frequency of 92.0%, and the detection frequencies of individual antibiotic ranged from 0.3% to 28.7%. Specifically, the concentrations of seven antibiotics (azithromycin, amoxicillin, oxytetracycline, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole) were extremely high (i.e., above 10, 000 ng/mL). The detection rates of tetracyclines were significantly different among the three generations, with parents having the highest detection rate. Penicillin V, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, enrofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin showed a higher detection frequency in parents, whereas tetracycline, danofloxacin, and ofloxacin were more likely to be found in grandparents. The proportions of the sum of the daily exposure dose of VAs and PVAs more than 1 mu g/kg/d in children, parents, and grandparents were 31.6%, 39.5%, and 26.5%, respectively. A hazard index (HI) greater than 1 was observed in 14.7% children, which was less than the 23.6% in parents and slightly higher than the 11.8% in grandparents. Ciprofloxacin was the biggest contributor to HI among the three generations. Collectively, these findings indicate that households are widely exposed to various antibiotics in Fuyang city, where parents had the highest health risk associated with the disturbance of gut microbiota.

AB To evaluate the effect of coal-burning arsenic (As) exposure on lung function and the potential underlying mechanisms, a total of 217 As-exposed subjects and 75 reference subjects were recruited into this study. Hair arsenic (H-As), pulmonary function tests, and serum inflammatory markers CC16, SP-A, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 were evaluated. Residents from As-exposed areas showed higher H-As concentrations (median 0.25 mu g/g) than subjects from the reference area (median 0.14 mu g/g). Large reductions in lung function parameters were noted in the As-exposed group. A significant negative correlation was observed between H-As concentrations and lung function. Specifically, monotonic negative dose-response relationships were observed between H-As and FEV1(%), FEV1/FVC (%) and FEF75 (%) (all P < 0.05), while the associations between H As and FVC (%), FEF25 (%), and FEF50 (%) were nonlinear (P for nonlinearity = 0.03, 0.001, 0.01, respectively). In addition, there was a direct positive relationship between H As and the inflammatory response. Alterations in inflammatory biomarkers (CC16, SP-A, MMP-9, and MMP-9/TIMP-1) were significantly associated with As-induced lung function impairment. Thus, this population-based study revealed that As exposure has significant toxic effects on lung function and increased inflammation may occur during this toxic process. We provide scientific evidence for an As-induced alteration in inflammatory biomarkers and pulmonary damage in an As exposed population. The results of this study can inform risk assessment and risk control processes in relation to human As exposure in coal-burning arsenicosis areas.

AB Ionic liquids (ILs) are acknowledged as green chemicals and favorable substitutes for volatile organic solvents, which are currently used. However, previous studies have shown that these compounds had toxicological impacts on aquatic organisms. To investigate the effects of 1-hexyl-3- methylimidazolium bromide ionic liquid ([C(6)mim]Br) on embryonic development and reproduction in water flea (Daphnia magna), a series of exposure experiments were conducted, including acute toxicity, maternal exposure, and chronic exposure tests. In acute toxicity experiment, D. magna neonates exhibited developmental abnormalities in the shell spine and the second antennae in a concentration-dependent manner after exposure to [C(6)mim]Br. The results in maternal exposure test also revealed a certain embryo-toxicity in response to [C(6)mim]Br in D. magna. However, the toxicity was lower than that conveyed by direct acute exposure, this indicated that the IL could act directly on organism. During the 21 days chronic exposure, the 1.6 mg/L exposure caused marked drop in the survival, molts and the number of the first brood of D. magna. Meanwhile, the total number of offspring was significantly declined in 1.6 mg/L concentration treatment groups, whereas increased in 0.2 mg/L groups. Generally, abnormalities in the offspring were significantly increased across all of the treatment groups in contrast to the control. No effect on sex differentiation was found during the experiments. These findings suggested that [C(6)mim]Br could affect embryonic development and reproduction in D. magna, and provided references for further study on the mechanisms underlying toxicological effects of ILs and the assessment of their potential environmental risks.

AB In this study a number of heavy metals namely chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), barium (Ba), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), rubidium (Rb), selenium (Se) are studied in the floor and air condition (AC) filter dust collected from urban and rural households of Saudi Arabia. To the best of our knowledge, many of these heavy metals are reported for the very first time in the indoor dust of Saudi Arabia. Studied metals were higher in urban dust than rural except Mn and Rb which were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in rural dust. All metals, except Cd, Zn, and Ba in urban settings, were detected at higher (P < 0.05) levels in AC filter dust than household floor dust from both rural and urban residential settings. Levels of the two dominant metals i.e., Zn and Mn were up to 1600 and 700 mu g/g, respectively in studied dust samples. Also associations between heavy metals and a number of different socio-economic parameters were studied which was significant for some trace metals. In literature exposure to many of trace metals are associated with various health problems, therefore health risk assessment for the Saudi population was calculated by incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) and hazardous index (HI) via dust ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. The ILCR for all metals was within the tolerable range of reference values of USEPA (1 x 10(-11) to 1 x 10(-4)). However, calculated HI for Mn, Cu, Ni, and Zn was more than 1 via dust exposure, which signifies the non-carcinogenic risk. The study highlights the occurrence of toxic metals in the indoor environments of Saudi Arabia and provides baseline data for future studies on these toxic metals in the region.

AB Coal plants represent one of the main sources of environmental pollution due to the combustion process of this mineral and the consequent release of gases and particles which, in significant quantities, can lead to a potential risk to health and the environment. The susceptibility of individuals to the genotoxic effects of coal mining can be modulated by genetic variations in the xenobiotic detoxification and DNA repair processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate if xenobiotic metabolism polymorphism, base excision repair polymorphisms and nonhomologous end joining repair polymorphism, could modify individual susceptibility to genomic instability and epigenetic alterations induced in workers by occupational exposure to coal. In this study, polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the polymorphic sites. The sample population comprising 70 coal mine workers and 71 workers non-exposed to coal. Our results demonstrated the effect of individual genotypes on different biomarkers evaluated. Significant decrease in % of global DNA methylation were observed in CYP1A1 Val/-exposed individuals compared to CYP1A1 Ile/Ile individuals. Coal workers who carried the XRCC4 Ile/Ile genotype showed decrease NBUD frequencies, while the XRCC4 Thr/- genotype was associated with decrease in Buccal micronucleus cells for the group not exposed. No influence of GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, GSTP1 Ile105Val, hOGG1 Ser326Cys, XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphisms was observed. Thus, the current study reinforces the importance of considering the effect of metabolizing and repair variant genotypes on the individual susceptibility to incorporate DNA damage, as these processes act in a coordinated manner to determine the final response to coal exposure.

AB This paper adopts a novel data-processing method of ECSA (R) based on TG/DSC-MS system to basically study the characteristics of release and conversion of fluorides and cyanides during heat treatment of the spent cathode carbon block (SCCB). All the experiments were conducted at 10 K.min(-1) heating rate and under Ar or Ar-O-2 atmospheres. The results indicate that the release of fluorides was just a steady but slow phase transition process under both Ar and Ar-O-2 atmospheres, which can be comparatively accelerated when the carbon material was burnt. The cyanides were effectively decomposed at high temperature and at Ar-O-2 atmosphere, with around three quarters of the cyanides being converted to the N-2 and nearly a quarter being to the NO. Finally, analysis on the flue gas composition indicates that it had a more complicated composition of CO2, N-2, NO, NO2, HCN under Ar-O-2 atmosphere but only had a composition of CO2 and NO under Ar atmosphere.

AB Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most toxic heavy metals that reduces crop productivity and is a threat to all the food chain including human health. Phytoremediation is an environmentally friendly strategy to clean up soil contaminated with heavy metals. Researchers are selecting new varieties with an enhanced capacity for phytoremediation purposes. Three Brassica rapa mutants for CAX1 transporter were obtained through TILLING. The objective of this work is to evaluate the tolerance of these mutants to Cd toxicity and its potential for Cd phytoremediation. For this, the mutants and the parental R-o-18 were grown under control and Cd toxicity conditions (100 mu M CdCl2) and growth, Cd accumulation and physiological parameters were analyzed. The results show that BraA.cax1a mutation provides greater Cd uptake capacity although only BraA.cax1a-12 would be useful for phytoremediation because it registered more than three-fold the Cd content of R-o-18 and presented greater Cd tolerance. This tolerance could be due to the higher Ca and Mg accumulations, the maintaining of photosynthesis performance, the enhanced ROS detoxification and AsA/GSH and TCA cycles, the higher malate, and GA4 concentrations and the lower ethylene levels. Briefly, this study identifies BraA.cax1a-12 as a potential mutant for phytoremediation of Cd contaminated soil and identifies possible physiological elements that contribute to this capacity.

AB The prevalence of microplastics in aquatic environments has raised concerns about their availability and risks to aquatic biota. Since fish is an important source of animal protein for human beings, the occurrence and potential impacts of microplastics in fishes deserve special attention. Although there have been an increasing number of studies concerning microplastics ingestion and effects in fish, review papers specifically focusing on this issue are few. This review summarized the current knowledge about the bioavailability and toxicity of microplastics to fish species. By collating literatures, it can be concluded that microplastics contamination could occur in almost all types of aquatic habitats around the globe. Both field and laboratory studies suggest that fishes are very susceptible to microplastics ingestion. Compared with marine species, freshwater fishes have been less studied. Microplastics alone or in combination with other contaminants could cause various health problems to fish after exposure. There still exist some debates over the environmental relevance of the laboratory-based effect studies and the relative contribution of microplastics in increasing the exposure of fish to hazardous chemicals. Hopefully, this review could extend the current knowledge on the ecotoxicological impacts of microplastics contamination to fish and provide guidance for future research.

AB Fast growing woody plants are proposed for potential application for phytoremediation of contaminated soil. In this study, the plant growth, physiological responses, mineral element uptake, and phytoremediation potential of the woody plant Morus alba L. were studied in different levels of Cd-contaminated soil through dynamic sampling (30, 60, 120, and 180 d). The results indicated that M. alba L. had strong physiological coordination, tolerance and detoxification capacity in response to Cd in contaminated soil. Compared with the control, the photosynthetic pigment content in M. alba L. leaves was significantly suppressed during initial cultivation (30-60 d) and the malonaldehyde (MDA) content and electrolyte leakage (EL) were increased from 30 to 120 d of cultivation. Furthermore, the uptake of Cu, Mn, and Zn in plant tissues was imbalanced throughout cultivation (30-180 d) under 55 mg.kg(-1) Cd stress. However, the chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoid, soluble protein, and soluble sugar contents and the peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities in plant leaves, as well as the uptake of macronutrients (K, Ca, and Mg) in plant stems and leaves were maintained at normal levels. Furthermore, the catalase (CAT) activities in plant leaves and the Ca and Mg contents in plant roots were significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced in response to Cd stress after 180 d of cultivation. Furthermore, the biomass of M. alba L. was significantly increased with cultivation time in Cd-contaminated soil. Therefore, normal photosynthesis, antioxidant protection, and macronutrient regulation contribute to M. alba L. with high tolerance to Cd. Moreover, the uptake and total extraction amount of Cd in aboveground M. alba L. were significantly (p < 0.05) increased with both the plant growth period and soil Cd level, and the maximum amount of Cd reached up to 340.5 mu g.plant(-1). Thus, M. alba L. can be regarded as a potential candidate for phytoremediation in Cd-contaminated sites.

AB Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms dominated by Microcystis frequently produce microcystins, a family of toxins capable of inflicting harm to pelagic and benthic freshwater invertebrates. Research on the effect of microcystins on invertebrates is inconclusive; from one perspective, studies suggest invertebrates can coexist in toxic blooms; however, studies have also measured negative food-associated effects from microcystins. To test the latter perspective, we examined the reproduction, growth, and survival of laboratory-cultured Ceriodaphnia dubia, Daphnia magna, and Hexagenia spp. exposed to cell-bound microcystins through a series of life-cycle bioassays. Test organisms were exposed to a concentration gradient ranging from 0.5 mu g L-1 to 300 mu g L-1 microcystins, which corresponds to values typically found in freshwaters during bloom season. Lethal concentrations in C. dubia (LC50 = 5.53 mu g L-1) and D. magna (LC50 = 85.72 mu g L-1) exposed to microcystins were among the lowest recorded to date, and reproductive effects were observed at concentrations as low as 2.5 mu g L-1. Length of D. magna was significantly impacted in microcystin treatments great than 2.5 mu g L-1. No lethality or growth impairments were observed in Hexagenia. This information will improve our understanding of the risks posed by microcystins to food webs in freshwaters.

AB A theoretical non-linear combined toxicity assessment method is proposed and evaluated using Microcystis aeruginosa as the test organism. The combined toxicity of binary heavy metals was evaluated by comparing the actual inhibitory rates shown from the experiments with the theoretically calculated inhibitory rates. It was identified that the binary mixtures of Cu2+ + Cd2+, Cu2+ + Cr3+ and Zn2+ + Cr3+ had the synergistic effects when the combined concentrations were low, but exhibited the antagonistic effects with the higher combined concentrations. Furthermore, the toxic effect of Pb2+ was not influenced by the addition of Cu2+ when combined concentration was low, but it was enhanced by Cu2+ at the high combined concentration. The binary mixtures of Zn-2 + Cd2+, Pb2+ + Cr3+, Pb-2 + Cd2+, Pb2+ + Zn2+, and Cr3+ + Cd2+ always presented antagonistic effects, while the synergistic toxicity effect on M. aeruginosa was observed for the binary mixtures of Cu2+ + Zn2+ regardless of combined concentration. The proposed assessment method was also validated by the antioxidant enzyme activity, which showed synergistic or antagonistic effects under different binary mixtures of heavy metals.

AB Chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflora) flowers are consumed as a popular, traditional herbal tea worldwide. During tea infusion with hot water pesticide residues in chrysanthemum flowers can be transferred into tea solution, posing potential health risks to consumers. Using greenhouse chrysanthemum this study systematically investigated the transfer of metalaxyl-M, fludioxonil, cyantraniliprole, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin (a major metabolite of thiamethoxam) from dry chrysanthemum flowers to tea solution at a range of infusion repetitions, duration and water temperature. The tested pesticides were released into tea solution at varying degrees, and the maximum transfer percentage was 59.9%, 9.8%, 29.4%, 88.2% and 68.4% for metalaxyl-M, fludioxonil, cyantraniliprole, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin, respectively. The transfer of pesticides into tea solution generally increased with increasing pesticide water solubility, water temperature, infusion duration, and pesticide concentrations in dry chrysanthemum flowers, but decreased with increasing octanol-water partition coefficient and the number of infusion repetitions. Risk quotient for pesticide intake via consuming tea solution of chrysanthemum flowers (one and two times of recommended pesticide dosages) ranged from < 0.00003 to 0.0924, indicating a low health risk. This study provides useful information for risk assessment of pesticide residues in greenhouse chrysanthemum flowers and may help establish realistic maximum residue limit of pesticides in chrysanthemum flowers and tea solution.

AB The use of algae is an effective approach to remove phenol and its derivatives from polluted water. The growth behavior, glucose consumption and phenol removal efficiency of Chlorella vulgaris under the synergistic effects of glucose and phenol were investigated. The evolutions of tolerance and removal efficiency of C. vulgaris to phenol under different trophic modes and glucose contents were observed. The results revealed that growth of C. vulgaris were inhibited with the increase of phenol from 0 to 400 mg L-1 in culture media; the tolerance to phenol enhanced with the addition of glucose from 2 to 10 g L-1 , while glucose consumption was inhibited with the increase of phenol content; phenol removal efficiency varied with glucose concentrations in mixotrophic media. The finding suggested that phenol inhibited the growth of C. vulgaris and glucose assimilation under mixotrophic cultivation, while appropriate glucose addition could enhance the tolerance of C. vulgaris to phenol and affect the phenol removal efficiency.

AB Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are a type of persistent organic pollutants that are widely distributed in multiple environmental media and organisms and have a teratogenic effect on and toxicity to animals and humans. The residual levels of seventeen PFAAs in the tissues of two regular consumption fish species, Culter erythropterus and Aristichthys nobilis in Lake Chaohu were measured by a high-performance liquid chromatograph - mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS). The distributions of PFAAs and the effect of the lipid contents were analyzed, and the health risks of typical PFAAs were evaluated. The results showed that perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) was the predominant contaminant (80.50 +/- 58.31 ng/g and 19.17 +/- 12.57 ng/g wet weight, ww), followed by perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (55.02 +/- 34.82 and 14.79 +/- 6.24 ng/g, ww) in both fish. The level of total PFAAs was the highest in the liver tissues of Culter erythropterus (359.87 ng/g, ww) and the lowest in the kidney tissues in A. nobilis (10.06 ng/g, ww). Due to the higher trophic level of C. erythropteru, the total PFAA concentrations were significantly higher in all tissues than those in A. nobilis. Liver muscle ratio of C. erythropteru was the highest, indicating the most accumulation in the liver. The concentrations of PFAAs in fish tissues were influenced by the lipid content, resulting in a difference between the lipid-normalized concentrations and the wet weight concentrations of the PFAAs. The non-carcinogenic risks of PFOS were higher than those of PFOA through the ingestion of C. erythropterus and A. nobilis. Both the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks of C. erythropterus were greater than those of A. nobilis, and fish tissue intake could cause an increasing of risks up to 60%, indicating that long-term and large amount ingestion of carnivorous fish and related tissues with higher trophic level, such as C. erythropterus should be avoided.

AB Photocatalytic membrane coupled to biodegradation offers potential for degrading volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in photocatalytic membrane biofilm reactor. An intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation reactor was operated in continuous operation for 500 days to treat simulated waste gas containing toluene. Toluene removal efficiency obtained 99%, with the elimination capacity of 550 g m(-3).h(-1). Membrane photocatalysis coupled to biodegradation was created to improve toluene removal from 11 to 20%. The dominant genera were Lysinibacillus, Hydrogenophctga, Pseudomonas at 30 d, Rudaea, Dongia, Litorilinea at 230 d xyl, Tod, Tcb, Bed, Tmo, Thu, Tou, Dmp, Cat were functional genes of toluene metabolism, as shown by16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing. Photocatalysis destroyed part of the toluene into biodegradable intermediates that were immediately mineralized by microorganisms in biofilm, some toluene was directly degraded by toluene degrading bacterial community into carbon dioxide and water. The novel hybrid photocatalytic membrane biofilm reactor is a cost-effective and robust alternative to VOCs treatment.

AB The occurrence of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) was for the first time investigated in various working microenvironments (internet cafes, electronics shops, coffee shops, restaurants, etc.) in Thessaloniki, Greece, using the dust trapped by central air conditioner (A/C) filters. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was found in the range from 16 to 227 ng g(-1), however it was detectable in only 30% of samples. On the contrary, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) was found in 85% of samples in the range from 3.6 to 72.5 ng g(-1), while 90-95% of samples exhibited perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDcA) and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) in the range from 10-653 ng g(-1), 3.2-7.4 ng g(-1) and 3.8-13.1 ng g(-1), respectively. The PFAS profile varied largely among the different microenvironment categories suggesting different sources. Estimated daily intakes through dust ingestion were calculated.

AB An increasing concern for Gemini surfactants (GS) based on the class alkanediyl-alpha-omega-bis (dimethylalkylammonium bromide) has been reported in ecotoxicological researchbecause of their estrogenic properties causing an alarm to aquatic life. In this study, we analyzed the toxic effects of the synthesized GS (12-2-12 and 16-2-16) leading to histological changes in fingerlings (kidney, gills, intestine, and liver) of Cirrhinusmrigala. Damage in the tissues in correlation with their normal architecture was observed microscopically and was manifold. The tissue-specific morphological alterations associated with somatic index (MAV-mean alteration value) were used as biomarker. The present study also highlighted the changes in the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). In order to estimate the sub-lethal toxic properties of GS, the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of GS were evaluated using blood smear assay and HeLa cell line respectively. Results of the study exhibited potential biotoxicity where GS with the highest hydrophobicity showed upper most toxicity level under different exposure time, while GS with less hydrophobic features exhibited least stressful regimeto the tested animal. The prepared GS were also examined for their biodegradability following the die-away method. The theoretical approach estimates the structural information by computational simulation.

AB The toxicity and environmental risk of chemicals, such as the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ), is commonly assessed using standardized laboratory tests and laboratory-to-field extrapolation. To investigate the toxicity of CBZ to aquatic key organisms in a more complex and environmentally relevant scenario, we conducted a 32-day multiple-stress experiment in artificial indoor streams. We exposed the non-biting midge Chironomus riparius, the blackworm Lumbriculus variegatus, and the New Zealand mud snail Potamopyrgus anti-podarum to 80 and 400 mu g CBZ/L in six artificial indoor streams. In addition to hydraulic stress, species' interaction, and low organic content in the sediment, organisms were co-exposed to the herbicide terbutryn (TBY) as a second chemical stressor at a concentration of 6 mu g/L. The exposure to CBZ under multiple stress conditions resulted in a 10- to more than 25-fold higher toxicity in C. riparius and P. antipodarum when compared to a previous, standardized laboratory experiment. The co-exposure to TBY enhanced the adverse effects of CBZ on snails (reduced production of embryos). This effect was additive as the single exposure to TBY also reduced the reproduction of snails, most likely through the reduction of biofilrn biomass. The emergence of C. riparius declined at a CBZ concentration of 400 mu g/L (without the co-exposure to TBY) and at 80 mu g/L in combination with TBY. The difference in sensitivity between laboratory and indoor stream experiments is indicative of a potential underestimation of risk when toxicity data are extrapolated to field conditions. The present results suggest the inclusion of non-chemical and chemical stressors in environmental hazard and risk assessments.

AB The effect of glyphosate, both pure and formulated (Roundup Ultramax (R)), was evaluated on males of the estuarine crab Neohelice granulata, by means of both in vivo and in vitro assays. The in vivo assays comprised the exposure for 30 d to 1 mg/L of the herbicide, until finally assessing weight gain, levels of energy reserves, sperm number per spermatophore, proportion of abnormal spermatophores, and sperm viability. At the end of this assay, significant (p < 0.05) decrease in weight gain and muscle protein levels was detected by effect of both pure and formulated glyphosate. In spermatophores from the vas deferens, a significant (p < 0.05) decrease of the sperm count was observed by effect of Roundup, while a significant incidence (p < 0.05) of abnormal spermatophores was observed either with glyphosate or with Roundup treatment. No changes were seen in the spermatophore area or in vas deferens secretions. Since no sperm mortality was induced by the formulated herbicide, we propose a probable inhibiting effect on spermatogenesis might explain the observed sperm count decrease. In this sense, an in vitro assay was designed by incubating testes and vasa deferentia with Roundup, in order to corroborate the possible interference of glyphosate with the secretion of the androgenic gland hormone that controls the spermatogenesis, in the presence or absence of the androgenic gland. Although the herbicide per se was able to reduce the sperm count to some extent, the increase in the number of spermatozoa/spermatophore produced by the co-incubation with the androgenic gland was completely reverted by the addition of Roundup (1 mg/L of glyphosate a.e.), suggesting that an inhibition on the secretion and/or transduction of the androgenic gland hormone could be taking place.

AB The effects of rhamnolipids (RLs) produced and further purified from Burkholderia thailandensis, on the unicellular microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta were investigated, in terms of RLs ability to affect algal growth, photosynthetic apparatus structure and energy flux, round and through photosystems II and I. Specifically, 24-48 h RLs-treated algae (RLs at concentrations ranged from 5 to 50 mg L-1) showed significantly decreased levels of growth rate, while increased levels of Chl a and b were obtained only in 72-96 h RLs-treated algae. Similarly, although no changes were obtained in the Chl a/b ratio and almost all chlorophyll fluorescence parameters over time, yields of electron transport (phi R-0, phi E-0) and respective performance index (PItotal) were negatively affected at 72 and 96 h. Based on those findings, it seems that the inhibitory effect of RLs on the algae growth rate after 24 and 48 h and the gradual attenuation of the phenomenon (after 72 h of exposure), may indicate the initial response of the organism, as well as algae ability to overcome, since Ills showed no effects on algae photosynthetic ability. Those findings reveal for the first time that RLs from Burkholderia thailandensis are not harmful for Dunaliella tertiolecta. However, further studies with the use of more aquatic species could be essential for assessing the RLs-mediated effects on aquatic biota.

AB Rivers represent the main source of mercury (Hg) in the Southern Baltic. Nevertheless, the concentration and proportion of individual Hg forms in rivers depend on the management of the river basin, as well as on the intensity of meteorological phenomena. Hence the aim of the present study was to determine the influence of drought and rains/intense rains on the content of labile and stable Hg forms in the soil of river catchments with various types of land management, and on the inflow of bioavailable mercury to the coastal zone of the sea. Soil and sediment samples were taken from two rivers flowing into Puck Bay (Southern Baltic): the Reda and Gizdepka. In order to determine Hg concentration and the proportions of its particular forms in the collected material, the thermo-desorption method was used. Five periods were identified during which the soil was enriched with various Hg forms. The obtained results showed that in periods of intensive development of vegetation, the soil becomes enriched with absorbed mercury (Hg-abs). On the other hand, as a result of Hg emissions during the heating of buildings, mercury associated with halides (Hg-ads1) is deposited on land, as was primarily recorded in catchments where individual household furnaces were found. Both mild and intense rainfalls intensified the surface run-off, which contributed to soil erosion, causing the transport of both Hg-abs, and Hg-ads1 to the river bed. However, the soil was more enriched with labile mercury in anthropogenic catchments, as they are only slightly overgrown with vegetation, the presence of which limits soil erosion. During periods of snow melting, there was intensive leaching and transportation of Hg-ads1, which had been deposited on the land surface during the intensive combustion of fossil fuels. In each of the designated periods, stable mercury sulphide was formed in the soil. However, the highest proportion of HgS was found during a period of drought, when organic matter decomposed and there was inflow of sulphur compounds from farms. Taking into consideration the anomalous study periods, the largest load of mercury introduced along with the bed sediment of the Gizdepka into the sea was recorded during downpour/flood. Nevertheless, the most bioavailable Hg-enriched load was introduced during snow melting period.

AB Methyl-triclosan (MTCS) is a dominant transformation product of triclosan (TCS), which has been widely used as an effective antimicrobial ingredient with increasing concentrations in the environment. MTCS shows higher persistence in environment than its parent chemical TCS. The toxic effects of MTCS and toxicological mechanism are not well understood up to now. This study investigated the cytotoxic effects of MTCS in HepG2 cells in terms of cell viability, apoptosis induction, ROS production, GSH/GSSG levels, Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP) reduction, LDH release, glucose uptake and ATP production. Moreover, the related gene transcripts were measured with RT-qPCR assay. Cytotoxic experiments in HepG2 cells revealed that MTCS exposure at micromol per liter levels had toxic effects as evidenced by decreased cell survival, elevated cell apoptosis, reduced MMP and increased LDH release. These toxic effects were associated with increased ROS production and reduced GSH/GSSG ratio. Meanwhile, elevated glucose uptake and ATP production indicated that MTCS induced membrane damages resulted not from a typical mitochondrial uncoupler, but from oxidative stress. Analysis of gene transcripts showed that MTCS exposure induced mRNA expressions alterations associated with oxidative stress response, energy production, cell cycle regulation and cell apoptosis. In general, the caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis pathway might play a role in MTCS induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells.

AB Tebuconazole (TEB) is a chiral triazole fungicide that is globally marketed and used as a racemic mixture to control plant pathogens. Due to its use as a racemic mixture, TEB may exhibit enantioselective toxicokinetics toward nontarget organisms, including humans. Therefore, the in vitro enantioselective metabolism of TED by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450) was studied using human liver microsomes, and the in vivo toxicokinetic parameters were predicted. A new enantioselective, reversed-phase LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated to analyze the enantiomers of TEB and its main metabolite, 1-hydroxytebuconazole (TEBOH). In vitro metabolic parameters were obtained, and in vitro-in vivo extrapolations were performed. Michaelis-Menten and atypical biphasic kinetic profiles were observed with a total intrinsic clearance ranging from 53 to 19 mL min(-1) mg(-1). The in vitro-in vivo extrapolation results showed that TEB first passage effect by the liver seems to be negligible, with hepatic clearance and extraction ratios ranging from 0.53 to 5.0 mL min(-1) kg(-1) and 2.7-25%, respectively. Preferential metabolism of (+)-TEB to rac-TEB and (-)-TEB was observed, with preferential production of (+)-TEBOH. Furthermore, reaction phenotyping studies revealed that, despite the low hepatic clearance in the first pass metabolism of TEB, multiple human CYP450 isoforms were involved in TEB metabolism when TEBOH enantiomers were generated, mainly CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, which makes TEB accumulation in the human body more difficult due to multiple metabolic pathways.

AB The present study focused on the bioaccumulation and cytotoxicities of Cd2+, CdSe quantum dots (QDs) and CdSe/ZnS QDs in Escherichia coli (E. coli, represents prokaryotic system) and Phanerochaete chrysosporium (P. chrysosporium, represents eukaryotic system), respectively. Two types of QDs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering. The inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer results showed that the bioaccumulation amounts of CdSe QDs by E. coli and P. chrysosporium were larger than those of CdSe/ZnS QDs due to the smaller particle size and less negative surface charges of CdSe QDs. Confocal microscopy and TEM results showed that there was an interaction between QDs and cells, and QDs have entered into the cells eventually, leading to the change of cell morphology. Plasma membrane fluidities and membrane H+-ATPase activities of E. coli and P. chrysosporium decreased gradually with the increasing concentrations of Cd2+, CdSe and CdSe/ZnS QDs. Results of the cell viabilities and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels indicated that the induced cytotoxicities were decreased as follows: CdSe QDs > CdSe/ZnS QDs > Cd2+. These findings suggested that the cytotoxicity of QDs was not only attributed to their heavy metal components, but also related to their nanosize effects which could induce particle-specific toxicity. The above results offer valuable information for exploring the cytotoxicity mechanism of QDs in prokaryote and eukaryote.

AB Atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) disproportionately affect human health across the globe, and differential exposure is believed to drive the unequal health burden. Therefore, this study assessed and compared the burden of disease, in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), at the same level (or limit) of exposure to atmospheric PAHs in nine countries. We calculated the DALYs per person-year per ng/m(3) of benzo[a]pyrene from ten cancers and thirty-four non-cancer adverse outcomes using published toxicity information and country specific disease severity. Exposure duration was averaged over 30 years and we adjusted for early-life vulnerability to cancer. The DALYs per person-year per ng/m(3) of fifteen other individual PAHs was calculated using relative potency factors, and toxicity factors derived from quantitative structure-activity relationships. We found that even at the same level of exposure to PAHs, the incremental burdens of disease varied substantially across countries. For instance, they varied by about 2-3 folds between Nigeria and the USA. Countries having the lowest longevity had the highest DALYs per person-year per ng/m(3) of each PAH. Kruskal-Wallis test (alpha = 0.05) showed that the variation across countries was significant. The post hoc tests detected a significant difference between two countries when the gap in longevity was > 10 years. This suggests that countries having very low average life expectancy require more stringent PAH limit. Linear or exponential function of average longevity gave valid approximation of the DALYs per person-year per ng/m(3) of benzo[a]pyrene or phenanthrene, respectively. Furthermore, we used global gridded surface benzo[a]pyrene concentrations and global population dataset for 2007, with spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees, to calculate the contribution of differential exposures to the estimated DALYs per person-year. We found that in six out of nine countries, differential exposures to PAH contribute less to the estimated health loss than differential severities of the diseases. This indicates that the risk to health from PAHs may be underreported if the seventies of the diseases in the countries are not considered.

AB An experiment was set up to determine the rate of dissipation of chlorantraniliprole (CTP) from two soils with contrasting properties. The other objective of the study was to find out the effect of CTP on soil microorganisms (population, microbial biomass carbon and soil enzymes) under controlled environment. CTP residues when applied at recommended dose ((RD) (at 40 g a.i./ha)) could not be recovered either from alluvial soil or red soil at 60 days post application of CTP in a microcosm study. Higher clay content led to higher half-life in alluvial soil compared to red soil. CTP could not be recovered from RD treatment at 30 days after pesticide application under controlled environment. Faster dissipation of CTP was observed in rice rhizosphere soil with 23.89 and 34.65 days dissipation half-lives for RD and double the recommended dose (DRD) treatments, respectively. Different doses of chlorantraniliprole did not have considerable negative effect on actinomycetes, fungi, biological nitrogen fixers and phospahte solubilising bacteria except the bacteria population. Among the treatments, DRD recorded the lowest activity of dehyrodeganse, fluoresein diacetate hydrolase, acid and alkaline phosphatases followed by RD treatment. Microbial biomass carbon, beta -lycosidase and urease did not vary significantly among the different doses of CTP. In general, RD did not have negative effcts on soil microbes. Hence, CTP can be recommeded in rice pest managment maintaining existing soil microbes and soil enzymes activity.

AB Past studies have already determined that selenium (Se) is very effective in alleviating cell oxidative damage caused by various abiotic stresses in plants. Past studies have also indicated other physiological pathways by which Se may benefit plants. In order to better understand the full array of potential applications for Se in agriculture, this study investigated the influence of Se on carbohydrate and nitrogen (N) metabolism in potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Sante) grown under cadmium (Cd) and/or arsenic (As) toxicity. Potato plants were grown in a growth chamber and fertigated with Hoagland nutrient solution with or without Se (9 mu M). After 48-d of growth under Cd (40 mu M) and/or As (40 mu M) stress, carbohydrate and N metabolism in leaves, roots and stolons were measured. For carbohydrate metabolism, various sugars i.e., sucrose, starch, glucose, fructose, and total soluble sugar contents (TSSC) and the activities of enzymes associated with sucrose metabolism and glycolysis i.e., acid invertase (AI), neutral invertase (NI), sucrose-synthetase (SS), sucrose phosphatesynthetase (SPS), fructokinase (FK), hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and pyruvatekinase (PK) were measured. For N metabolism, NO3-, NO2- and NH4+ contents along with the enzymatic activities of nitrate reductase (NRA), nitrite reductase (NiRA), glutamine-synthetase (GS), and glutamate-synthetase (GOGAT) were measured. Overall, Cd and/or As treatments had reduced plant growth relative to those plants grown without heavy metal toxicity, due to hindered photosynthesis and alterations in N metabolism and glycolysis. Regarding N metabolism, heavy metal toxicity caused a reduction in NO3- and NO2- content and NRA and NiRA enzymatic activity and enhanced NH4+ content and GDH activity in leaves, roots and stolons. Regarding glycolysis, the activity of enzymes of glycolysis i.e., FK, HK, PFK, and PK were also reduced. In the C metabolism study, plants combatted Cd and As toxicity naturally by an adaptation mechanism which caused an increase in soluble sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose) by increasing NI, SS and SSP enzymatic activity. Supplementation with Se in the Cd and/or As treatments in the carbohydrate and N metabolism studies improved plant growth. Selenium supplementation in the Cd and As treatments decreased Cd and/or As content in the plant tissue and alleviating the Cd- and/or As-induced toxicity by enhancing the C-metabolism adaptation mechanism. Applying Se to Cd and As treatments also decreased nitrogen losses by hindering Cd- and As-induced changes in the N-metabolism. Se also limited Cd and As accumulation in the plant tissue by the antagonistic effect between Cd/Se and As/Se in the roots. The results of this study indicate that in the presence of Cd and/or As. soil toxicity, Se may be a powerful tool for promoting plant growth.

AB Increasing levels of estrogenic pollution in marine environments has made the development of reliable biological detection techniques urgently needed. In this study, Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) lipovitellin (Lv) was purified and used to establish three immunological methods for the detection of vitellogenin (Vtg), a biomarker for environmental estrogens. Firstly, five different methods were employed to purify Lv, among which water-precipitation was the fastest and easiest way to purify Lv. Japanese flounder Lv was characterized as a phospholipoglycoprotein with a molecular weight of similar to 369 kDa. Using purified Lv and its specific polyclonal antibody, a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed. This assay had a working range from 7.8 to 250 ng/mL and a detection limit of 3.1 ng/mL. Furthermore, we developed an immunohistochemistry (IHC) and an immunofluorescence (IF) assay, both of which allowed visual detection of liver Vtg. Finally, Vtg induction in plasma and liver of juvenile Japanese flounders exposed to 17 beta-ethinylestradiol (EE2) was measured using these three methods. Exposure to 10 and 50 ng/L EE2 significantly increased plasma Vtg levels, and obvious positive fluorescence signals were observed near the liver sinusoidal vessels. These results confirmed that the methods developed effectively detected estrogenic activity of exogenous chemicals. Therefore, this study provides reliable methodologies for biomonitoring of estrogenic pollution in marine environments.

AB Agricultural activities pose a significant risk of groundwater pollution. Indeed, fertilizers and treated wastewater used for irrigation are, in part, responsible for the deterioration of groundwater and surface water quality. In some cases, soil may provide a protective barrier against this pollution, but this depends on the nature of the soil and the contaminant. This work presents the effect of the soil clay content on the retention of four different pollutants in order to evaluate the risk they represent for the groundwater. These contaminants are generated by two main agricultural activities: 1/soil fertilization with phosphate and nitrate fertilizers and 2/irrigation with treated wastewater in which heavy metals such as nickel and lead are persistent. Firstly, the characterization of the sand and clay used in this work was performed and showed a cation exchange capacity of 1.24 and 25 meq/100 g, a specific surface area of 0.12 and 67.98 m(2)/g and a percentage of organic matter of 0.15 and 2% for sand and clay, respectively. The retention isotherms on all pollutants and the Langmuir, Freundlich, Freundlich-Langmuir, Hill and Koble-Corrigan models were applied. All experimental isotherms have been successfully adjusted using the Koble-Corrigan expression. The amounts of nitrates, phosphates, nickel and lead retained by the sandy soil, for an initial pollutant concentration equal to 1 meq/L, were evaluated at 0.29, 3.89, 5.97 and 8.56 mu eq/g respectively. In contact with a soil containing 30% clay, the adsorbed amounts were estimated at 3.55, 15.00, 6.97 and 8.79 mu eq/g for nitrates, phosphates, nickel and lead, respectively. These results mean that the pollutants that pose the greatest risk of groundwater contamination when carried by water through sandy soil are classified as follows lead < nickel < phosphate < nitrate while for a clayey soil, the classification becomes as follows: phosphates < lead < nickel < nitrate.

AB As a heavy metal generally considered to be toxic, lead displays the destruction of the antioxidant system and causes oxidative damage through animal, cellular and molecular evidences. Selenium exists in the form of selenocysteine (Sec) upon its incorporation into selenoproteins and plays vital roles in protection from oxidative stress caused by toxic materials such as lead. This study investigated mechanisms of lead-induced changes of selenium status both at the animal and molecular levels. Total selenium concentrations in blood plasma, contents of glutathione peroxidase 3 (Gpx3) and selenoprotein P (SelP) in blood plasma and mRNA levels of key selenoproteins in mice livers were significantly inhibited after lead exposure, and indicators of oxidative damages in mice livers caused by lead also presented significantly higher, including levels of reactive oxygen species, malonaldehyde concentration and TNF-alpha levels. To further confirm the hypothesis that lead may disturb selenium status through affecting SelP function, we investigated molecular mechanisms of lead on SelP in vitro. Results indicated that lead changed secondary structure of SelP by loosening and destruction its skeleton. This work presents molecular mechanisms changes of selenium status in mice livers caused by lead combined in vivo and in vitro studies, and contributes to a better understanding of lead toxicity on human health.

AB Microbial adsorption of heavy metals has been attracted more interest in the recent years. However, there are very few studies in investigating the biosorption of heavy metals by Shewanella putrefaciens, which is a metal reducing bacterium. Firstly, the effects of contact time, pH value, temperature, biomass dosage and initial cadmium concentration on the cadmium adsorption by Shewanella putrefaciens were studied by single factor experiments. Then, the response surface methodology (RSM) based on Box-Behnken design was used to optimize the cadmium adsorption by Shewanella putrefaciens. The results showed that the empirical model was suitable for experimental data, and the maximum cadmium removal efficiency by Shewanella putrefaciens was 86.54% under the optimum conditions of contact time 4.0 days, pH value 5, initial cadmium concentration of 20 mg/L, which was further verified by experiments. In addition, scanning electron microscope - Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (SEM-EDS) analysis showed that the bacteria were seriously deformed, and a "bamboo" shape was observed on the surface which consisted of cadmium according to the EDS analysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis was used to evaluate the possible functional groups involving in interaction between cells and metal ions. The results showed that the distribution of cadmium on the cell surface was related to the carboxyl, amide, hydroxyl and phosphoric acid groups of Shewanella putrefaciens. These studies can provide a comprehensive understanding of the process and mechanism of microbial removal of heavy metals, and theoretical support for the follow-up practice of using biological adsorbents to remediate heavy metal contaminated soil.

AB Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) contained in electronic waste (e-waste) can be released to indoor environments and cause occupational health hazards during the recycling process. TVs, washing machines, refrigerators and printed wiring boar (PWB) represent the main domestic e-wastes. In this study, concentrations of Sigma 7PBDEs in air and dust samples from recycling workshops handling these four major types of e-wastes were measured, and the occupational exposure risk for workers at the corresponding workshops was evaluated. Concentrations of Sigma 7PBDEs in air and dust were within the ranges of 55.28-369.66 ng/m(3) and 158.07-669.81 mu g/g, respectively. The highest concentration of Sigma 7PBDEs in air was detected in the TV recycling workshop, while the refrigerator recycling workshop had the highest level of Sigma 7PBDEs in dust. The workers at these two e-waste recycling workshops were the most substantially exposed to BDE-209, which accounted for more than 85% of Sigma 7PBDEs in both air and dust. Compared to other e-waste recycling workshops, the workers at the PWB recycling workshop were also more exposed to BDE-47 and BDE-99. Occupational exposure levels for inhalation and dust ingestion were within the ranges of 3939 pg/kg/d to 26,271 pg/kg/d and 104,945 pg/kg/d to 444,694 pg/kg/d, respectively. The hazard quotient (HQ) values were calculated based on the RfDs provided by the EPA. Total HQ levels of inhalation exposure and dust ingestion were less than 0.222. The results of the HQ indicated that no adverse health effects were expected for workers in these workshops; however, the exposure risk of workers in the PWB recycling workshop (HQ = 0.222) was higher than that in other e-waste recycling workshops (HQ = 0.022-0.072). At the PWB recycling workshop, BDE-47 and BDE-99 caused the main occupational exposure risk to the workers, while s in the recycling plants handling other types of domestic e-waste BDE-209 was the major contributor to the risk faced by the workers.

AB Cholinesterases are frequent targets for toxic effects, namely by insecticides derived from phosphoric and carbamic acids. This effects allows the use of cholinesterase inhibition as a biomarker for contamination of aquatic environments by these specific chemical agents. However, cholinesterases are differently responsive to environmental contaminants, according to their different forms and locations. In addition, cholinesterases seem also to be inhibited by metals, so their use as an environmental criterion requires the prior characterization of their specific forms in each species and tissues, and the study of their sensitivity. The objective of this study was to characterize the cholinesterase isoenzymes present in the brain and dorsal muscle of three tropical fish species, namely Phalloceros harpagos (Lucinda, 2008), Ptetygoplichthys pardalis (Castelnau, 1855) and Astyanax altiparanae (Garutti and Britski, 2000). In vitro assays were conducted to quantify the effect of pesticides (dimethoate and carbaryl) and metals (lead and copper) on cholinesterases activity. Although acetylcholinesterase seems to be the most prevalent and abundant form, as commonly described in vertebrates, the here-obtained results showed that three cholinesterase isoenzymes occur in tissues of the three fish species. In addition, the pesticide carbaryl caused a stronger inhibition than dimethoate. Copper caused a significantly higher cholinesterasic inhibition than lead, which is also in line with most results concerning the anticholinesterasic effects by these metals. The here obtained results allowed to conclude that acetylcholinesterase is the predominant form in all tissues from the three analyzed species. In addition, cholinesterases of these three fish were responsive to common environmental contaminants, namely metals and pesticides, similarly to what was already described for fish of temperate areas. This allows using the here proposed fish species in environmental studies for the assessment of the presence of neurotoxicants under neotropical conditions.

AB Bisphenol S (BPS) has been introduced into the industry as a safer alternative to bisphenol A (BPA). The distribution of BPS has recently become an important issue worldwide, but investigations on the toxicity and mechanisms of BPS remain limited. A review of the literature reveals that BPS has widespread presence in environmental media, such as indoor dust, surface water, sediments, and sewage sludge. It has been detected in plants, paper products, some food items, and even in the human body. In addition, compared to BPA, BPS has a lower acute toxicity, similar or less endocrine disruption, similar neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity, and lower reproductive and developmental toxicity. The mechanisms underlying BPS toxicity may be related to the chemical properties of BPS in the human body, including interactions with estrogen receptors, and binding to DNA and some proteins, subsequently including exerting oxidative stress. However, further investigation on the potential risks of BPS to humans and its mechanisms of toxicity should be conducted to better understand and control the risks of such novel chemicals.

AB In this study, six alkyl esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acids (parabens) and their metabolite, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (p-HB) were simultaneously determined in surface water and sediment from the Yellow River and the Huai River in Henan Province, China. Concentrations of Sigma parabens in surface water were 3.31-55.2 ng/L in the Yellow River and 15.0-164 ng/L in the Huai River, while in the sediment, concentrations of Sigma parabens were 13.3-37.2 ng/g and 16.1-31.6 ng/g, respectively. Compared with other studies, levels of parabens in the studied area were relatively high in the sediments but middle in the surface water. MeP and PrP were the most abundant parabens, and were detected in all sampling sites. Contributions of EtP, BzP, BuP, and HeP to Sigma parabens were each no more than 10%. 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid was found in all samples albeit at low concentrations. Significant positive correlations among parabens suggest similar sources of parabens in the Yellow River and the HuaiRiver. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) had an important effect on parabens in the surface water of the Yellow and Huai Rivers. Due to low dilution of discharges, high concentrations of parabens were found during moderate precipitation season as well as minimal precipitation season in surface water. However, no apparent seasonal variation of parabens in surface sediment was observed. Hazard quotients showed that the ecological risks of parabens was low in the studied area.

AB Pesticides are proposed as one of the many causes for the global decline in reptile population. To understand the potential impact of alpha-cypermethrin (ACP) in reptiles, in the current study, we used a tri-trophic food web (plants - herbivores - natural enemies of predators) to examine the reproductive toxicity and biomarker changes. Based on the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) of ACP in several agricultural products, we designed three concentrations 0, 2 (MRL), and 20 mg/kg (wet) (weight) as three treatment groups for this research. Male and female lizards were fed ACP contaminated or uncontaminated diets for eight weeks during the breeding phase. The number of deaths was different among the three groups, and a dose-dependent trend was found. Decreases in food consumption of 26.6% and 28.1% were observed in the low- and high-dose group, respectively. Dietary exposure significantly induced a dose-dependent decrease in body mass index in lizards. Significant variations in glutathione-S-transferaseb activities, catalase activities, and malondialdehyde levels in gonads, suggest that lizards were under oxidative stress. In addition, ACP exposure altered sexual hormone levels in males, reduced reproductive output of females, and induced histopathological changes in testes. These negative effects highlight that ACP dietary exposure is a potential threat to lizards' reproduction.

AB An easily separated photocatalyst, magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes/cerium dioxide (MMWCNTs-CeO2) nanocomposite, has been successfully prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and subsequent loading of magnetic nanoparticles. The synthesized nanocomposite was characterized by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and vibrating sample magnetometer. The characterization results indicated the successful synthesis of MMWCNTs-CeO2 nanocomposite. Photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted to evaluate photocatalytic properties of MMWCNTs-CeO2 by using methylene blue (MB) as a model pollutant. After a light irradiation of two hours, relatively high degradation efficiency (97.5%) of MB was achieved by using MMWCNTs-CeO2 nanocomposite as photocatalyst in the presence of H2O2. The incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles could not only facilitate the separation of photocatalyst from the solution after treatment, but also enhance the photocatalytic degradation efficiency. The results of this study suggested that the synthesized MMWCNTs-CeO2 nanocomposite showed an attractive prospect for application in the treatment of organic wastewater.

AB Coptis chinensis Franch., is a widely used medicinal plant in China. This plant is often contaminated by cadmium (Cd) and render health risk to human consumers. Understanding distribution of Cd and its chemical forms is important to evaluate accumulation of the metal and its detoxification mechanisms in this plant. Since few studies have focused on this aspect, we used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to spatially locate Cd in rhizome cross-sections, and ICP-MS to analyze the Cd subcellular distribution and the chemical forms of Cd in different tissues. Rhizome bioimaging results showed that Cd was distributed predominantly within the periderm, cortex, pith, and root trace vascular bundle. The LA-ICP-MS results suggested that Ca2+ channels might be a pathway for Cd entry into the plant. Subcellular distribution data indicated that most of Cd was associated with the cell wall (41.8-77.1%) and the soluble fraction (14.4-52.7%) in all tissues. Analysis of chemical forms revealed that majority Cd existed in less mobile and less toxic forms in all tissues, and P could convert to insoluble phosphate with Cd to moderate Cd toxicity. The new understanding of Cd accumulation and detoxification might provide novel strategies for reducing the levels of Cd in C. chinensis Franch., thereby mitigating its potential transfer to humans and providing a theoretical basis for evaluating the Cd status in other medicinal plants. Further, our findings might provide a basis for establishing a reasonable Cd limit level of traditional Chinese medicinal materials.

AB Phenolic derivatives are compounds used in the production of pesticides, pharmaceutical products and several other industrial applications. These compounds are discharged into freshwater from industrial effluents, domestic sewage, urban and agricultural run-offs which leads to pollution. Water at six sampling locations along the course of Buffalo River; namely Buffalo river estuary (BRE), Mdantsane (MSN), Zwelitsha (ZW), King William's Town (KWT), Izele Town (IZ) and Maden dam (MD) in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, were evaluated for phenolic contamination using eleven phenolic derivatives of United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) priority pollutants. Samples were extracted using liquid-liquid extraction technique, derivatized with acetic anhydride and analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The levels of the individual pollutants in the river water were higher in summer (< LOD to 12246 ng/L) than in autumn (< LOD to 713 ng/L). Their concentrations were found higher than the USEPA recommended limit (500 ng/L) in most of the sampling sites. The most prominent pollutant was 2-NP. However, the cancer risk assessment values and hazard quotient were below USEPA maximum limits of 10(-6) and 1, respectively. Conclusively, the concentrations of these organic pollutants could be a threat to public health and should be managed to be below the recommended limit though the present levels are unlikely to cause cancer to both human and wildlife.

AB Eight recently isolated microalgal species from Northern Sweden and the culture collection strain Scenedesmus obliquus RISE (UTEX 417) were tested for their ability to remove 19 pharmaceuticals from growth medium upon cultivation in short light path, flat panel photobioreactors. While the growth of one algal species, Chlorella sorokiniana B1-1, was completely inhibited by the addition of pharmaceuticals, and the one of Scenedesmus sp. B2-2 was strongly inhibited, the other algal strains grew well and produced biomass.
   In general, lipophilic compounds were removed highly efficient from the culture medium by the microalgae ( > 70% in average within 2 days). The most lipophilic compounds Biperiden, Trihexyphenidyl, Clomipramine and Amitriptyline significantly accumulated in the biomass of most algal species, with a positive correlation between accumulation and their total biomass content. More persistent in the growth medium were hydrophilic compounds like Caffeine, Fluconazole, Trimetoprim, Codeine, Carbamazepin, Oxazepam and Tramadol, which were detected in amounts of above 60% in average after algal treatment.
   While Coelastrella sp. 3-4 and Coelastrum astroideum RW10 were most efficient to accumulate certain compounds in their biomass, two algae species, Chlorella vulgaris 13-1 and Chlorella saccharophila RNY, were not only highly efficient in removing all 19 pharmaceuticals from the growth medium within 12 days, at the same time only small amounts of these compounds accumulated in their biomass allowing its further use. Chlorella vulgaris 13-1 was able to remove most compounds within 6 days of growth, while Chlorella saccharophila RNY needed 8-10 days."Wild" Nordic microalgae therefore are able to remove active pharmaceutical ingredients, equally or more efficient than the investigated culture collection strain, thereby demonstrating their possible use in sustainable wastewater reclamation in Nordic conditions.

After removal of calcite, organic matter and Fe/Mn oxides, P adsorption onto the sediment residues was then evaluated through kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics. The sorption kinetic curves could be described by a two-compartment first order equation. The sorption isotherms fit well with the Langmuir and Freundlich equations. The HCl-treated sediments with calcite removed showed a rising fraction of the rapid step and a higher P adsorption potential compared with the un-extracted samples. For the clay minerals and silicate residue after NH2OH center dot HCl treatment, the rapid step fraction was dominant, the sorption capability was prohibited, and the process was much more reversible than the original and previously-generated samples. An increase of temperature was favorable for the sorption. Estimation of thermodynamic parameters showed that the process was spontaneous and endothermic, with an increased randomness at the solid liquid interface. Compared with the un-extracted sediment, the thermodynamic parameters in our case changed slightly after HCl treatment and NH2OH center dot HCl treatment.

AB Metallothioneins (MTs) are a super-family of ubiquitous, low-molecular-weight, cysteine-rich and metal-binding proteins. They are thought to play a predominant role in mediating metal metabolism and antioxidation. However, the accurate functions of MTs remain unclear in the physiological processes due to native proteins deficiency and little information of their metal-binding character. Freshwater crab Sinopotamon henanense is a decapod crustacean widely distributed in northern China, in which only one MT isoform (ShMT) has been reported so far. In order to shed light on the accurate role of ShMT, a novel recombinant ShMT in native form was over-expressed by phoA secreted expression system in Escherichia colt (E. coli). Then the ShMT proteins were purified using a one-step gentle immunoaffinity chromatography with a polyol-responsive mAb (PR-mAb) to ShMT, which was generated by conventional hybridoma technology followed by ELISA-elution. The Zn-, Cu-, and Cd-ShMT complexes were prepared by recombinant synthesis in metal-enriched media and reconstitution with metal ions, respectively. Further analysis about metal-binding capacity showed recombinant ShMT has high ability to bind Zn, Cu and Cd metals, although the recombinantly expressed and reconstituted metal-ShMT complexes have different metal-to-protein stoichiometry. Moreover, the affinity of recombinant protein for metal ions has been analyzed using competitive reaction with 5, 5-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). The results demonstrated the affinity of recombinant ShMT for metals was as follows: Cu > Cd > Zn. In summary, the experimental procedure we have developed facilitates production of recombinant ShMT with native characteristics for further research and the study of metal-binding ability could help further clarify the accurate functions of ShMT.

AB This study is the first to reveal that the iron-catalyzed photo-activation of persulfate (UV/PS/Fe2+ system) under mercury-free Kt-CI excilamp irradiation (222 nm) is capable of simultaneous degradation of an organic pollutant and inactivation of a microorganism in aqueous media using the herbicide atrazine (ATZ) and E. coli as model contaminants, respectively. Deionized water, natural water and wastewater effluents, contaminated with 4 mg/L ATZ and/or 10(5) CFU/mL E. coli, were sequentially treated by direct UV, UV/PS and UV/PS/Fe2+ processes. Lowering the pH to 3.5 accelerated both the degradation and inactivation during the UV/PS/Fe2+ treatment of natural water. Comparison of the apparent UV dose-based pseudo first-order rate constants showed the negative effect of E. coli on ATZ degradation by decreasing rates in all of the examined water matrices. This can be due to the competitive effect between ATZ and bacterial cells for reactive oxygen species (ROS). By contrast, E. coll. in the presence of ATZ was inactivated faster in natural water and wastewater (but not in deionized water), as compared to the case without ATZ. A scheme of possible synergistic inactivation under ROS exposure in water, containing ATZ, natural organic matter and chloride ions as primary constituents, was proposed. Radical scavenging experiments showed a major contribution of SO4 center dot(-) to ATZ degradation by UV/PS/Fe2+ treatment of deionized water and natural water. The UV doses, required for 90% removal of ATZ from natural water and wastewater, achieve 160 mJ/cm(2) (pH 5.5) and concurrently provide 99.99% E. coll. inactivation. These results make the UV/PS/Fe2+ system with narrow band UV light sources promising for simultaneous water treatment and disinfection.

AB As major precursors of disinfection by-products (DBPs), soluble microbial products (SMPs) generated by sewage discharge can adversely affect drinking water quality. It is essential to understand the adsorption behaviours of SMPs onto sediments and the effect of DBPs formation. In this study, the adsorption ability of sediments was evaluated by adsorption isotherms with respect to temperature and salinity. Adsorption behaviours were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron microscopy analysis, and excitation emission matrix fluorescence analysis. Chlorination was also employed to explore the influence of sediment adsorption on drinking water quality. The results indicated that the maximum adsorption potential of sediments to SMPs was 1.60 mg/g, which involved exothermic processes. SMPs adsorption declined with increasing temperature and salinity, and fulvic acid and protein in SMPs were more readily adsorbed on sediments than was humic acid. Correlation analysis results indicated that adsorption behaviours of sediments to SMPs could significantly reduce the generation potential of DBPs (r = 0.882-0.938, p < 0.01). In addition, the decrease of C-DBPs was considerably greater than that of N-DBPs. These research findings are of importance to assessments of the fate and transport of SMPs in water sediment systems, as well as the effect of following DBPs formation in the drinking water supply.

AB Background: Air pollutant exposure negatively affects human health; however, the molecular mechanisms causing disease remain largely unclear.
   Objectives: To explore the effects of respiratory particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure on the serum metabolome and to identify biomarkers for risk assessment of PM2.5 exposure.
   Methods: PM2.5 from Nanjing, China, was collected, and its water-soluble extract was subjected to component analysis. BALB/c mice received acute or prolonged exposure to insoluble PM2.5 particles or its water-soluble extract, and lung tissue was submitted to histopathological analyses. Serum samples were collected pre- and post-PM2.5 exposure and analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.
   Results: Component analysis revealed that metals and inorganic ions were the most abundant components in the soluble PM2.5 samples. Acute exposure to insoluble PM2.5 particles and prolonged exposure to the water-soluble PM2.5 extract both induced severe lung injury, and the lung histopathological scores were significantly associated with PM2.5 exposure. Metabolomics analysis showed that prolonged exposure to the water-soluble PM2.5 extract was associated with statistically significant metabolite changes; the serum concentrations of 30 known metabolites, including metabolites of phospholipids, amino acids and sphingolipids, differed significantly between the control and PM2.5 exposure group. Pathway analysis identified an association of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and the phospholipase metabolism pathway with PM2.5 exposure. The most influential metabolites for discriminating between the PM2.5-exposure group serum and the control serum were LysoPE, LysoPC, LGPC, citric acid, PAF C-18, NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta-Cer, Lyso-PAF C-16, ganglioside GA2, 1-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, PC and L-tryptophan.
   Conclusions: Respiratory exposure to water-soluble PM2.5 extract has developmental consequences affecting not only the respiratory system but also metabolism.

AB The main purpose of this research was to assess the level of contamination, source identification, geochemical fractionation, and health risk of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in industrial soils from urban and pen-urban areas of Ahvaz city. A total of 92 surface soil samples were gathered and concentrations of sixteen PTEs were measured using aqua regia digestion by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Possible sources of PTEs were quantitatively determined by positive matrix factorization (PMF) receptor model combined with geostatistical analyses and geochemical methods. The results showed that long-term industrial activities have enhanced the levels of some PTEs particularly Pb, Hg, Zn, Mo, Sb, Fe, Cu, and Cd to different extents. Contamination indices including geoaccumulation index, pollution index, and Nemerov integrated pollution index along with multivariate statistical analyses confirmed that steel and iron industries are the most contaminating industries in the study area. The outcomes attained from Kruskal-Wallis test affirmed that there was a significant difference among the concentrations of As, Hg, Mn, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mo, Cd, V, Zn, and Sb in soils around different industrial clusters. Among the studied elements, the highest mobility factors belonged to Zn (81.49%), Pb (76.71%), Cu (71.65%), Hg (66.23%), Mn (62.48%), and Mo (59.27%), respectively. Also, the PMF model showed that steel and iron industries (51.2%) and natural sources (23.4%) are the main sources of PTEs, followed by industrial towns (16.7%) and power plants (8.7%). This is in line with the results of principal component analysis (PCA). Majority of the measured PTEs showed the highest bioavailability in surface soils collected from around the steel and iron industries. Also, based on the outcomes of the health risk assessment model, particular attention should be paid to Hg, Pb, Zn, and Cu in industrial soils of Ahvaz.

AB The recent increase of freshwater eutrophication has favored cyanobacteria blooms and consequently the increase of toxins such as microcystin-LR in aquatic environments, but few is know about the associated effect of toxin and other compounds. Pyriproxyfen is an insecticide indicated by WHO (World Health Organization) to control Aedes aegypti mosquito (vector of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika diseases), however, the effects are not well described to non-target species, such as fish. The early life stages (ELS) of fish are more sensitive to chemical stress due to higher metabolic rate, immature immune system and high superficial area/volume ratio. In the current study, EIS of R. quelen a Neotropical fish were exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of microcystin (1, 10 and 100 mu g L-1 Ml, M2 and M3 groups, respectively) from an algal extract, pyriproxyfen (1 and 10 mu g L-1, P1 and P2) and their association (co-exposure). The hatching, survival and larvae deformities were analyzed, and applied a mathematical model to evaluate the effects on the population size along further generations. Both compounds were toxic to embryos/larvae of fish, but the effects were more pronounced in M2, P1M2 and P2M1 for hatching and M2, P1M2, P2M1 and P1 for survival. Deformities prevailed in groups exposed to the chemicals at 48 hpf (hours post-fertilization) were suggestions of toxicological interaction in P1M2, P2M1 and P2M2 at 48 and 72 hpf. In 96 hpf, the levels of deformities were lower than in previous times. Model predicted population density over 100 years decreased to lower than 0.5 (50%) in all groups, except for P1M1, indicating risk of extinction. P1M2 had the worse results, followed by M2, P1M3 and P2M1. Cyanobacterial blooms can lead to microcystin-LR levels higher than M2 (10 mu g L-1), and the suggestion of toxicological interaction with pyriproxyfen is relevant because both compounds may potentially coexist in aquatic environments. Finally, mathematical models may provide an ecological interpretation of the risk of exposure of fish.

AB The transgenic rice line T1C-19 provides high resistance to lepidopteran pests because of the synthesis of the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal protein Cry1C. It thus shows good prospect for commercial planting in China. Species of Cladocera, an order of aquatic arthropods commonly found in aquatic ecosystems such as rice paddies, might be exposed to the insecticidal protein released from Bt-transgenic rice-straw residues. For the study reported herein, we used Daphnia magna (water flea) as a representative of Cladocera to evaluate whether aquatic arthropods are adversely affected when exposed to Bt rice-straw leachates. We exposed D. magna to M4 medium containing various volume percentages of medium that had been incubated with TIC -19 rice straw or rice straw from its non-transformed near-isoline Minghui 63 (MH63) for 21 days. Compared with pure M4 medium (control), the fitness and developmental and reproduction parameters of D. magna decreased significantly when exposed to rice-straw leachates; conversely, no significant differences between the T1C-19 and MH63 rice-straw leachate treatments were observed, indicating that the Bt rice straw leachate did not adversely affect this non-target species.

AB Biochar materials originated from sewage sludge may contain elevated levels of potentially toxic elements. There was a lack of information on the mobility of biochar-borne elements, as driven by low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) contained in plant root exudates. A batch experiment was conducted to examine the effects of three common LMWOAs on the release of major elements and trace elements with a focus on various potentially toxic trace elements. The results showed that substantial amounts of Al, Mn, Fe, K, Na and Mg were extracted from two sewage sludge-derived biochar materials by the LMWOAs. A much higher release rate of potentially toxic trace elements was observed in the presence of LMWOAs, as compared to reported data using extractants not encountered in root exudates. The LMWOA-driven releasibility of various potentially toxic trace elements was in the following decreasing order: Zn > Ni > Pb > Cu > Cr > Co = Cd. Other trace elements that are subject to mobilization in the presence of LMWOAs included B, Ba, In, Li and Sr except Ba under oxalic acid extraction. Among the three LMWOAs, oxalic acid showed a generally stronger capacity to mobilize these metals. The findings obtained from this study provides new information that can be used for better evaluating the phyto-availability of trace elements bound to sewage sludge-originated biochar materials.

AB The behavior of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is influenced by environmental factors which altered their bioaccumulation and toxicity. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the influence of ionic strength on the ecotoxicity of AgNPs to Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) through the transfer from Escherichia coli (E. coli). Three different exposure media (deionized water, EPA water and KM) were used to pretreat AgNPs. E. coli was then exposed to these transformed AgNPs and fed to C. elegans. Our results indicated that ionic strength significantly enhanced the reproductive toxicity (germ cell corpses, brood size and lifespan) and neurotoxicity (head trash and body bend) of AgNPs in C. elegans. Moreover, ICP-MS analysis showed that higher ionic strength increased bioaccumulation of AgNPs in E. coli and the resulting Ag body burden of E. coli affected the transfer of AgNPs to C. elegans, which might be responsible for the increased toxicity to nematodes. Furthermore, we also found that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in C. elegans was significantly increased after exposed to E. coli contaminated with ionic strength-treated AgNPs, which might play another important role for the enhanced toxicity of AgNPs. Overall, this study showed that the bioavailability and potential ecotoxicity of AgNPs are associated with the environmental factors.

AB Hg contamination is a critical environmental problem, and its remediation using cost-effective and environmentally friendly methods is highly desirable. In this study, a multi-metal-resistant bacterium showing strong Hg(II) volatilization ability, Pseudomonas sp. DC-B1, was isolated from heavy metal-contaminated soils. DC-B1 volatilized 81.1%, 79.2% and 74.3% of the initial Hg(2+)from culture solutions with initial Hg(2+)concentrations of 5.1, 10.4, and 15.7 mg/L, respectively, within 24 h. Microcosm experiments were performed to investigate the remediation of Hg(II)-spiked soils inoculated with DC-B1 coupled with sawdust biochar amendment. The efficiency of Hg removal from two types of soil samples with different properties and an initial Hg(II) content of approximately 100 mg/kg was enhanced 5.7-13.1% by bio-augmentation with inoculation of the bacterial strain DC-B1, 5.4-10.7% by amendment of 4% (w/w) biochar, and 10.7-23.2% by the combination of DC-B1 and biochar amendments over an incubation period of 24 d over the efficiency in the control treatment under flooded conditions. Longer root lengths were observed in lettuce grown in the treated soils than in lettuce from the control soil, confirming the bioremediation efficacy of the two bioagents for soil Hg contamination.

AB Synthetic progestins are widely used pharmaceutical agents that have become common contaminants in the aquatic environment. The potential adverse effects of long-term exposure on aquatic wildlife, however, are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the endocrine disruption in Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) in response to megestrol acetate (MTA) exposure. Newly-hatched Chinese rare minnow larvae were exposed to MTA at a nominal concentration of either 1 ng/L (detected concentrations ranged from 0.18 to 0.93 ng/L) or 10 ng/L (detected concentrations ranged from 4.27 to 9.64 ng/L) for 6 months and the effects on growth, sex steroid hormones, gonadal histology, and steroidogenic genes expression were determined. After 6 months of exposure to a nominal concentration of 10 ng/L MTA, the body weight and condition factors were significantly increased in fish of both sexes. Exposure to a nominal concentration of 10 ng/L MTA significantly reduced plasma concentrations of estradiol and 11-ketotestosterone in female fish while also reducing testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone in male fish. Gonad histology revealed significantly reduced proportions of vitellogenic oocytes in female fish exposed to a nominal concentration of 10 ng/L MTA and induction of atretic follicles in female fish exposed to both nominal concentrations of MTA. The expression of cyp19a1a and cyp17a1 in the gonads was up-regulated in the ovaries while down-regulated in the testes. Our results indicate that MTA can induce endocrine disruption in Chinese rare minnow at the low concentrations found in contaminated environments. This indicates a potentially high ecological risk from MTA to fish populations in MTA-contaminated aquatic environments in China and may also in other regions.

AB Avoidance behavior of earthworms (Eisenia fetida) against six neonicotinoids (NEOs) (acetamiprid, dinotefuram, clothianidin, thiacloprid, nitenpyram, imidacloprid) was studied following the protocol of ISO. The results showed obvious avoidance behavior of E. fetida against the tested insecticides, and the medium effective concentration for avoidance behavior (EC50) of the six pesticides was 0.14, 0.55, 0.91, 7.87, 1.32 and 0.77 mg/kg, respectively. Compared to the acute toxicity, avoidance behavior was more sensitive as an indicator of soil contamination with NEOs. Chronic toxicity of above six NEOs to E. fetida was also evaluated; cocoon production, hatchability, cocoon weight and adult weight were all affected in the test. Cocoon production and hatchability were more sensitive than cocoon weight and adult weight. The reproduction of earthworms were significantly reduced with a 56 d half-maximal effective hatchability concentration (EC50) of 0.37, 0.74, 1.30, 3.57, 1.20 and 0.70 mg/kg (acetamiprid, dinotefuram, clothianidin, thiacloprid, nitenpyram, imidacloprid), respectively. Most of the tested NEOs were highly toxic to E. fetida. Avoidance behavior and reproduction damage of E. fetida was observed at very low concentrations. The existing levels of pollution with NEOs in soil frequently exceed the lowest observed adverse effect concentrations, which are likely to have negative biological and ecological impacts on earthworms.

AB Considering the high number of accidents with diesel oil spills occurring in the marine ecosystem, toxicity tests aimed at assessing the effects of this pollutant on biota are necessary and urgent. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the toxicity of the soluble fraction of diesel oil (WSD) in the fertilization success of gametes and pluteu larvae of the sea urchin Echinometra lucunter. To do this, gametes and embryos were exposed to concentrations of 0% (control group), 0.5%, 1.5% and 2.5% of WSD. The fertilization success of exposed gametes and embryos were reduced significantly when compared to the control group in all tested concentrations. With this finding, it is evident that diesel oil can be significantly promoted in the early and adult life stages of a particular organism, and a better way of evaluating this toxicity is through the analysis of contaminant effects throughout the reproductive cycle of a species.

AB Aluminum (Al)-toxicity and boron (B)-deficiency are two major factors limiting crop production in tropical and subtropical areas. Elevating B supply can alleviate the Al-induced inhibition of growth in Citrus grandis. Seedlings of C. grandis were irrigated for 18 weeks with nutrient solutions containing two B levels (2.5 and 20 mu M H3BO3 ) and two Al levels (0 and 1.2 mM AlCl(3 center dot)6H(2)O). By using 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) based MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS method, this study successfully identified and quantified sixty-one differentially abundant proteins in Citrus roots in response to B-Al interactions. The mechanisms underlying the B-induced alleviation of Al-toxicity unveiled by 2-DE technique could be summarized as follows: a) remodeling of cell wall by reducing the synthesis of lignin (sugar ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter ATPase and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase) and increasing the modification of cell wall (UDP-forming); b) enhancing the abundances of proteasomes and turnover of dysfunctional proteins (proteasome or protease); c) increasing the abundance of stress response proteins, such as alcohol dehydrogenase, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAMS) and glycosyl hydrolase; d) reinforcing cellular biological regulation and signal transduction (calreticulin-1). For the first time, some proteins, such as cell division protein 48 (CDC48), calreticulin and phospholipase, which might be involved in the downstream signaling of Al in Citrus plants, were successfully identified.

AB Blooms of Aureococcus anophagefferens, referred to as brown tides are responsible for massive mortalities and recruitment failure of some bivalves. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity remain elusive despite its biological significance, and the information currently available on the molecular effects is still insufficient. In this study, to evaluate the toxicity and associated mechanism of A. anophagefferens on bivalves, we analyzed the protein expression profiles in digestive glands of the A. anophagefferens-exposed Perna viridis by using iTRAQ. A total of 3138 proteins were identified in the digestive glands of A. anophagefferens-exposed P. viridis based on iTRAQ. Amongst, a repertoire of 236 proteins involved in cell, cell part, catalytic activity, metabolic process, biological regulation, immune system process, and response to stimulus were found to be differentially expressed. Functional analysis of the differentially expressed proteins demonstrated that innate immune system of P. viridis was activated, and some proteins associated with stress response and lipid metabolism were induced after exposure to A. anophagefferens. Additionally, MDA content, SOD activity and GSH-Px activity was increased significantly in the digestive gland of A. anophagefferens-exposed P. viridis. Taken together, our results indicated that the A. anophagefferens could induce oxidative stress, activate complement system and alter fat acid metabolism of P. viridis.

AB Ionic liquids (ILs) are widely used in various chemical processes. However, a growing number of studies have found that ILs are potentially toxic to different types of living organisms, including crops. The present study analysed the effects of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C-4 mim]Cl) on the photosynthetic system and metabolism of maize seedlings. Results showed that [C-4 mim]Cl could significantly reduce maize leaf chlorophyll level and cause extensive leaf bleaching. The activity of photosystem II (PSII) was significantly inhibited when seedlings exposed to higher concentration of [C-4 mim]Cl. The maximum quantum yield of PSII and the potential efficiency of PSII were reduced by 63% and 88% under 800 mg/L [C-4 mim]Cl treatment in comparison with the control treatment. The RNA sequencing analysis performed to examine gene expression profiles of maize leaves under [C-4 mim]Cl treatment revealed 639 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 115 of which were categorized into different metabolic pathways. Among these DEGs, the seven genes involved in the photosynthetic Calvin cycle were down-regulated by [C-4 mim]Cl exposure. For carbohydrates and amino acids metabolism, the genes for starch synthesis were down-regulated, while the genes for amino acids and protein degradation were up-regulated. The changes observed in these major metabolic pathways might be an important reason for [C-4 mim]Cl toxicity.

AB Hydrate formation in seafloor pipelines is considered an economic and flow assurance issue for the oil and gas industries. Ionic liquids (ILs) have been recently used as potential hydrate inhibitors. Although branded as green compounds, their ecotoxicity in case of leakage from pipelines onto the aquatic environment needs more deep evaluations. Here, we investigate the impacts of three ILs previously used as successful thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors namely choline chloride (ChC1), 1-methyl-1-propyl pyrrolidinium triflate (PMPy [triflate]) and tetramethyl ammonium acetate (TMAA). Mortality (including LC50), teratogenicity, locomotion and neurotoxicity, and hatching rate were utilized to investigate any potential acute toxicity of these ILs on embryonic development of zebrafish. No significant mortality or teratogenic effects were found for all tested compounds in a concentration range between 50 and 200 mg/L. The LC50 was significantly higher than the tested dose > 200 mg/L. While, up to 200 mg/L all compound had no impact on the survival rate, ChC1 showed a significant effect on neuromuscular development as judged by the increase of spontaneous tail coiling activity (25 VS 4 burst/minutes of the negative control-treated embryos). Further, apart from PMPy [triflate], ChC1 and TMAA had a significant adverse effect on the hatching rate of the treated embryos at concentrations of 200 mg/L. However, this effect was very mild at lower concentrations (<= 100 mg/L). Our data indicate that within the tested concentrations both TMAA and PMPy [triflate] had no or little potential harmful effect on embryonic development of aquatic fauna "green", while ChC1 should be used with caution.

AB Environmental contaminant exposure can pose significant risks to human health. Therefore, evaluating the impact of this exposure is of great importance; however, it is often difficult because both the molecular mechanism of disease and the mode of action of the contaminants are complex. We used network biology techniques to quantitatively assess the impact of environmental contaminants on the human interactome and diseases with a particular focus on seven major contaminant categories: persistent organic pollutants (POPs), dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, perfluorochemicals (PFCs), metals, and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). We integrated publicly available data on toxicogenomics, the diseasome, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and gene essentiality and found that a few contaminants were targeted to many genes, and a few genes were targeted by many contaminants. The contaminant targets were hub proteins in the human PPI network, whereas the target proteins in most categories did not contain abundant essential proteins. Generally, contaminant targets and disease-associated proteins were closely associated with the PPI network, and the closeness of the associations depended on the disease type and chemical category. Network biology techniques were used to identify environmental contaminants with broad effects on the human interactome and contaminant-sensitive biomarkers. Moreover, this method enabled us to quantify the relationship between environmental contaminants and human diseases, which was supported by epidemiological and experimental evidence. These methods and findings have facilitated the elucidation of the complex relationship between environmental exposure and adverse health outcomes.

At a concentration of 2 mg of endosulfan per kilogram of soil, both JW2 and NS had positive effects on the degradation of endosulfan; JW2 degraded 100% and 91.5% of alpha- and beta-endosulfan, respectively, and NS degraded 95.1% and 90.3% of alpha- and beta-endosulfan, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of soil samples showed the successful colonization of JW2 and NS, and the toxicity of the soil decreased, as determined by single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assays of Eiseniafetida and micronucleus (MN) assays of Viciafaba root tip cells. Furthermore, the metabolic products of the bacterially degraded endosulfan from the in situ experiments were identified as endosulfan ether and lactone. This study provided potentially foundational backgrounds information for the remediation of endosulfan-contaminated soil.

AB The present study investigated the toxic effects of parental (maternal/paternal) exposure to heavy fuel oil (HFO) on the adult reproductive state, gamete quality and development of the offspring of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius. Adult sea urchins were exposed to effluents from HFO-oiled gravel columns for 7 days to simulate an oil-contaminated gravel shore, and then gametes of adult sea urchins were used to produce embryos to determine developmental toxicity. For adult sea urchins, no significant difference in the somatic size and weight was found between the various oil loadings tested, while the gonad weight and gonad index were significantly decreased at higher oil loadings. The spawning ability of adults and fecundity of females significantly decreased. For gametes, no effect was observed on the egg size and fertilization success in any of the groups. However, a significant increase in the percentage of anomalies in the offspring was observed and then quantified by an integrative toxicity index (ITI) at 24 and 48 h post fertilization. The offspring from exposed parents showed higher ITI values with more malformed embryos. The results confirmed that parental exposure to HFO can cause adverse effects on the offspring and consequently affect the recruitment and population maintenance of sea urchins.

AB With the development of grain production technologies and improvement of rural living standard, the production and utilization of straw have significantly been changed in China. More than 1 billion tones of straw are produced per year, and vast amount of them are discarded without effective utilization, leading various environmental and social impacts. Straw return is an effective approach of the straw utilization that has been greatly recommended by government and scientists in China. This paper discussed the current status of the straw return in China. Specifically, the production and models of straw return were explored and their environmental impacts were extensively evaluated. It was concluded that straw could be positively effective on the improvement of the soil quality and the grain production. However, it appeared that the straw return also had several neglect negative effects, implying that further research and assessment on the returned straw are required before its large-scale promotion in China.

AB The effects of graphene oxide (GO) carbon nanomaterials on ecosystems have been well characterized, but the toxicity of GO at predicted environmental concentrations to living organisms at the protein level remain largely unknown. In the present work, the adverse effects and mechanisms of GO at predicted environmental concentrations were evaluated by integrating proteomics and standard analyses for the first time. The abundances of 243 proteins, including proteins involved in endocytosis (e.g., citcb, arf6, capzb and dnrnl a), oxidative stress (e.g., gpx4b, sod2, and prdx1), cytoskeleton assembly (e.g., krt8, krt94, biota and vim), mitochondrial function (e.g., ndufa10, ndufa8, cox5aa, and cox6b1), Ca2+ handling (e.g., atp1b2a, atp1b1a, atp6v0a1b and ncx4a) and cardiac function (e.g., tpm4a, 4:1712, tomi2a 1 and tnnt3b), were found to be notably altered in response to exposure 100 mu g/L GO. The results revealed that GO caused malformation and mortality, likely through the downregulation of proteins related to actin filaments and formation of the cytoskeleton, and induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial disorders by altering the levels of antioxidant enzymes and proteins associated with the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain. Exposure to GO also increased the heart rate of zebrafish larvae and induced pericardial edema, likely by changing the expression of proteins related to Ca2+ balance and cardiac function. This study provides new proteomic-level insights into GO toxicity against aquatic organisms, which will greatly benefit our understanding of the bio-safety of GO and its toxicity at predicted environmental concentrations.

AB The presence of endocrine-derived compounds in the environment occurs due to a myriad of human or industrial activity and can disrupt the endocrine system of animals, including fish. One important group of endocrine disruptors are the estrogens, such as 17-beta estradiol (E-2, estradiol). Estrogens are gonadal steroid hormones, able to be influential even in small concentrations. Here, we demonstrate that E-2 is linked to female' decisions made by an important coral reef species, the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus, during interactions with other reef fishes (known as clients). E-2 treatment in natural conditions interfered directly in the cooperative relationships, by increasing cleaners' willingness to interact with clients, providing greater amounts of physical contact to their fish partners. We discuss the meaning of the observed behavioural disruption produced by E-2, which by affecting a key species (cleaners) may produce a cascade impact in the aquatic ecosystem.

AB The Yellow River Delta (YRD) is a typical region where oil fields generally overlap cities and towns, leading to complex soil contamination from both the oil fields and human activities. To clarify the distribution, speciation, potential sources and health risk of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soils of border regions between oil fields and suburbs of the YRD, 138 soil samples (0-20 cm) were collected among 12 sampling sites located around oil wells with different extraction histories. The 16 priority control PAHs (16PAHs), as selected by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), were extracted via an accelerated solvent extraction and detected by GC-MS. The results showed that soils of the study area were generally polluted by the 16PAHs. Among these pollutions, chrysene and phenanthrene were the dominant components, and 4-ring PAHs were the most abundant. A typical temporal distribution pattern of the 16PAHs was revealed in soils from different sampling sites around oil wells with different exploitation histories. The concentrations of total 16PAHs and high-ring PAHs (HPAHs) both increased with the extraction time of the nearby oil wells. Individual PAH ratios and PCA method revealed that the 16PAHs in soil with newly developed oil wells were mainly from petroleum pollutants, whereas PAHs in soils around oil wells with a long exploitation history were probably from petroleum contamination; combustion of petroleum, fuel, and biomass; and degradation and migration of PAHs from petroleum. Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate the health risks of the 7 carcinogenic PAHs and 9 non carcinogenic PAHs in the study area. The results indicated that ingestion and dermal contact were the predominant pathways of exposure to PAH residues in soils. Both the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic burden of the 16PAHs in soils of the oil field increased significantly with exploitation time of nearby oil wells.

AB Studies have shown high levels of contamination of both metals and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in aquatic systems of the world renowned Kruger National Park, South Africa. With effects evident in top predators, including, unexplained Crocodylus niloticus deaths and organ level and histological changes in Hydrocynus vittruns. A suite of biomarkers reflecting exposure and were selected to evaluate biological responses of H. vittatus to anthropogenic stressors as well as to evaluate whether the chosen suite of biomarkers could successfully distinguish between the different pollution profiles present in the selected rivers. During this study a clear relationship was found between exposure to environmental contaminants and the concomitant responses of H. vittarns to these stressors. The ensuing biomarker responses indicated that there is a physiological attempt to deal with, and mitigate the deleterious effects that metals and OCPs may induce. In the Luvuvhu River there is a clear indication in H. vittatus of the stimulation of anti-oxidant protective mechanisms in response to internal OCP exposure. This is reflected by the increasing cytochrome P-450, superoxide dismutase, and more specifically reduced glutathione, which resulted in decreased lipid and protein breakdown (reflected in decreased lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl levels). Consequently H. vittatus populations of the Luvuvhu River are under greater cumulative stress and this is reflected in the lower energy budgets. Our results further show the integrated application value of the current suite of biomarkers in assessing responses of subtropical fish to metal and OCP exposure as the entire suite of biomarkers when used in conjunction were able to explain 100% of the variation in the data.

AB Background. Numerous studies have investigated prenatal air pollution and shown that air pollutants have adverse effect on birth outcomes. However, which trimester was the most sensitive and whether the effect was related to maternal age is still ambiguous.
   Objectives: This study aims to explore the association between maternal air pollution exposure during pregnancy and preterm birth, and if this relationship is modified by maternal age.
   Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we examine the causal relationship of prenatal exposure to air pollutants including particulate matters, which are less than 10 mu m (PM10), and ozone (O-3), which is one of the gaseous pollutants, on preterm birth by gestational age. A total of 6693 pregnant women were recruited from Wuxi Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital. The participants were dichotomized into child-bearing age group (< 35 years old) and advanced age group (> = 35 years old) in order to analyze the effect modification by maternal age. Logistic and linear regression models were performed to assess the risk for preterm birth (gestational age < 37 weeks) caused by prenatal air pollution exposure.
   Results: With adjustment for covariates, the highest level of PM10 exposure significantly increased the risk of preterm birth by 1.42-fold (95% CI: 1.10, 1.85) compared those with the lowest level in the second trimester. Trimester-specific PMio exposure was positively associated with gestational age, whereas O-3 exposure was associated with gestational age in the early pregnancy. When stratified by maternal age, PM10 exposure was significantly associated with an increased risk of preterm birth only in the advanced age group during pregnancy (OR:2.15, 95% CI: 1.13, 4.07). The results suggested that P-10 exposure associated with preterm birth was modified by advanced maternal age (OR (interaction) = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.02, 3.91, P (interaction) = 0.032).
   Conclusion: Prenatal air pollution exposure would increase risk of preterm birth and reduced gestational age. Thus, more attention should be paid to the effects of ambient air pollution exposure on preterm birth especially in pregnant women with advanced maternal age.

AB Microplastics sorption of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) was the core processes that cause negative effects to biota, and their influencing factors and related mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we explored the impacts of water extractable organic matter (WEOM), an important source of endogenous dissolved organic matter in mangrove sediment, on the sorption coefficients of typical parent, alkyl and N/O/S-containing poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by microplastics. The presence of L-WEOM (D) impeded the PAHs sorption as the coefficients (K-f) decreased to 10.17 (mu g/kg)/(mu g/L)(n) and to 8.39 (mu g/kg)/(mu g/L)(n) for fluorene (Flu) and 1-methyl-fluorene (1-M-Flu), respectively. The K-f exhibited good linear relationships with the aliphaticity of L-WEOM (p < 0.05) rather than the aromatic carbon/alkyl carbon content (p > 0.05). Under the presences of L-WEOM (D), (S) and (K), the lone pair electrons of N/O/S-containing PAHs was the dominant factor contributing to the obvious difference of the K-f values from the other groups. Moreover, the largest impact of L-WEOM (D) on the Flu sorption was in the case of PVC microplastics, while almost no effect was in the case of PS microplastics. The findings of our work may be helpful in improving our understanding of the role of WEOM on the sorption of PAHs to microplastics in the field mangrove sediment.

AB Thousands of safety-related studies have been published on bisphenol A (BPA), an ubiquitous environmental pollutant with estrogenic activity and many other potential biological effects. In recent years, BPA exposure has been shown to cause anovulation and infertility through irreversible alteration of the hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal axis in several organisms, including fish and mammals. Recently, the European Chemical Agency classified BPA as a "substance of very high concern" because of its endocrine-disrupting properties, which have serious effects on human health. Given the risk of exposure to BPA as a pollutant in the environment, food, and drinking water, the objective of our study was to assess the effects of this compound on the adeno-hypophysis by means of a histopathological and morphometric study of the gonadotroph cells. In addition, using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays, we analyzed the changes in the expression of Cyp19b (an aromatase gene). Zebrafish were randomly distributed into five groups: a control group and 4 treated groups which were exposed to different BPA concentrations (1, 10, 100 and 1000 mu g/L). The effects of the different doses on Cyp19b mRNA molecules followed a non-monotonic curve, with the 1 and 1000 mu g/L doses causing dramatic decreases in the number of Cyp19b transcripts while the doses of 10 and 100 mu g/L caused important increases. The consequences might be deregulation of gonadotropic hormones causing degeneration of gonadotropic cells, as observed in BPA treated animals. This is the first study in which the gonadotroph cells have been evaluated using histomorphological endpoints after BPA exposure in zebrafish.

AB In this study, a new method for the simultaneous quantitative determination of triclopyr and aminopyralid in forage grass, hay, and soil was developed and validated using gas chromatography coupled with electron capture detector (GC-ECD). In this method, a simple and maneuverable esterification reaction was applied to convert the two acidic herbicides into their ester form with methanol. The target compounds were extracted with 1% hydrochloric acid-acetonitrile, esterified, purified by florisil solid-phase extraction cartridge, and detected in a single run by the GC-ECD. The average recoveries using this method, at different fortified levels, ranged from 80% to 104% with intra-day and inter-day RSDs in the range of 1.2-10.8% and 3.3-10.3% for both the herbicides, respectively. The LODs were below 0.02 mg/kg while the LOQs were below 0.05 mg/kg, both of which were much lower than the maximum residue limits (Mills) of 25-700 mg/kg in pastures, as established by the USA (the code of federal regulations). The open field dissipation and residual analysis in pastures and soil were conducted with the commercial formulation at two locations. With time, both triclopyr and aminopyralid dissipated via first-order kinetics. In forage grass, both compounds degraded rapidly over the first 14- or 21-d period and at a slow rate over the remainder of experimental days. In soil, they degraded at a relatively slow rate, and dissipated steadily to below or close to the LOQ by 60-d post application. The half-lives of triclopyr were 1.4-1.8 d and 6.2-9.0 d and aminopyralid were 1.7-2.1 d and 8.2-10.6 d in terms of forage grass and soil, respectively. The terminal residue results indicated that on 7 d after the treatment, the residues of aminopyralid and triclopyr in forage grass and hay were lower than the MRLs set by the USA. This work can provide guidance on the reasonable use of these herbicides and also provide an analytical method for the determination of triclopyr and aminopyralid in pasture and soil.

AB The use of multiple biomarkers has been shown to be an efficient method for evaluating environmental contamination. In this work, we evaluate neurotoxic effects and the antioxidant system responses of the R. branneri collected in two streams of lower Iguazu River basin, relating them with different percentage of vegetation coverture, presence of pesticides and fall and winter seasons. The biological samples were collected in March and August of 2015, from two streams that belong to the lower Iguazu River basin (Brazil): the Manoel Gomes River and the Arquimedes Stream. Soil analyses were performed, and the results showed the presence of the following organophosphates in the Manoel Gomes River and the Arquimedes Stream: disulfoton, methyl parathion, and ronnel. The present study detected inhibition of cholinesterase activity in the brain and muscle of fish samples during the fall from the Manoel Gomes River and the Arquimedes Stream. In the Manoel Gomes River, elevated lipoperoxidation was also observed during the fall. It was observed that the increase or decrease of biomarkers was related to temporal variation and, possibly, to the exposure of animals to agrochemicals. Although the Manoel Gomes River and the Arquimedes Stream are located in regions with large areas of vegetation, the soil analyses show that agrochemical residues are able to reach these locations, which suggests that the fauna are in contact with oxidant and anti-cholinesterase agents during the fall, in addition to respond differently during each season.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) recently have been recognized to constitute a health risk for aquatic ecosystems. The major pathways of PhACs to enter the aquatic environment are excretion and discharge of effluents through sewage treatment plants (STPs). The occurrence, bioaccumulation and risk assessment of lipophilic PhACs, including erythromycin, ketoconazole, indomethacin, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, propranolol, carbamazepine, sertraline and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol were investigated in a river that receives effluents from STP. The results indicate that the PhACs were extensively existed in fish, sediment, suspended particulate matter (SPM), colloidal phase (5 kDa to 1 gm) and truly dissolved phase (< 5 kDa) water, with total concentration of ten PhACs (Sigma(10)PhACs) of ND-19.6 ng/g, 7.3-11.2 ng/g, 25.3-101.5 ng/g, 10.1-27.7 ng/L and 67.0-107.6 ng/L, respectively. The Sigma(10)PhACs for particulate and water samples collected from STP's outfall site were higher than those collected from upstream and downstream, indicating that the STP is an important PhACs source of river. However, the Sigma(10)PhACs in sediment showed no significant statistical differences in the sampling area, and which was 3.5-9.5 times lower than those in SPM samples. The colloidal phase contributed 2.5-28.5% of erythromycin, 5.8-45.6% of ketoconazole, 8.4-32.2% of indomethacin, 7.0-21.4% of diclofenac, 11.6-36.9% of gemfibrozil, 10.2-45.9% of bezafibrate, 5.9-16.8% of propranolol, 1.9-11.1% of carbamazepine and 1.1-23.8% of sertraline in the aquatic environment. This suggests that aquatic particulates (e.g., colloids and SPM) maybe an important carrier for PhACs in the aquatic system. In general, the Sigma(10)PhACs in the tissues of fish were in order as follows: kidney > brain > liver > gill > muscle. Based on truly dissolved concentrations of PhACs in the water, bioaccumulation factors were between 3.7 and 2727.3 in the fish tissues, sertraline exhibited bioaccumulation potential. In all the risk assessments, erythromycin could cause most harmful adverse health effects for the most sensitive algae group based on the acute and chronic data. In addition, the risk quotient values for diclofenac toward fish were higher than 1. These results indicate that the PhACs pose a potential risk to the aquatic organisms, especially for chronic risk.

AB The use of free range animals for monitoring environmental health offers opportunities to detect exposure and assess the toxicological effects of pollutants in terrestrial ecosystems. Potential human health risk of dietary intake of metals and metalloid via consumption of offal and muscle of free range chicken, cattle and goats by the urban population in Benin City was evaluated. Muscle, gizzard, liver and kidney samples were analyzed for Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb concentrations using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) while Hg was determined using Hg analyzer. Mean concentrations of metals (mg/kg ww) varied significantly depending upon the tissues and animal species. Human health risk estimations for children and adults showed estimated daily intake (EDI) values of tissues below oral reference dose (RfD) threshold for non essential metals Cd, As, Pb and Hg thus strongly indicating no possible health risk via consumption of animal based food. Calculated Hazard quotient (THQ) was less than 1 (< 1) for all the metals analyzed for both adult and children. However, Cd and As had the highest value of THQ suggestive of possible health risk associated with continuous consumption of Cd and As contaminated animal based foods. Hazard Index (HI) for additive effect of metals was higher in chicken liver and gizzard for children and chicken liver for adults. Thus, HI indicated that chicken liver and gizzard may contribute significantly to adult and children dietary exposure to heavy metals. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed a clear species difference in metal accumulation between chickens and the ruminants. This study provides baseline data for future studies and also valuable evidence of anthropogenic impacts necessary to initiate national and international policies for control of heavy metal and metalloid content in food items.

AB Soil contamination with metals is a widespread problem posing risks to humans and ecosystems. Metal contaminated soils often hold poor microbial density and biodiversity. Among soil bacteria, rhizobia have a great agronomic and environmental significance and are major contributors to a sustainable maintenance of soil fertility. This group of microorganisms are severely affected by metals, such as cadmium (Cd), but information about metal resistance mechanisms in rhizobia is still limited. A concerted approach of the different mechanisms conferring Cd tolerance to rhizobia was conducted using two Rhizobium strains with contrasting tolerances to Cd. Results show that both strains resort to the same mechanisms (extracellular immobilization, periplasmic allocation, cytoplasmic sequestration and biotransformation of toxic products) to overcome stress, but differences in the efficiencies of some mechanisms were noticed. The ability of Rhizobium to increase glutathione in the presence of Cd emerges as a central factor in the tolerance to Cd and is as a feature to be looked for when screening or transforming microorganisms to integrate plant-microbe consortia. These could promote plant growth at contaminated sites, being more efficient for the cleanup of metals from contaminated sites and the restoration of soil quality.

AB The dihydroxybenzenes are widely found in wastewater and usually more than one of these aromatic compounds co-exist as pollutants of water resources. The current study investigated and compared the removal efficiency of hydroquinone, catechol and resorcinol in binary substrate systems under saline conditions by Penicillium chrysogenum var. halophenolicum, to clarify the potential of this fungal strain to degrade these aromatic compounds. Since P. chrysogenum is a known penicillin producer, biosynthetic penicillin genes were examined and antibiotic was quantified in mono and binary dihydroxybenzene systems to elucidate the carbon flux of dihydroxybenzenes metabolism in the P. chrysogenum var. halophenolicum to the secondary metabolism. In binary substrate systems, the three assayed dihydroxybenzene compounds were found to be co-metabolized by fungal strain. The fungal strain preferentially degraded hydroquinone and catechol. Resorcinol was degraded slower and supports higher antibiotic titers than either catechol or hydroquinone. Dihydroxybenzenes were faster removed in mixtures compared to mono substrate systems, except for the case of hydroquinone. In this context, the expression of penicillin biosynthetic gene cluster was not related to the removal of dihydroxybenzenes. Penicillin production was triggered simultaneously or after dihydroxybenzene degradation, but penicillin yields, under these conditions, did not compromise dihydroxybenzene biological treatment. To investigate the decrease in dihydroxybenzenes toxicity due to the fungal activity, viability tests with human colon cancer cells (HCT116) and DNA damage by alkaline comet assays were performed. For all the conditions assays, a decrease in saline medium toxicity was observed, indicating its potential as detoxification agent.

AB Improvements in plant physiological performance by means of biochar application in soils contaminated by multi-elements are determinants of agroecosystem functioning. This study analyzed the effects of bamboo-derived biochar on root nodulation and plant growth in a moderately acidic Andosol (pH = 5.56) contaminated with multi-elements during a 70-day investigation of soybean growth.
   Bamboo biochar that had been pyrolyzed at a temperature below 500 degrees C was applied to soils at three different and moderately high rates (5%, 10%, and 15%, w/w). Biochar amendment beyond 5% stimulated root nodulation as well as soybean growth. The nodule weight per root system was significantly enhanced by 186% and 243% over the control at the 10% and 15% addition rates, respectively. The primary explanation for these stimulatory effects was attributed to an increase in the K and Mo supplies for plant uptake that was induced by the biochar application, whereas the increased availability of P contributed to a lesser extent. Leaf CO2 assimilation rate was slightly enhanced at the highest application rate, but this enhancement was not associated with an increase in biomass. The incorporation of biochar into the soil reduced extractable-NH4NO3 Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn, but not Pb, regardless of the application dose. This change was accompanied by a significant (P < 0.05) suppression of the uptake od trace elements in soybean shoots at the optimum application rate (10%); the degree of reduction followed this order: Pb > Mn > Cd > Zn > Cu > Ni. The increase in soil pH and the diffusion/ adsorption of trace elements onto the biochar may have contributed to the lowering of the concentration of trace elements in the soil as well as in soybean shoots.

AB There is a growing global concern about the health implications of xenobiotics, which have harmful effects to both humans and wildlife. Among them, teleost fish are known as very sensitive to anthropogenic impacts, and are often being used as sentinel species in the aquatic environment. Xenobiotic molecules can alter the physiological homeostasis of fish and trigger an oxidative stress through overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suppressing the antioxidant system (AS) activity. An overwhelming generation of ROS is usually accompanied by damage to lipids, proteins and DNA structure, which can be associated with mutations, chromosomal aberrations and carcinogenesis. In particular, more attention has been paid lately to transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation by several genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) related to AS after xenobiotic exposure in fish. Revealing these molecular mechanisms will help better understanding the processes of detoxification of xenobiotics and resistance to stress, and can also provide valuable information for estimating risk assessment of environmental pollution.

AB Epidemiological studies indicate that living in proximity to coal mines is correlated with numerous diseases including cancer, and that exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 components could be associated with this phenomenon. However, the understanding of the mechanisms by which PM exerts its adverse effects is still incomplete and comes mainly from studies in occupationally exposed populations. The aims of this study were to: (1) evaluate DNA damage in lymphocytes assessing the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay (CBMN-cyt) parameters; (2) identify aneugenic or clastogenic effects in lymphocytes of exposed populations using CREST immunostaining for micronuclei; (3) evaluate multi-elemental composition of atmospheric particulate matter; and (4) verify relation between the DNA damage and PM2.5 and PM10 levels around the mining area. Analysis revealed a significant increase in micronuclei frequency in binucleated (MNBN) and mononucleated (MNMONO) cells of individuals with residential proximity to open-pit coal mines compared to residents from non-mining areas. Correlation analysis demonstrated a highly significant association between PM2.5 levels, MNBN frequencies and CREST+ micronuclei induction in exposed residents. These results suggest that PM2.5 fraction generated in coal mining activities may induce whole chromosome loss (aneuploidy) preferentially, although there are also chromosome breaks. Analysis of the chemical composition of PM2.5 by PIXE demonstrated that Si, S, K and Cr concentrations varied significantly between coal mining and reference areas. Enrichment factor values (EF) showed that S, Cr and Cu were highly enriched in the coal mining areas. Compared to reference area, mining regions had also higher concentrations of extractable organic matter (EOM) related to nonpolar and polar compounds. Our results demonstrate that PM2.5 fraction represents the most important health risk for residents living near open-pit mines, underscoring the need for incorporation of ambient air standards based on PM2.5 measures in coal mining areas.

AB Forty nine sediment samples were collected [Upstream section: Zahuapan River (1-12) and Atoyac River (13-20); Confluence Zone (21-31); Valsequillo dam (32-49)] to investigate the geochemical sources, enrichment, contamination and ecological risks of metals in the fluvial sediments of Atoyac River basin, an area experiencing tremendous urban and industrial development in Central Mexico. The sediments were analyzed for 23 major (Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, Na, K, P, S & Ti) and trace (Ba, Mn, As, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sc, Sr, V, Zn & Zr) acid leachable metals (ALMs). The grain size results revealed that the sand fraction of sediments accounts for 53.1% and silt for 46.9% respectively. The concentration pattern (avg. values) shows a spatial distribution of metals in the four zones indicating that S (0.10; 0.13; 0.34; 0.80 in %), Ca (0.96; 0.73; 4.98; 1.85 in %), P (0.05; 0.05; 0.16; 0.08 in %), Cr (122; 182; 111; 104 in mu g g(-1)) Mo (5; 9; 6; 10 in mu g g(-1)), Cu (13; 14; 53; 29 in mu g g(-1)), Ni (19; 22; 29; 46 in mu g g(-1)), Pb (9; 12; 21; 14 in mu g g(-1) Zn (92; 62; 204; 92 in mu g g(-1)) & As (2.63; 2; 3.35; 4.49 mu g g(-1)) exceeded the local background values primarily attributed to the natural volcanic inputs. Geochemical indices such as enrichment factor (EF), geoaccumulation index (I-geo) and pollution load index (PLI) were used to assess the degree of metal enrichment and the results revealed significant external influences over some metals (As, Cu, Pb and Zn). The calculation of potential ecological hazards index showed that among 23 tested metals, As, Pb, Cu, Ni and Cr were the main potential risk factors that will cause harmful biological effects in the riverine environment. A new complementary approach which integrates metal contamination, enrichment and ecological risks aided in more accurate determination of metal sources and their environmental impacts. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed the groupings of elements as lithogenic (Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, Na, K, P, S, Ti, Ba, Mn, Co, Cr, Ni, Sc, Sr, V & Zr) and extemal (Cu, Pb, Zn, Mo & As) suggesting that the metal sources are from volcanic events, natural weathering processes and the industrial influences from the Puebla City.

AB Aluminum (Al) is a neumtoxicant agent implicated in several behavioral, neuropathological and neurochemical changes associated with cognitive impairments. Nevertheless, mechanisms of damage and safety concentrations are still very discussed. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to investigate whether two aluminum low doses were able to produce deleterious effects on cognition of adult rats, including oxidative stress in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, two important areas for cognition. For this, thirty adult Wistar rats were divided into three groups: Al1 (8.3 mg/kg/day), Al2 (32 mg/kg/day) and Control (Ultrapure Water), in which all three groups received their solutions containing or not AlCl3 by intragastric gavage for 60 days. After the experimental period, the short- and long-term memories were assessed by the object recognition test and step-down inhibitory avoidance. After euthanizing, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus samples were dissected for Al levels measurement and evaluation of oxidative biochemistry. Only Al2 increased Al levels in hippocampal parenchyma significantly; both concentrations did not impair short-term memory, while long-term memory was affected in Al1 and Al2. In addition, oxidative stress was observed in prefrontal and hippocampus in Al1 and Al2. Our results indicate that, in a translational perspective, humans are subjected to deleterious effects of Al over cognition even when exposed to low concentrations, by triggering oxidative stress and poor long-term memory performance.

AB Seaweed is an inherently important entity in marine ecosystems. It is not only consumed by aquatic animals but also improves environmental quality in the mariculture. Seaweed is also part of the diet of human beings. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the antagonism of selenium (Se)-enriched Gracilaria lemaneiformis against heavy metals, specifically, the potential of dietary Se-enriched Gracilaria to protect against heavy metal toxicity in rabbitfish (Siganus oramin). Growth rate, heavy metal (Se, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn and Cr) concentrations, malondialdehyde (MDA), metallothionein (MT), and the activity of the antioxidants, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were all assessed. The results showed that the total organic and inorganic Se concentration for the 250 mg L-1 Se-enriched Gracilaria was significantly higher than those of the 50 and 10 mg L-1 treatments after 3 days of enrichment. The mean total Se concentrations in Gracilaria were 42.5 mu g g(-1)- in the 250 mg L-1 treatment, 13.5 mu g g(-1)- in the 50 mg L-1 treatment and 2.5 mu g g(-1) in the 10 mg L-1 treatment, respectively. Organic Se accounts for 80-82% of total Se in Se-enriched Gracilaria. The Se concentration of rabbitfish fed Se-enriched Gracilaria was significantly higher than control. Furthermore, Se increased Cu and Zn absorption, and enhanced MT generation, and improved GPX, CAT, and SOD antioxidant activity, and decreased MDA concentrations and lipid pemxidation levels, all antagonistic to Cd, Pb and Cr. The effects of Se-enriched Gracilaria on waterborne Cd, Pb and Cr-induced toxicity occurred via both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidative mechanisms in rabbitfish. Selenium had synergistic effects on Zn and Cu in rabbitfish. For the 50 mg L-1 Se-enriched Gracilaria treatment, the Se, Cu, Zn, and antagonistic Cd, Pb, Cr, and the antioxidant enzymes CAT, SOD, GPX activities, and MT concentrations in rabbitfish were higher than that with the 250 mg L-1 and 10 mg L-1 Se-enriched Gracilaria treatments. The 50 mg L-1 Se treatment of Gracilaria was deemed to be the optimum concentration to promote growth of rabbitfish. Therefore, the obtained results suggest Se-enriched Gracilaria can antagonize heavy metal toxicity, and is an advisable Se supplement to improve the edible safety of cultured animals.

AB ZIF-8 nanoparticles (NPs) has been demonstrated with good potential in drug delivery, which causes an increasing attention on relevant toxicity study. In this work, MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), stain analysis and gene detection assays were performed on ZIF-8 (50, 90 and 200 nm) incubated HepG2 cells. Moreover, time-resolved inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (TRA-ICP-MS) was applied for single cell analysis; the variation in cellular zinc amount and the proportion of zinc up-taken cells was investigated as a function of NPs size, incubation concentration/time and elimination. Smaller size of ZIF-8 NPs would lead to higher zinc accumulation and toxicity. The function of ZIF-8 on cells is assumed to be mainly related to zinc intracellular accumulation. The possible action path is presented as high accumulation of zinc in ZIF-8 incubated cells lead to high ROS level and cellular inflammation, ultimately inducing necrocytosis. For better understanding of the bio-effect of ZIF-8, ZnO NPs and Zn2+ incubated HepG2 cells were evaluated in the same way. Higher accumulation of zinc in larger part of the cell population was found in ZIF-8 incubated cells than that in ZnO NPs incubated cells. It demonstrated higher bioavailability for ZIF-8 over ZnO NPs. While, in drug delivery application, the possible risk of the remained intracellular ZIF-8 cannot be ignored.

AB Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is one of the most frequently used pesticide in extensive agriculture around the world and can be incorporated by humans and animals with possible consequences on health. The effects of this pesticide on carcinogenesis are not clear and there is no consensus concerning the risks of this compound. In previous work, we demonstrated that CPF induces proliferation of breast cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. In this work we investigate whether CPF promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer cells. Herein, we demonstrate that 50 mu M CFP induces invasion in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, 0.05 and 50 mu M CPF increases migration in both cell lines. In MCF-7 cells, 0.05 and 50 mu M CPF increase the metalloprotease MMP2 expression and decrease E-Cadherin and beta-Catenin expression diminishing their membrane location. Furthermore, 50 mu M CPF induces Vimentin expression and Slug nuclear translocation in MCF-7 cells. 0.05 and 50 mu M CPF increase MMP2 gelatinolytic activity and expression, decrease p-Catenin expression and increase Vimentin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells.
   Inhibition of the oncoprotein c-Src reverses all the effects induced by CPF in MDA-MB-231 but not in MCF-7 indicating that c-Src is a kinase with a crucial role in the cells which grow in an estrogen-independent way. In MCF-7 cells both c-Src and estrogen receptor alpha must be blocked to completly inhibit the CPF-mediated effects. Our results show for the first time that the exposure to subthreshold concentrations of CPF promotes the modulation of EMT-molecular markers and pathways. These results, together with the ubiquitous distribution of the pesticide CPF, make it of utmost importance to take measures to minimize the risk of exposure to this compound.

AB The production of natural selenium (Se)-rich food by using a high-Se crop cultivar is beneficial to human health and environmental safety; however, the underlying mechanism of different Se-accumulation ability between high- and low-Se rice cultivars remains unclear. A low-grain-Se cultivar and high-grain-Se cultivar of rice were used as test materials, and two levels of Se (0 and 0.5 mg kg(-1)) were arranged in a randomized design containing twelve replicates. The dynamic changes of shoot Se concentration and accumulation, xylem sap Se concentration, shoot and grain Se distribution, Se transporters genes (OsPT2, Sultr1;2, NRT1.1B) expression of the high- and low-Se rice cultivars were determined. The shoot Se concentration and accumulation of the high-Se rice showed a greater degree of reduction than those of the low-Se rice during grain filling stage, indicating that leaves of high-Se rice served as a Se source and supplied more Se for the growth centre grain. The expression levels of OsPT2, NRT1.1B and Sultr1;2 in the high-Se rice cultivar were significantly higher than those in the low-Se rice cultivar, which indicated that the high-Se rice cultivar possessed better transport carriers. The distribution of Se in grain of the high-Se rice cultivar was more uniform, whereas the low-Se cultivar tended to accumulate Se in embryo end. The stronger reutilization of Se from shoots to grains promoted by increased transporters genes expression and optimized grain storage space may explain how the high-Se rice cultivar is able to accumulate more Se in grain.

AB Honeybees (Apis mellifera) play an important role in agriculture worldwide. Several factors including agrochemicals can affect honey bee health including habitat fragmentation, pesticide application, and pests. The growing human population and subsequent increasing crop production have led to widespread use of agrochemicals and there is growing concern that pollinators are being negatively impacted by these pesticides. The present study compares acute exposure to imidacloprid (0.2 and 0.4 mgL(-1)), ethion (80 and 106.7 mgL(-1)) or glyphosate (0.12 and 0.24 mgL(-1)) on aversive learning and movement, to chronic exposure at these and higher concentrations on movement, circadian rhythms, and survival in honey bee foragers. For acute learning studies, a blue/yellow shuttle box experiment was conducted; we observed honey bee choice following aversive and neutral stimuli. In learning studies, control bees spent >50% of the time on yellow which is not consistent with previous color bias literature in the subspecies or region of the study. The learning apparatus was also used to estimate mobility effects within 20 min of exposure. Chronic exposure (up to 2 weeks) with the above metrics was recorded by an automated monitoring system. In chronic exposure experiments, Roundup (R), was also tested to compare to its active ingredient, glyphosate. We found that imidacloprid and ethion have negative impacts on aversive learning and movement following a single-dose and that chronic exposure effects were dose-dependent for these two insecticides. In contrast, glyphosate had no effect on learning and less of an effect on movement; Roundup (R) showed dose-dependent results on circadian rhythmicity. Overall, the results suggest that short-term exposure to imidacloprid and ethion adversely affect honey bee foragers and chronic exposure to glyphosate may affect pollination success.

AB Human exposure to methylmercury (MeHg) due to contaminated fish intake as part of a high-fat (HFD), high-carbohydrate diets is a reality today for many populations. HFD is associated with hypertension and hyperlipidemia, primary cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Some studies suggest that MeHg induces those risk factors. We evaluated the effect of MeHg exposure in mice fed with HFD or control diet for eight weeks. In the last experimental 15 days, the half group received a MeHg solution (20 mg/L) replacing water. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate, lipoprotein concentrations, and paraoxonase activity were evaluated. Liver cholesterol, triacylglyceml, and IBA-1+ cells, as well as transcriptional levels of genes related to lipid metabolism and inflammatory response, were also assessed. HFD and both MeHg groups presented increased BP and total cholesterol (TC). In the liver, HFD but not MeHg was related to an increase in TC. Also, MeHg intoxication reduced paraoxonase activity regardless of diet. MeHg intoxication and HFD increased steatosis and the number of IBA-1+ cells and modified some gene transcripts associated with lipid metabolism. In conclusion, we demonstrated that MeHg effects on CVD risk factors resemble those caused by HFD.

AB Due to the accumulation of heavy metals in soil ecosystems, the response of soil microorganisms to the disturbance of heavy metals were widely studied. However, little was known about the interactions among microorganisms in heavy metals and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) co-contaminated soils. In the present study, the microbiota shifts of 2 different contamination types of heavy metal-TPH polluted soils were investigated. NGS sequencing approach was adopted to illustrate the microbial community structure and to predict community function. Networks were established to reveal the interactions between microbes and environmental pollutants. Results showed that the alpha diversity and OTUs number of soil microbiota were reduced under heavy metals and TPH pollutants. TPH was the major pollutant in HT1 group, in which Proteobacteria phylum increased significantly, including Arenimonas genus, Sphingomonadaceae family and Burkholderiaceae family. Moreover, the function structures based on the KEGG database of HT1 group was enriched in the benzene matter metabolism and bacterial motoricity in microbiota. In contrast, severe Cr-Pb-TPH co-pollutants in HT2 increased the abundance of Firmicutes. In details, the relative abundance of Streptococcus genus and Bacilli class raised sharply. The DNA replication functions in microbiota were enriched under severely contaminated soil as a result of high concentrations of heavy metals and TPH pollutants' damage to bacteria. Furthermore, according to the correlation analysis between microbes and the pollutants, Streptococcus, Neisseria, Aeromonas, Porphyromonas and Acinetobacter were suggested as the bioremediation bacteria for Cr and Pb polluted soils, while Syntrophaceae spp. and Immundisolibacter were suggested as the bioremediation bacteria for TPH polluted soil. The study took a survey on the microbiota shifts of the heavy metals and TPH polluted soils, and the microbe's biomarkers provided new insights for the candidate strains of biodegradation, while further researches are required to verify the biodegradation mechanism of these biomarkers.

AB Iron (hydr)oxide-natural organic matter (NOM) colloids, the dominant components of soil, usually occur in varied circumstances and may affect Hg transport and fate in soil. This study aims to reveal the Hg binding to preformed composites rather than only focusing on Hg retention by iron (hydr)oxides in the presence of NOM. Ferrihydrite-humic acid (FH-HA) is chosen as a representative composite, and the effect of the complexation method and FH morphology on Hg binding to various composites is evaluated. Three types of composites are developed: a dense coprecipitated composite (p-d-f), a gel-like adsorbed composite (a-g-f) and a dense adsorbed (a-d-f) composite. Batch sorption and stirred-flow kinetic tests together with surface property analysis and modern spectral analyses are carried out to explore the binding behavior of Hg to the three composites and clarify the interactions in the ternary systems of FH-HA-Hg. The results show that the Hg sorption isotherms all fit well with the Langmuir model, and the maximum sorption capacities follow the order a-g-f> a-d-f > p-d-f, implying that the adsorbed composite is more favorable than the coprecipitated composite for Hg binding and a gel morphology is more beneficial than a dense morphology. The stirred-flow experiments show that the adsorbed composite has a small advantage in Hg sorption compared to the coprecipitated composite and that the gel-like composite can adsorb more Hg at a faster rate than the dense composite. Both FH and HA participate in Hg sorption, and FH-HA-Hg complexes are speculated to form. These findings are helpful to better understand the mobility and fate of Hg in soils, as well as the associated dynamic model for predicting Hg behavior in the environment where the iron (hydr) oxide-NOM composites are pre-existed.

AB The widely distributed seaweed Ulva fasciata has nutrient absorption abilities and can be used in the bioremediation of polluted maricultural environments. This study explored microbial community and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) variation in mariculture sediments in response to different trace levels (10, 100, and 500 mu g L-1) of oxytetracycline (OTC) and the presence of Ulva fasciata. The increase in OTC level promoted nutrient (NO3--N and PO43--P) removal mainly due to Ulva fasciata adsorption. The abundances of the Euryarchaeota and Planctomycetes phyla in sediments were positively related to the increase in OTC stress, while a negative correlation occurred for the Proteobacteria phylum via metagenomic analysis. Compared with the control system, the increase rates of total ARGs were 3.90%, 7.36% and 13.42% at the OTC levels of 10, 100 and 500 mu g L-1, respectively. OTC stress mainly favoured the collateral enrichment of non-corresponding polypeptide and MLS ARGs, mainly due to the enrichment of the phyla Planctomycetes and Euryarchaeota by the synergistic effect of OTC and nutrients. The results of quantitative PCR with tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) (tetO, tetT, tetPB, tetW and otrA) and a horizontal transfer gene (inti1) demonstrated that all of genes had much higher gene numbers in sediments after 3 months of OTC stress than in those without OTC stress, which was strongly related to the variation in the phyla Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes and Acidobacteria. The significant correlation between intl1 and the target TRGs is indicative of the important role of the horizontal transfer of integron-resistant genes in the spread of TRGs.

AB Bone mineral density (BMD) changes were reported to be associated with excessive fluoride exposure and abnormal expression of RUNX2. However, whether the alteration of methylation status, a most commonly used marker for the alteration of gene expression in epidemiological investigation, of RUNX2 is associated with low to-moderate fluoride exposure and BMD changes has not been reported. Our study aims to explore the role of RUNX2 promoter methylation in BMD changes induced by low-to-moderate fluoride exposure. A total of 1124 adults (413 men and 711 women) were recruited from Kaifeng City in 2017. We measured BMD using ultrasound bone densitometer. Concentrations of urinary fluoride (UF) were measured using ion-selective electrode, and the participants were grouped into control group (CG) and excessive fluoride group (EFG) according to the concentration of UF. We extracted DNA from fasting peripheral blood samples and then detected the promoter methylation levels of RUNX2 using quantitative methylation-specific PCR. Relationships between UF concentration, RUNX2 promoter methylation and BMD changes were analyzed using generalized linear model and logistic regression. Results showed in EFG (UF concentration > 1.6 mg/L), BMD was negatively correlated with UF concentration (beta-0.14; 95%CI:-0.26,-0.01) and RUNX2 promoter methylation (beta-0.13; 95%CI:-0.22,-0.03) in women. The methylation rate of RUNX2 promoter increased by 2.16% for each 1 mg/L increment in UF concentration of women in EFG (95%CI: 0.37, 3.96). No any significant associations between UF concentration, RUNX2 promoter methylation, and BMD were observed in the individuals in CG. Mediation analysis showed that RUNX2 promoter methylation mediated 18.2% (95% CI: 4.2%, 53.2%) of the association between UF concentration and BMD of women in EFG. In conclusion, excessive fluoride exposure (>1.6 mg/L) is associated with changes of BMD in women, and this association is mediated by RUNX2 promoter methylation.

AB We investigated individual and combined effects of environmentally representative concentrations of amoxicillin (AMX; 2 mu g l(-1)), enrofloxacin (ENR; 2 mu g l(-1)), and oxytetracycline (OXY; 1 mu g l1) on the aquatic macrophyte Lemna minor. While the concentrations of AMX and ENR tested were not toxic, OXY decreased plant growth and cell division. OXY induced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation and related oxidative stress through its interference with the activities of mitochondria electron transport chain enzymes, although those deleterious effects could be ameliorated by the presence of AMX and/or ENR, which prevented the overaccumulation of ROS by increasing catalase enzyme activity. L. minor plants accumulated significant quantities of AMX, ENR and OXY from the media, although competitive uptakes were observed when plants were submitted to binary or tertiary mixtures of those antibiotics. Our results therefore indicate L. minor as a candidate for phytoremediation of service waters contaminated by AMX, ENR, and/or OXY.

AB Nickel (Ni) is a widely distributed metal in the environment and an important pollutant because of its many industrial applications. With increasing incidences of Ni contamination, Ni toxicity has become a global public health concern and recent evidence suggests that Ni adversely affects the immune system. Hence, this paper reviews the literature on immune-related effects of Ni exposure, the immunotoxicological effects of Ni, and the underlying mechanism of Ni immunotoxicity. The main focus was on the effect of Ni on the development of organs of immune system, lymphocyte subpopulations, cytokines, immunoglobulins, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages. Moreover, Ni toxicity also induces inflammation and several studies demonstrated that Ni could induce immunotoxicity. Excessive Ni exposure can inhibit the development of immune organs by excessively inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation. Furthermore, Ni can decrease T and B lymphocytes, the specific mechanism of which requires further research. The effects of Ni on immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, and IgM remain unknown and while Ni inhibited IgA, IgG, and IgM levels in an animal experiment, the opposite result was found in research on humans. Ni inhibits the production of cytokines in non-inflammatory responses. Cytokine levels increased in Ni-induced inflammation responses, and Ni activates inflammation through toll like (TL)4-mediated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and signal transduction cascades mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Ni has been indicated to inactivate NK cells and macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. Identifying the mechanisms underlying the Ni-induced immunotoxicity may help to explain the growing risk of infections and cancers in human populations that have been exposed to Ni for a long time. Such knowledge may also help to prevent and treat Ni-related carcinogenicity and toxicology.

AB Chelating agents have been considered as an important phytoremediation strategy to enhance heavy metal extraction from contaminated soil. A pot experiment was conducted to explore the effects of low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) on the phytoremediation efficiency of copper (Cu) by castor bean, and soil enzyme activities. Results indicated that the addition of all the three kinds of LMWOAs (citric, tartaric, oxalic acids) did not decrease the biomass of castor bean, despite the fact they reduced the concentration of chlorophyll a in leaves compared to the control. The Cu concentrations in the roots and shoots significantly increased by 6-106% and 5-148%, respectively, in the LMWOAs treatments so that the total accumulation of Cu by whole plants in all the LMWOAs treatments increased by 21-189% in comparison with the control. The values of the translocation factor (TF) and bio-concentration factor (BCF) of Cu in castor bean also rose following the addition of LMWOAs, indicating that the LMWOAs enhanced the uptake and transportation of Cu. Moreover, the application of LMWOAs did not significantly change the soil pH but significantly increased the activity of soil enzymes (urease, catalase, and alkaline phosphatase). The addition of exogenous LMWOAs increased the available Cu significantly in the soil, thus promoted the phytoextraction efficiency of Cu by castor bean. These results will provide some new insights into the practical use of LMWOAs for the phytoremediation of heavy-metal contaminated soil employing castor bean.

AB Agricultural pesticides serve as effective controls of unwanted weeds and pests. However, these same chemicals can exert toxic effects in non-target organisms. To determine chemical modes of action, the toxicity ratio (TR) and critical body residues (CBRs) of 57 pesticides were calculated for Daphnia magna. Results showed that the CBR values of inert compounds were close to a constant while the CBR values of pesticides varied over a wider range. Although herbicides are categorized as specifically-acting compounds to plants, herbicides did not exhibit excess toxicity to Daphnia magna and were categorized as inert compounds with an average logTR 1/4 0.41, which was less than a threshold of one. Conversely, fungicides and insecticides exhibited strong potential for toxic effects to Daphnia magna with an average logTR >2. Many of these chemicals act via disruption of the nervous, respiratory, or reproductive system, with high ligand-receptor binding activity which leads to higher toxicity for Daphnia magna. Molecular docking using acetylcholinesterase revealed that fungicides and insecticides bind more easily with the biological macromolecule when compared with inert compounds. Quantitative structureactivity relationship (QSAR) analysis revealed that the toxicity of fungicides was mainly dependent upon the heat of formation and polar surface area, while the toxicity of insecticides was more related to hydrogen-bond properties. This comprehensive analysis reveals that there are specific differences in toxic mechanisms between fungicides and insecticides. These results are useful for determining relative risk associated with pesticide exposure to aquatic crustaceans, such as Daphnia magna.

AB Chronic exposure to fluoride (F) beyond the permissible limit (1.5 ppm) is known to cause detrimental health effects by induction of oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage overpowering the DNA repair machinery. In the present study, we assessed F induced oxidative stress through monitoring biochemical parameters and looked into the effect of chronic F exposure on two crucial DNA repair genes Ogg1 and Rad51 having important role against ROS induced DNA damages. To address this issue, we exposed Swiss albino mice to an environmentally relevant concentration of fluoride (15 ppm NaF) for 8 months. Results revealed histoarchitectural damages in liver, brain, kidney and spleen. Depletion of GSH, increase in lipid peroxidation and catalase activity in liver and brain confirmed the generation of oxidative stress. qRT-PCR result showed that expressions of Ogg1 and Rad51 were altered after F exposure in the affected organs. Promoter hypermethylation was associated with the downregulation of Rad51. F-induced DNA damage and the compromised DNA repair machinery triggered intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in liver and brain. The present study indicates the possible association of epigenetic regulation with F induced neurotoxicity.

AB This work evaluates different generations of transgenic (cp4-EPSPS gene) and non-transgenic soybean plants through proteomics and metabolomics. For proteomics purpose, 24 differentially abundant protein spots were found through 2-D DIGE, being 4 belonging to transgenic plants. From this total, 19 were successfully identified, storage proteins as predominant class. Some identified proteins are involved in growing and cell division, and stress response, such as LEA and dehydrin. For metabolomics, 17 compounds were putatively annotated, mainly belonging to the secondary metabolism, such as flavonoids. From these analyzes, all generations and varieties of the soybean are prone to be differentiate by PLS-DA. According to our results, transgenic plants appear to be more stable than non-transgenic ones. In addition, the omics-based approaches allowed access some relations between those differential spot proteins and metabolites, mainly those storage proteins and flavonoid.

AB Many studies have reported that exposure to ambient air pollution has adverse effects on health. However, there are little researches to explore the relationship between ambient air pollution and chronic sinusitis (CS). From January 1 2015 to December 31 2018, a time-series study were carried out to investigate the acute adverse roles of six criteria ambient air pollutants (fine particulate matter [PM2.5], inhalable particulate matter [PM10], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], sulfur dioxide [SO2], ozone [O-3], and carbon monoxide [CO]) in hospital outpatients with CS in Xinxiang, China. Then, an over-dispersed Poisson generalized additive model was utilized to analyzed the relationships. In total, 183,943 hospital outpatient cases of CS were identified during the study period. We found that a 10 mu g/m3 increase in PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO corresponded to 0.48% (95% confidence interval: 0.22-0.74%), 0.33% (0.16-0.50%), 0.88% (0.13-1.62%), 1.98% (1.31-2.64%), and 0.05% (0.03-0.07%) increments, respectively, in CS outpatients on the current day. The young group (<15 years of age) was more susceptible than the adult or elderly groups. These results suggested that outdoor air pollutants might increase CS outpatient, especially among youth in Xinxiang. Precautions and protective measures should be strengthened to reduce the air pollution level in the future.

AB Chinese milk vetch is an efficient approach to reduce Cd accumulation in rice, nevertheless, its reduction mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the rice grain Cd, soil properties and microbial community in a Cd-polluted paddy field amended with milk vetch residue (MV) or without (CK) during rice growth period. We found that milk vetch residue averagely decreased the Cd content in rice grain by 45%. Decrease of Cd in rice mainly attributed to the inhibition of Cd activation by milk vetch residue at heading stage probably by the formation of HA-Cd (Humic Acid) and CdS. Increased pH and organic matter (OM) promoted the reduction of available Cd. In addition, nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis revealed that microbial community structure was significantly different between MV and CK treatment (r = 0.187, p = 0.002), and the core functions of differentially abundant genera were mainly associated with N-cycling, organic matter degradation and sulfate-reducing. The application of milk vetch residue increased the abundance of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) by 8-112% during the rice growth period, which may involve in promoting the transformation of Cd to a more stably residual Cd (CdS). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and mantel test analysis indicated that available K (p = 0.004) and available N (p = 0.005) were the key environmental factors of shaping the SRB. Altogether, changes in soil properties affected microbial structure and functional characteristics, especially the response of SRB in MV treatment would provide valuable insights into reducing the bioavailability of Cd in soil.

AB As an effective feed additive in the livestock industry, olaquindox (OLA) has been widely used in domestic animal production. However, it is unclear whether OLA has negative effects on mammalian oocyte quality and fetal development. In this study, toxic effects of OLA were tested by intragastric gavage ICR mice with water, low-dose OLA (5 mg/kg/day), or high-dose OLA (60 mg/kg/day) for continuous 45 days. Results showed that high-dose OLA gavage severely affected the offspring birth and growth. Significantly, high-dose OLA impaired oocyte maturation and early embryo development, indicated by the decreased percentage of germinal vesicle breakdown, first polar body extrusion and blastocyst formation. Meanwhile, oxidative stress levels were increased in oocytes or ovaries, indexed by the increased levels of ROS, MDA, H2O2, NO, and decreased levels of GSH, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px and GSH-Rd. Furthermore, aberrant mitochondria distribution, defective spindle assembly, abnormal H3K4me2/H3K9me3 levels, increased DNA double-strand breaks and early apoptosis rate, were observed after high-dose OLA gavage. Taken together, our results for the first time illustrated that high-dose OLA gavage led to sub-fertility of females, which means that restricted utilization of OLA as feed additive should be considered.

The pre-treatment was performed with three types of agents including Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), citric acid (CA), and mixture of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and citric acid (HA)) and the post-treatment stabilization was adopted using four rich-carbon organic waste amendments (cow manure compost (CMC), vermicompost (VC), urban sewage sludge (SS), and sludge-derived biochar (BIO)). Furthermore, the fate of residual metals (leachability, plant-availability, bioaccessibility, and chemical distribution), soil quality indicators (phytotoxicity and enzyme activities), and some soil physico-chemical properties were examined before and after the two-steps remediation. The soil washing, especially using HA and CA agents, dramatically increased the labile metals and negatively changed the soil microbial activity. The two-month stabilization with SS, BIO, and VC resulted in a significant control of the leachability and plant-availability of residual Zn and Pb. However, the post-treatment was only slightly immobilized of Cd. The amendments affected the restoration of soil pH and organic carbon as well as the improvement of available nutrients. Compared to the other amendments that caused restrictions, the SS significantly restored the enzyme activities. With the exception of CMC, the SS, VC, and BIO, indicated higher germination rate and growth of wheat were also obtained. This study reveal the ability of the complementary role of stabilization with soil washing to reduce metal toxicity and confirm the usefulness of municipal and animal wastes in enhancing soil and environmental qualities.

AB In the study, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were examined in wastewater and sludge samples to explore the effect of cephalexin (CFX) on the spreading and removal of ARGs in the Expanded Granular Sludge Bed (EGSB) reactor treating antibiotics wastewater. The result showed that the addition of CFX in the wastewater affected the removal amount of beta-lactam ARGs and other types ARGs. Besides, the addition of CFX in the wastewater had no obviously effect on total concentration of targeted ARGs in the sludge, but it was related to the accumulation of some typical ARGs. Based on gene cassette array libraries analysis, the diversity of gene cassettes carried by intI1 gene was increased by the addition of CFX in the wastewater. Furthermore, the co-occurrence patterns between ARGs and bacterial genus were also investigated. The results showed the CFX in the wastewater not only affected the number of potential host bacteria of ARGs, but also changed the types of potential host bacteria of ARGs. The correlation analysis of ARG in influent, effluent and sludge showed that, for blaCTX-M, sul2, qnrS and AmpC genes, their removal amount in EGSB reactor treating antibiotic wastewater system might be enhanced by reducing their concentration in the sludge.

AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are toxic to microorganisms, thereby affecting microbial communities in sludge and soil, but how to repair the toxicity of microorganisms remains unclear. In this study, rutin, an antioxidant, was added into a culture medium with an aerobic denitrification bacteria, Pseudomonas stutzeri, under the exposure of sodium perfluorononyloxy-benzenesulfonate (OBS) to evaluate the repair mechanisms of rutin to the toxicity of OBS to the bacteria. The results showed that rutin could repair the damage of OBS to cell structures, and reduce the death rates of the bacteria under OBS exposure. The dosage of rutin reduced the effect on the inhibition of denitrification ability of P. stutzeri under OBS exposure. Compared with the bacteria exposed to single OBS, the dosage of rutin resulted in that the death rates recovered from 96.2% to 66.4%, the growth inhibition rate decreased from 46.5% to 15.8%, the total nitrogen removal rate recovered from 66.9% to 100%, and the NO2- content recovered from 34.5 mg/L to 0.22 mg/L. The expressions of key denitrification genes (napA, nirS, norB, nosZ) were recovered after adding rutin under OBS exposure. Rutin changed the positive rate of reactive oxygen species, the relative superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in the bacteria which exposed to OBS. The mechanism by which rutin repaired the toxicity of OBS to P. stutzeri related to inhibiting the activities of antioxidant and denitrification enzymes rather than affecting the expressions of genes involved in these enzymes. This study sheds light on the repair method of micro-organics and reveals the repair mechanisms under PFASs exposure.

AB Cadmium (Cd) is an inauspicious abiotic traction that not only influences crop productivity and its growth parameters, but also has adverse effects on human health if these crops are consumed. Among crops, leafy vegetables which are the good source of mineral and vitamins accumulate more Cd than other vegetables. It is thus important to study photosynthetic variables, amino acid composition, and ultrastructural localization of Cd differences in response to Cd accumulation between two low and high Cd accumulating Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis L. (pak choi) cultivars, differing in Cd accumulation ability. Elevated Cd concentrations significantly lowered plant growth rate, biomass, leaf gas exchange and concentrations of amino acids collated to respective controls of both cultivars. Electron microscopy indicated that the impact of high Cd level on ultrastructure of leaf cells was associated to affecting cell functionalities, i.e. irregular cell wall, withdrawal of cell membrane, and chloroplast structure which has negative impact on photosynthetic activities, thus causing considerable plant growth suppression. Damage in root cells were observed in the form of enlargement of vacuole. The energy dispersive micro X-ray spectroscopy of both cultivars leaves indicated that cellular structure exhibited exudates of Cd-dense material. Ultrastructural damages and phytotoxicity were more pronounced in high accumulator cultivar as compared to the low accumulator cultivar. These findings are useful in determining the mechanisms of differential Cd-tolerance among cultivars with different Cd tolerance abilities at cellular level.

AB Finding a sound ecological-based approach for the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) from petroleum oily sludge (POS) generated in oil refinery plants is still a challenge. This study investigated the removal of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) using bioaugmentated composting (BC) by hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (HDB) and vermicomposting (VC) by Eisenia fetida, individually and in combination (BCVC). After isolating two native bacterial strains from POS prepared from an oil refinery plant in Iran, the degradation capability of their consortium was initially assessed in mineral Bushnell-Haas medium (MBHM). Then, the biodegradation rates of POS in the BC, VC, and BCVC treatments containing different concentrations of TPHs (5, 10, and 20 g/kg) were determined by measuring TPHs before and after the biodegradation. The results showed that the consortium degraded 20-62% of TPHs contents of Kerosene (1-5%) in the MBHM after 7 days. After 12 weeks, the TPHs removal percentages in the BC, VC, and BCVC treatments were respectively found to be 81-83, 31-49, and 85-91 indicating the synergistic effect of bacteria and worms in bioremediation of POS. The PHCs biodegradation in the BC, VC, and BCVC experiments was fitted to 1st order model kinetics. The results of toxicity tests indicated that the values of the no observed lethal concentration (NOLC) and median lethal concentration (LC50) of TPHs were 2-5 and 14.64 g/kg, respectively after 28 days of earthworm exposure. Morphological impairments such as swelling, coiling, and curling were observed when TPHs concentration was even lower than NOLC. The study verified the effectiveness of vermicomposting bioaugmentated with the indigenous bacterial consortium for POS bioremediation.

AB Cleome viscosa L. is a promising species for the phytoremediation of Mn-contaminanted soil. To reveal the adaptive mechanisms of species to Mn stress, plant growth, Mn subcellular distribution, Mn chemical forms, and plant physiological and biochemical traits were characterized in plants grown under different concentrations of Mn2+ (0, 1000, 5000, 10000, 15000 and 20000 mu M). The results showed that C. viscosa plant biomass initially increased and then decreased with rising Mn treatment concentration. C. viscosa plants can accumulate high levels of Mn in roots and leaves, and both the bioconcentration factor (BCF) and the translocation factor (TF) exhibited values higher than one. Mn was primarily retained in the cell wall and soluble fractions. Predominant chemical forms of Mn were pectate and protein, phosphates, and oxalates-integrated Mn. The activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and the contents of proline, soluble sugar, and soluble protein initially increased and then decreased with enhancing Mn treatment concentration, whereas the malondialdehyde (MDA) content simultaneously displayed a gradual increase. Combined, these results indicate that C. viscosa can tolerate Mn-stress conditions by increasing antioxidant enzyme activities and non-enzymatic metabolites contents. In addition, Mn immobilization in the cell wall and soluble fractions, alongside the storage of Mn in low-activity chemical forms are further important mechanisms to cope with high environmental Mn concentration. This study reveals the adaptive mechanisms of plants to Mn stress, and provides a theoretical basis for the use of C. viscosa as a candidate phytoremediation plant for Mncontaminated soil.

AB Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a recently identified and persistent organic pollutant that becomes enriched in living organisms via bioaccumulation and the food chain. PFOS can induce various disorders, including liver toxicity, neurotoxicity and metabolic dysregulation. Most recent studies have shown a close association of the gut microbiota with the occurrence of diseases. However, few studies have explored the effects of PFOS on the gut environment, including the intestinal flora and barrier. In this study, we evaluated the effects of PFOS in C57BL/6J male mice and explored the relationship between tissue damage and the gut environment. Mice were orally exposed to PFOS for 16 days. Liver damage was assessed by examining the inflammatory reaction in the liver and serum liver enzyme concentrations. Metabolic function was assessed by the hepatic cholesterol level and the serum concentrations of glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides. Intestinal environmental disorders were assessed by evaluating the gut microbiota, SCFAs production, inflammatory reactions and intestinal tight junction protein expression. Our results indicated that PFOS affected inflammatory reactions in the liver and colon and promoted the development of metabolic disorders (especially of cholesterol and glucose metabolism). Moreover, PFOS dysregulated various populations in the gut microbiota (e.g., Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Clostridiales, Enterobacteriales, Lactobacillales, Erysipelotrichaceae, Rikenellaceae, Ruminococcaceae and Blautia) and induced a loss of gut barrier integrity by reducing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production and intestinal tight junction protein expression. A Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis mainly identified metabolic pathways (e.g., the adipocytokine signalling pathway), endocrine system pathways (e.g., steroid hormone biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis), the latter of which is widely considered to be associated with metabolism. Overall, our results suggest that PFOS damages various aspects of the gut environment, including the microbiota, SCFAs and barrier function, and thereby exacerbates the toxicity associated with liver, gut and metabolic disorders.

AB A new Electrocoagulation (EC) technique, sinusoidal AC coagulation (SACC), is creatively put forward for Cu2+ removal in the wastewater from the printed circuit board (PCB) production in this paper. The removal efficiency of Cu2+ from PCB wastewater and energy consumption are compared by SACC and conventional direct current coagulation (DCC). The optimal process parameters were established through analysis of response surface methodology (RSM). The coagulations containing Cu2+ was characterized by SEM, EDS, TEM,BET, XRD and FTIR. The nano-ferrum collosol, mainly composed of goethite (alpha-FeOOH) and magnetite (gamma-Fe2O3), absorbs the Cu2+ and coagulates to remove Cu2+. The results show that the removal rates of Cu2+ by SACC and DCC are 99.86% and 98.21%, respectively, and the energy consumption is 2.76 x 10(-2) kWh.m(-3) for SACC and 4.42 x 10(-2) kWh.m(-3) for DCC under the optimal process conditions of c(0) (Cu2+) = 41.99 mg.dm(-3), pH = 7.14, j = 0.293 A.m(-2), t = 16.7 min. The pilot tests indicate that the SACC technique is feasible in industrial application. Cu2+ removal were completed through electrodeposition of Cu2+ on iron electrode, the deposition of Cu(OH)(2) and the adsorption of Cu2+ by ferrum collosol. The adsorption follows the pseudo-second order kinetics model well. The maximum saturated adsorption capacity (q(max)) of Cu2+ on ferrum collosol produced by SACC is larger than that by DCC. The adsorption of Cu2+ on the ferrum collosol prepared by SACC and DCC are in accordance with Langmuir's adsorption isotherms. The novel SACC technique is a promising technique for the highly-efficient treatment of Cu2+ from PCB wastewater.

AB In order to investigate pollution level, chemical speciation and health risk of exposure to heavy metals in street dust from smelting district, we carried the following studies: (a). the differences in the morphology of street dust in smelting and non-smelting districts using a scanning electron microscope; (b). the chemical speciation and bioavailability of heavy metals in <100 mu m and <63 mu m particles near a smelting district using a modified three-stage BCR sequential extraction procedure and in vitro digestion test, respectively; (c). the evaluation of the non-carcinogenic risk of children and adults exposure to dust based on bioaccessibility. The results showed that most of the dust particles near Huludao Zinc Plant (HZP) were relatively solid with less porosity, which might originate from incompletely burned mineral particles from the smelting process. The concentrations of Pb, Cd and Cu were much higher than the background levels: 1560, 178.5 and 917.9 mg kg(-1) in <100 mu m dust samples, and 2099, 198.4, 1038 mg kg(-1) in <63 mu m dust samples, respectively. Pb was mostly present in the reducible fraction and the acid exchangeable fraction, while Cd and Cu were the most common heavy metals in the acid exchangeable fraction and oxidizable fraction, respectively. The rank order of bioaccessibility for the gastric and intestinal phase was Cd (58.13%) > Pb (50.00%) > Cu (19.19%) and Cd (20.36%) > Cu (15.67%) > Pb (5.08%), respectively. Hand-to-mouth ingestion poses the greatest non-carcinogenic exposure risk compared with other exposure pathways. When bioavailability is taken into account, children experienced higher non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of dust exposure compared with adults, and the <63 mu m particles posed greater risks than <100 mu m particles.

AB Nano-sized Fe2Zr2-xWxO7 system was prepared using the Pacini method where x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15. All the samples were characterized using chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance measurements (DRS) and surface area measurements. The undoped Fe2Zr2O7 was crystallised in the cubic fluorite phase as a major phase in addition to rhombohedral phase of Fe2O3 and monoclinic phase of ZrO2 as the minor phases. Meanwhile, single cubic fluorite phase was defined for Fe2Zr0.85W0.15O7 sample. The last has the lowest band gap (1.69 eV) and the highest surface area (106 m(2)/g). From TEM, the average particle size of the prepared samples was in the range of (3-7 nm). The photocatalytic efficiency of the prepared Fe2Zr2-xWxO7 system was manifested by the degradation of methylene blue and real textile wastewater of blue colour. Ascending degradation efficiency was exhibited with increasing tungsten concentration which is in accordance with their band gap as well as their surface area values. The degradation rate using Fe2Zr0.85W0.15O7 sample obeys the pseudo-first order kinetic at the optimum degradation conditions (1.5 g/L catalyst and pH11). Fe2Zr0.85W0.15O7 showed promising photocatalytic activity for real textile wastewater where the 69% COD removal was obtained under the same conditions used for methylene blue degradation.

AB Biopurification systems (BPS) or biobeds have been developed to attenuate point-source contamination due to inappropriate pesticide handling or disposal of agricultural wastewaters. The biomixture used for this strategy should be able to remove different active ingredients but its efficiency can vary due to the constant load of pesticides from crop application programs. For that reason, the performance of biomixtures in conditions that mimic the real pesticide treatment before their implementation in field settings should be assayed. This study aimed to evaluate the removal and detoxifying capacity of a previously formulated biomixture (coconut fiber, 50% v/v; compost, 25%; and soil pre-exposed to pesticides, 25%) during a simulated cycle of pesticide application (93 days) for potato production. The scheme included a first application of linuron followed by a weekly alternated treatment of the mixtures chlorpyrifos/metalaxyl and malathion/dimethomorph, and antibiotics at day 72. The biomixture showed efficient removal of linuron (half-life < 15 days), and a fluctuating transformation rate for the other compounds. A constant and sustained removal was observed for malathion and methalaxyl. In contrast, lower efficiency and accumulation was described for chlorpyrifos and dimethomorph. Following antibiotic treatment, changes on pesticide removal were observed only in the case of chlorpyrifos, whose removal was slightly enhanced. Furthermore, acute toxicity assays showed limited detoxification of the matrix, especially when compounds began to accumulate. Summarizing, our experiments showed that the proposed biomixture does not support a proper removal of the pesticides during the simulated application cycle of potato production. Further optimization of a biopurification system is required to guarantee the successful elimination of pesticide combinations when applied in field conditions.

AB Application of synthetic pesticides over decades to control insects, pests, and disease vectors has resulted in negative impacts on environment and health. The current study assessed the toxicological effects of 12 botanicals obtained from 4 different red seaweeds against the dengue vector mosquito Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae). Four species of red seaweeds, namely Laurencia karachiana, Gracilaria foliifera, Jania rubens, Asparagopsis taxiformis, were collected from Karachi coast and extracted with hexane, dichloromethane and methanol. The efficiency of these extracts was determined by using a dose-response bioassay method against 4th instar larvae of Ae. aegypti. Separate investigations on the toxicity and IGI effects were done. Comparative studies showed that the hexane extracts induced more toxic effects. Based on the LC50 values, obtained after 24 h of treatments, hexane extract of J. rubens (HJ) exhibited toxic effects with LC50 32 mu g/mL, (equivalent to GHS category 3), followed by G. foliifera (HG) (LC50 76.8 mu g/mL). HJ also showed prominent neurotoxic effects within 1-6 h. Comparatively, higher morphological abnormalities and growth inhibiting (IGI) effects were obtained in the dichloromethane and methanol extracts treated larvae, after 48-96 h, resulting in the formation of immature life forms such as larvi-pupae and pupi-adult. Presumptive growth inhibiting effects were also noted. These included formation of albino and black pupae, deformities in the internal structure of the treated larvae and the chitin synthesis related effects such as 'inhibiting effect on adult emergence'. Finding revealed that red seaweeds, harvested from the Arabian Sea, have potentials to affect Ae. aegypti survival and thus can be utilized as green pesticides.

AB Anthropogenic activities mediated antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the pristine aquatic bodies (lakes) is raising concern worldwide. Long read shotgun sequencing was used to assess taxonomic diversity, distribution of ARGs and metal resistance genes (MRGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in six sites within hypersaline Lonar soda lake (India) prone to various anthropogenic activities. Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota were dominant phyla under domain Bacteria and Archaea respectively. Higher abundance of Bacteroidetes was pragmatic at sites 18LN5 and 18LN6. Functional analysis indicated 26 broad-spectrum ARGs types, not reported earlier in this ecosystem. Abundant ARG types identified were multidrug efflux, glycopepetide, bacitracin, tetracycline and aminogylcoside resistance. Sites 18LN1 and 18LN5 depicted 167 and 160 different ARGs subtypes respectively and rpoB2, bcrA, tetA(48), mupA, ompR, patA, vanR and multidrug ABC transporter genes were present in all samples. The rpoB2 gene was dominant in 18LN1, whereas bcrA gene in 18LN2-18LN6 sites. Around 24 MRGs types were detected with higher abundance of arsenic in 18LN1 and copper in 18LN2-18LN6, signifying metal contamination linked to MRGs. The bacterial taxa Pseudomonas, Thioalkalivibrio, Burkholderia, Clostridium, Paenibacillus, Bacillus and Streptomyces were significantly associated with ARGs. This study highlights the resistomic hotspots in the lake for deploying policies for conservation efforts.

AB The commercial farming of Atlantic salmon, Salmo solar, may require the periodic application of emamectin benzoate (EB) treatments to reduce the effects of biological pests, such as sea lice. As a result, EB is detected in sediments beneath these fish farms at considerable levels. Literature sediment toxicity data for EB for marine benthic species is only available for 10-day sediment toxicity tests, which might be too short to assess field effects. Here, we present a sediment toxicity test to determine 28-day mortality and growth effect concentrations for the non-target polychaete worm Arenicola marina, the crustacean Corophium volutator and the mollusk Cerastoderma edule using a marine microcosm setup. Results indicate that no concentration-dependent increase of mortality and growth rate was apparent to A. marina and C. edule. But for C. volutator, a concentration-dependent increase in mortality was observed, resulting in a calculated 28-d LC50 of 316 mu g/kg dry sediment (95% confidence interval: 267-373 mu g/kg dry sediment). There were significant effects on C. volutator growth rate at concentrations of 100 mu g/kg dry sediment and above (NOEC = 30 mu g/kg dry sediment). These observations show that C. volutator is more sensitive to EB than A. marina, which differs from results reported in previous studies. Comparison to the most sensitive NOEC (30 mu g/kg dry sediment) found for C. volutator (organisms of 8-11 mm length), shows that the Environmental Quality Standard, derived by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in 2017 which based on freshwater species data (NOEC = 1.175 mu g/kg dry sediment), are relatively strict and is sufficiently protective for the marine species tested in this paper.

AB Smilax brasiliensis (Smilacaceae) is a native Brazilian plant found in the Cerrado biome and commonly used in folk medicine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the allelopathic, cytotoxic, genotoxic, and antigenotoxic potential of extract and fractions of Smilax brasiliensis leaves. Quercetin and rutin isomers were observed in the subfractions. The dichloromethane fraction (1000 mu g/mL) decreased lettuce (Lactuca saliva) seed vigor, while and ethyl acetate and hydromethanol fractions (1000 mu g/mL) affected the germination, and quercetin and rutin affected the vigor and germination of onion seeds. The extract, fractions, quercetin, and rutin inhibited or promoted lettuce hypocotyl and radicle growth. The extract and fractions inhibited onion hypocotyl growth at all concentrations. With regards to radicle growth, the results were diversified: growth was either inhibited or promoted. Rutin and quercetin inhibited onion hypocotyl and radicle growth at all concentrations. The extract and fractions of Smilax brasiliensis, rutin, and quercetin did not cause cytotoxic effect evaluated by mitotic index. The extract and fractions showed genotoxic effects. Quercetin and rutin did not cause genotoxic effects. On the other hand, the extract and fractions showed antigenotoxic effects at all tested concentrations, where they were able to revert chromosomal abnormalities caused by glyphosate. However, additional studies are required to evaluate the possible use of the S. brasiliensis leaf methanol extract and fractions as natural sources of bioherbicides.

AB The environmental release of graphene oxide (GO) will certainly induce the GO exposure to plants. To date, the influence of GO on the intracellular structures and the endophytic bacterial ecology of plants have been rarely reported. In the present study, the rice seedlings were exposed to GO (5 mg/L) under hydroponic condition for fifteen days with periodic stir. The cellular structures damage, GO deposition and oxidative stress were found in rice root after GO exposure. A Illumina analysis based on the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene showed that the richness, evenness and diversity of endophytic bacterial communities of rice root decreased due to GO exposure. The relative abundance of beneficial endophytic bacterial populations decreased after GO exposure. Out of potential phenotypes predicted by BugBase, the relative abundance of Gram negative, stress-tolerant and biofilm-forming phenotypes, presented an increase trend after GO exposure.

TI TBBPA regulates calcium-mediated lysosomal exocytosis and thereby

ID TETRABROMOBISPHENOL-A; CHANNEL; PERFORMANCE
AB Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and its derivatives are the common flame-retardants that may increase the risk of development of many types of cancers, including liver cancer. However, the effects of TBBPA in the development and progression of liver cancer remains unknown. This study investigated the potential effects of TBBPA on a metastatic phenotype of hepatocellular carcinoma cell line-HepG2. Our results revealed that TBBPA significantly promoted the migration and invasion via affecting the number and distribution of lysosomes in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, TBBPA decreased the intracellular protein levels of Beta-Hexosaminidase (HEXB), Cathepsin B (CTSB) and Cathepsin D (CTSD) while increased the extracellular CTSB and CTSD. It entailed that TBBPA exposure could promote the lysosomal exocytosis in cancer cells. The reversal results were obtained after adding lysosomal exocytosis inhibitor vacuolin-1. Docking results suggested that TBBPA could bind to TRPML1. It was consistent with the binding position of agonist ML-SAl. TRPML1 knockdown significantly decreased the invasion and migration, and the results were reversed when TBBPA was added. The results were indicated that TRPML1 was critical in lysosomal exocytosis. In addition, our results showed that TBBPA-TRPML1 complex regulated the calcium-mediated lysosomal exocytosis, thereby promoting the metastasis in liver cancer cells. It was expected that our data could provide important basis for understanding the molecular mechanism(s) of TBBPA promoting invasion and migration of hepatoma cells and give rise to profound concerns of TBBPA exposure on human health.

AB Present study highlighted the ultramicroscopic (SEM) alterations of the skin, eye, barbel, and fins of spawn of an air-breathing teleost (Clarias batrachus, Linn. 1758) induced by UV-B radiation (280-320 nm) at a dose (@ 4.07 x 10(-20)J/photon/m(2)) under the time-frame of 5, 10 and 15 min/d in the laboratory condition for the periods of 5 and 10 days. Limnological parameters revealed no significant changes throughout the period of experimentation which were measured by PCS Testr 35 Multi-Parameter. Morphometric analysis revealed that during the extended exposure period of 10 days the spawn size and weight were reduced as analysed through Specific Growth Rate (SGR). SGR values in terms of weight for 5 and 10 days under 3 time-frames were 17.12%, 12.52%, 11.46% and 9.09%, 6.43%, 6.09% respectively, which revealed a declined trend along with the exposure days. In the skin of C. batrachus, the compact regular orientation of the stratified epithelial cells and mucous cells became distorted and the microridges and double-ridged structures showed destruction and fragmentations. The body striations and microfolds became shrinked and swollen and finally degenerated to form a mass. The distribution of mucous cells throughout the epidermis was disorganised and releasing secretory contents on the surface through small pores. Appearance of huge quantity of biogenic semi-hexagonal plate like crystals (guanine platelets) on the skin surface of the body was the most significant observations during UV-B radiation. In the developmental phases the eyeball showed shrinkage loosing normal regular concave structure and to become a dome-shaped one. The supportive connective infoldings became loosened. The choroid coat displayed deformities and the iris deformed the pupil. The fibroblast on the epithelium and melanocytes depicted dispersed arrangement. The pairs of ventral barbels near the mouth depicted the presence of taste buds that became severely damaged exposing the sensory as well as neuroepithelial cells. Compact regular arrangement of the SECS was completely destroyed leaving long and deep channels inbetween them; the disintegrated concentric MRs also showed a mass.

AB Arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) are listed as the priority pollutants by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the European Union (EU) due to their toxicity and potential carcinogenicity. It is necessary to investigate their adsorption over soil as such a behavior affects their mobility and bioavailability. In this study, the effect of pH on the adsorption of As(V) and Sb(V) by the black soil was investigated with three systems: the Single system, Binary system, and Sequence system. The operating pH was set at 4.0, 7.0 and 10.0. Based on the Langmuir isothermal and the pseudo-second-order kinetic models, the adsorption for As(V) was always better than Sb(V) in the whole pH range; the best adsorption performance for the two sorbates was achieved at pH of 4.0, followed by 7.0 and 10.0 in the three systems. The reasons could be that the atomic radius of arsenic is smaller than that of antimony, and the positively charged functional groups carried by the inorganic colloids in the soil contributed to binding with the negatively charged As(V)/Sb(V). A lower pH promoted the inorganic colloids to carry more positive charges. Compared to Single system, the maximum adsorption capacity (q(m)) and the initial adsorption rates (k(2)q(e,cal)(2)) of As(V) and Sb(V) in Binary system decreased obviously, suggesting competitive adsorption occurred when As(V) and Sb(V) coexisted. The findings of this work improve the understanding of As(V)/Sb(V) adsorption behavior in soil under different situations and would facilitate a comprehensive evaluation on the risk assessment of arsenic and antimony.

AB Poor water quality exacerbates multidimensional poverty in developing nations. Often centralized treatment facilities generate acceptable water quality, but the water is contaminated during distribution. Methods to assess sources of contamination in water distribution systems are lacking. A case study of two methods, human risk assessment linked to water distribution system sampling was conducted in Hyderabad, Pakistan to determine areas requiring infrastructure rehabilitation. Water samples from source water (i.e., the Indus River), treatment plant effluent and from taps in the water distribution system were analyzed by atomic adsorption spectroscopy for metals and metalloids (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, and Pb) and water quality parameters (dissolved and suspended solids, pH, conductivity, and total organic carbon). Source water exceeded acceptable drinking water levels for As, Cd, total Cr, and Pb, while the treatment plant effluent concentrations were acceptable. Concentrations of all metals and metalloids, except Hg, increased in the water distribution system post-treatment, exceeding safe drinking limits in at least one location, suggesting contamination of the water during distribution. A deterministic and a probabilistic risk assessment were conducted to evaluate two scenarios: (1) unrestricted use of piped water for all household purposes, including as drinking water and (2) restricted use of the water for purposes other than drinking in the household, including only dermal and inhalation exposure pathways. The water was deemed unsafe for unrestricted use as the sole source of drinking water by both risk assessment methods. Yet when an alternative source of drinking water was assumed and the piped water was used only for bathing and dish washing, the probabilistic risk assessment revealed acceptable health risks to the population, while the overly conservative deterministic risk assessment suggested unacceptable risks. The combined methods of water sampling, risk assessment and correlation analysis suggested areas for rehabilitation of the water distribution system in Hyderabad, Pakistan and these methods can be adopted in other developing nations to target limited funds for infrastructure rehabilitation.

AB Denitrification and nitrification processes are the two prominent pathways of nitrogen (N) transformation in composting matrix. This study explored the dynamics of denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria at different composting stages of cow manure and corn straw using functional gene sequencing at DNA and cDNA levels. Corresponding agreement among OTUs, NMDS, mental test and network analyses revealed that functional bacteria community compositions and responses to physicochemical factors were different at DNA and cDNA levels. Specifically, some OTUs were detected at the DNA level but were not observed at cDNA level, differences were also found in the distribution patterns of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria communities at both levels. Furthermore, co-occurrence network analysis indicated that Pseudomonas, Paracoccus and Nitrosomonas were identified as the keystone OTUs at the DNA level, while Paracoccus, Agrobacterium and Nitrosospira were keystone OTUs at the cDNA level. Mantel test revealed that TN, C/N and moisture content significantly influenced both the denitrifying bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) communities at the DNA level. NO3--N, NH4+-N, TN, C/N, and moisture content only registered significant correlation with the nosZ-type denitrifiers and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) communities at the cDNA level. Structural equation model (SEM) showed that TN, NH4+-N, and pH were direct and significantly influenced the gene abundance of denitrifying bacteria. Howbeit, TN, NH4+-N, and NO3--N had significant direct effects on amoA gene abundance.

AB The purpose of this research was to examine the influence of hydrothermally treated coal gangue (HTCG) with and without biochar (BC) on the leaching, bioavailability, and redistribution of chemical fractions of heavy metals (HMs) in copper mine tailing (Cu-MT). An increase in pH, water holding capacity (WHC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) were observed due to the addition of BC in combination with raw coal gangue (RCG) and HTCG. A high Cu and other HMs concentration in pore water (PW) and amended Cu-MT were reduced by the combination of BC with RCG and/or HTCG, whereas individual application of RCG slightly increased the Cu, Cd, and Zn leaching and bioavailability, compared to the unamended Cu-MT. Sequential extractions results showed a reduction in the exchangeable fraction of Cu, Cd, Pb, and Zn and elevation in the residual fraction following the addition of BC-2% and BC-HTCG. However, individual application of RCG slightly increased the Cu, Cd, and Zn exchangeable fractions assessed by chemical extraction method. Rapeseed was grown for the following 45 days during which physiological parameters, metal uptake transfer rate (TR), bioconcentration factor (BCF), and translocation factor (TF) were measured after harvesting. In the case of plant biomass, no significant difference between applied amendments was observed for the fresh biomass (FBM) and dry biomass (DBM) of shoots and roots of rapeseed. However, BC-2% and BC-HTCG presented the lowest HMs uptake, TR, BCF (BCFroot and BCFshoot), and TF for Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn in rapeseed among the other amendments compared to the unamended Cu -MT. Overall, these findings are indicative that using biochar in combination with RCG and/or HTCG led to a larger reduction in HMs leaching and bioavailability, due to their higher sorption capacity and could be a suitable remediation strategy for heavy metals in a Cu-MT.

AB A novel green approach was utilized to fabricate sulfur nanoparticles (SNPs) with the aid of Ocimum basilicum leaves extract. The effective formation of the synthesized SNPs was examined and approved using UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The average particle size was 23 nm with spherical shape and crystalline in nature. In the pot experiment, the synthesized SNPs were applied with different concentrations (12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 mu M) as pre-soaking to Helianthus annuus seeds and irrigated with 100 mM MnSO4. As a result of manganese (Mn) exposure, the harvested 14-day sunflower seedlings showed a significant decline in the growth parameters (shoot length, leaf area and the relative water content of both shoot and root), photosynthetic pigments, mineral content (N, P, K, Ca, and Mg), and protein content compared to the control. The root length, electrolyte leakage, Na and Mn levels, metabolites content (amino acids, protein, glycine betaine, praline, and cysteine) were greatly raised as affected by Mn stress. Mn toxicity reduction using SNPs was demonstrated, as the medium doses enhanced seedlings growth, photosynthetic pigments, and mineral nutrients. Application of SNPs decreased Mn uptake and enhanced S metabolism through increasing cysteine level. Likewise, SNPs elevated seedlings water content and eliminated physiological drought via increasing osmolytes such as amino acids and praline. It can be concluded that green-synthesized SNPs had the potential to limit the deleterious effects of Mn stress.

AB In aquatic organisms, dietary exposure to nanomaterials is not only one of the important uptake pathways, but it is also one method to assess the transmission risk of the food chain. To address this concern, we quantitatively investigated the accumulation and depuration of fullerenols in the tissues of zebrafish after exposure to fullerenols-contaminated Daphnia magna. After exposure to C-13-labelled fullerenol solution at a concentration of 2.5 mg/L for 72 h, the steady state concentration of fullerenols in D. magna was 31.20 +/- 1.59 mg/g dry weight. During the 28 d uptake period for zebrafish, fullerenols in the tissues increased in a tissue-and day-dependent manner, and the major target tissues of fullerenols were the intestines and liver, followed by the gill, muscle, and brain. The kinetic parameters of uptake and depuration were also quantitatively analyzed. After depuration for 15 d, a certain amount of residual fullerenols remained in the tissues, especially the brain, where approximately 64 d may be needed to achieve 90% of the cumulative concentration depuration. The calculated distributionbased trophic transfer factors (TTFd values) (from 0.26 to 0.49) indicated that the tissue biomagnification of fullerenols by zebrafish through dietary exposure may not occur. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the presence of fullerenols in D. magna and the tissues of zebrafish. Our research data are essential for thoroughly understanding of the fate of nanoparticles through the dietary exposure pathway and directing future tissue bioeffect studies regarding target tissues for further research.

AB Effort has been made to standardise regulatory ecotoxicity tests for engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), but the environmental realism of altered water quality and/or pulse exposure to these pollutants should be considered. This study aimed to investigate the relative toxicity to early life-stage zebrafish of CuO ENMs at acid pH and then under pulse exposure conditions, all compared to CuSO4. At all pH values, CuSO4 was more toxic to zebrafish than CuO ENMs. Additions of H+ were protective of CuSO4 toxicity, with median lethal concentrations LC50 (with 95% confidence intervals) of: 0.36 (0.33-0.40), 0.22 (0.20-0.24) and 0.27 (0.25-0.29) mg L-1 at pH 5, pH 6 and pH 7, respectively. In contrast, the toxicity of CuO ENMs increased with acidity; LC50 values were: 6.6 (4.5-8.5), 19.4 (11.6-27.2) and > 100 mg L-1 at pH 5, pH 6 and pH 7, respectively. The increased toxicity of the CuO ENMs in acid water corresponded with greater dissolution of dissolved Cu from the particles at low pH, suggesting free Cu2+ ion delivery to the zebrafish was responsible for the pH-effect. In continuous 96 h exposures to the substances at the LC10 values and at pH 6, both CuSO4 and CuO ENMs caused Cu accumulation, inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase and depletion of total glutathione in zebrafish. However, two 24 h pulses of CuSO4 or CuO ENMs at the same peak concentration caused similar effects to the continuous 96 h exposure, despite the shorter exposure durations of the former; suggesting that the pulses were more hazardous than the continuous exposure. In conclusion, the current water quality correction for pH with respect to Cu toxicity to freshwater fish should not be applied to the nano form. Crucially, CuO ENMs are more toxic in pulse than continuous exposure and new corrections for both water pH and the Cu exposure profile are needed for environmental risk assessment.

AB Earthworm provides sustainability towards the agroecosystem which can be degraded day by day by the extensive use of pesticides (e.g., fungicides, insecticides and herbicides). The present study attempts to develop a predictive quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model for toxicity of pesticides to earthworm in order to give a suitable guidance for designing new analogues with lower toxicity by exploring the important chemical features which are required to develop safer alternatives. The QSAR model was developed by using the negative logarithm of lethal concentration (pLC(50)) values of pesticides towards earthworm. We have used various 2D descriptors along with extended topochemical atom (ETA) indices as independent variables for the development of the model. The developed partial least squares (PLS) model was subjected to statistical validation tests proving that the model is statistically reliable and robust (R-2 = 0.765, Q(2) = 0.614, Q(F1)(2) = 0.734, Q(F2)(2) = 0.713). The contributing descriptors in the model suggested that the pesticides may affect the earthworm nucleic acid through various physicochemical interactions including hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, electron donor acceptor complex formation, pi-pi stacking interaction and charge transfer complex formation.

AB There is a data gap on occurrence and transport of antibiotics in river-estuary system, with limited understanding of their impact on aquatic environment. To gain insight into the antibiotic pollution in river-estuary system, 22 surface sediments and 5 wetland plants from Yang River and its estuary in Jiaozhou Bay were selected to explore the occurrence and transport of eight quinotone antibiotics (QNs), and their impacts on aquatic environment. Our results indicated that QNs were widely present in the sediments from Yang River and its estuary, with a range of 1.34-8.69 ng/g (average 4.46 ng/g) in Yang River and 0.99-10.86 ng/g (average 3.92 ng/g) in its estuary, respectively. No obvious correlations were observed between QNs values and TOC contents in sediments from our study area, due to low detective concentrations and frequencies of QNs. The mass loading of individual antibiotic from Yang River to its estuary was from 11.73 to 391.59 g/year, far below those from the other estuarine regions all over the world. QNs were observed in all five wetland plants, demonstrating that QNs contaminants could be taken up by wetland plants and providing the evidence that phytoremediation could be a feasible way to remove contaminants. Negative partial coefficients between individual antibiotic and brassicasterol biomarker suggested the presence of QNs inhibited the phytoplankton growth. Evaluation of ecological risk based on the values of risk quotients (RQs) showed that OFL in Yang River displayed medium risk for algae, and CIP and OFL in its estuary also displayed medium risk value for plant and algae. The results could provide powerful basis on controlling river antibiotics pollution to enhance rivers-estuary security in similar regions.

AB Toxic metal pollution is a renowned environmental concern, especially to sensitive environments like school classrooms and their association with children's health. The study was planned to determine the pollution characteristics of 13 potentially toxic metal (oid)s (PTMs) and their associated children's health risk assessment from school dust samples of considerably three land-use types (residential, roadside, and industrial areas) of Lahore, Pakistan. Geo-accumulation (I-geo), pollution (PI), integrated pollution (IPI) and pollution load (PLI) indexes were used to determine the PTMs contamination and USEPA health risk assessment models were employed to assess the health risks in children. The mean concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn for three land use types were found much higher than the permissible limits. Results of pollution indices revealed that school dust was strongly contaminated with Cd, Pb, and Zn whilst moderately contaminated with Cr and Cu. Moreover, the health risk assessment models revealed no significant non-cancerous risks in children with predominantly highest hazardous index (HI) of Cr in industrial (4.61E-01) and Pb in both roadside (4.30E-01) and residential (2.26E-01) area schools. According to cumulative HI of all PTMs and exposure routes, the land-use areas were in descending order as industrial > roadside > residential. The calculations of hazardous quotient (HQ) showed ingestion was the leading pathway of PTMs exposure through school dust. For carcinogenic health risk (CR), the most prominent PTM was Cr with values of 1.53E-06 in industrial area schools, found close to the tolerable range (1.0E-06). Hence, school dust of Lahore prominently contaminated with eminent PTMs triggering slight health risks predominantly by ingestion exposure to children.

AB Ammonia nitrogen elevated is one of the commonest problem in the aquatic system, which caused a great threat to the survival and growth of prawn. However, little is know about the ammonia metabolism and detoxification strategy of prawn. In this study, the effects of ammonia-N (0, 0.108, 0.216, 0.324, or 0.54 mg L-1) on growth and metabolizing enzymes in hepatopancreas of Macrobrachium rosenbergii, including glutamine synthetase (GS), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), were investigated. The metabolome of its muscle was also analyzed after exposure to ammonia-N (0, 0.108, 0.324, or 0.54 mg L-1) for 20 days. The survival rate of M. rosenbergii decreased significantly after treatment with 0.54 mg L-1 ammonia-N compared with that in the other groups. However, ammonia-N had no significant effect on the growth of the river prawn after exposure for 20 days. GS activity increased significantly after exposure to 0.108 mg L-1 ammonia-N compared with the control and other ammonia-N-treated groups. Hepatopancreatic GDH activity was lower in the prawns treated with 0.216, 0.324, or 0.54 mg L-1 ammonia-N than in the control by 34.70%, 38.80%, or 41.94%, respectively. Ammonia-N had no significant effect on hepatopancreatic AST or ALT activity. Urea nitrogen was higher in the prawns treated with 0.216 mg L-1 ammonia-N than in the control or those treated with 0.54 mg L-1 ammonia-N. Ammonia-N had significant effects on the lipid, carbohydrate. and protein metabolism of M. rosenbergii, including purine metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, a-linolenic acid metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and phosphonate and phosphate metabolism, and on the terpenoid biosynthesis, lysine degradation, and lysine biosynthesis pathways. High concentrations of ammonia-N stress increased the content of glutamate and arginine, which may participate in the urea cycle, which synthesizes glutamine or urea to eliminate ammonia toxicity.

AB A large proportion (60-90%) of ingested tetracyclines are released to slurry, soils, surface waters and ground water, which has raised extensive concerns and may pose a risk to the soil ecosystem. A 56-day experiment was conducted to study the bioremediation by earthworms on soil microbial diversity and partial nitrification processes in oxytetracycline (OTC)-contaminated soil. The results showed that high OTC concentration significantly decreased the activity of soil bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA). Earthworms were found to accelerate the degradation efficiency and rate of OTC, and its main metabolites were 4-epi-oxytetracycline (EOTC) and 2-acetyl-2-decarboxamido-oxytetracycline (ADOTC). Earthworms had an important role in the bioremediation of soil microbial diversity by degrading OTC and its metabolite (EOTC), especially in the high OTC condition. Additionally, the results indicated that the effects of earthworms on the degradation of OTC could remediate the abundances of 16S rRNA and AOB amoA genes and the NO3- content in both low and high OTC-contaminated soils. The structural equation model suggested that earthworms could remediate the microbial diversity, the abundances of 16s rRNA and AOB amoA genes by accelerating the degradation of OTC, which contributed to the bioremediation by earthworms on soil microbial diversity and partial nitrification processes in oxytetracycline-contaminated soil.

AB Cadmium (Cd) is a dangerous environmental pollutant with high toxicity to plants. The adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase 2 (APR2) is the dominant APRs in Arabidopsis and plays an important role in reductive sulfate assimilation pathway. However, whether the involvement of plant APRs in Cd stress response is largely unclear. Herein, we report that APR2 functions in Cd accumulation and tolerance in Arabidopsis. The transcript levels of APR2 were markedly induced by Cd exposure. Transgenic plants overexpressing APR2 improved Cd tolerance, whereas knockout of APR2 reduced Cd tolerance. APR2-overexpressing plants with increased Cd accumulation and tolerance showed higher glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatin (PC) levels than the wild type and apr2 mutant plants, but lower H2O2 and TBARS contents upon Cd exposure. Moreover, exogenous GSH application effectively rescued Cd hypersensitivity in APR2-knockout plants. Further analysis showed that buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, an inhibitor of GSH synthesis) treatment completely eliminated the enhanced Cd tolerance phenotypes of APR2-overexpressing plants, implying that APR2-mediated enhanced Cd tolerance is GSH dependent. In addition, over-expression of the APR2 led to elevated expressions of the GSH/PC synthesis-related genes under Cd stress. Taken together, our results indicated that APR2 regulated Cd accumulation and tolerance possibly through modulating GSH-dependent antioxidant capability and Cd-chelation machinery in Arabidopsis. APR2 could be exploited for engineering heavy metal-tolerant plants in phytoremediation.

AB Nanoparticles (NPs) production is increasing worldwide. These products are likely to end up in aquatic environments. However, few studies evaluated the chronic toxicity of iron-based NPs (Fe-NPs) to cladocerans and their potential ecotoxicological hazards. In this study we aimed to investigate the effects of iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4-NPs) to Ceriodaphnia silvestrii Daday, 1902, assessing acute (48 h) and chronic toxicity (up to 14 d). Besides traditional endpoints (immobility and lethality), we also evaluated physiological responses (respiration rates) in a 48 h-exposure. No immobility was observed (EC50 > 100 mg L-1) after 48 h, whereas respiration rates at the highest concentration were 400% of that in control, indicating that this endpoint was more sensitive during acute toxicity. In chronic assays, Fe3O4-NPs affected body length (8.24% growth inhibition in 7 d-exposure) and number of eggs (7-d IC10: 3.53, IC20: 6.69 mg Fe L-1) and neonates (7-d IC10: 1.25, IC20: 3.75 mg Fe L-1). Based on species sensitivity distribution (SSD), C. silvestrii was a sensitive organism, suggesting Fe-NPs as a possible threat for this species. Our results also indicate that the NPs caused a physical barrier, impairing food absorption, since we observed NPs agglomerations into cladocerans' gut. We demonstrate that Fe3O4-NPs affects C. silvestrii metabolism and reproduction and our results support the use of sublethal endpoints to assess environmental safety. The release of these NPs into freshwater environments should be carefully evaluated, since disturbances on cladoceran population dynamics could cause strong impacts on the entire food web structure and ultimately on ecosystem functioning.

AB Although the acute and/or chronic exposure to AFB(1) has been widely investigated, the study on the toxic effects resulted from the subchronic exposure of AFB(1) which is more close to the real scenario in view of the regional and seasonal characters of aflatoxin-producing strains is still limited. To understand the subchronically toxic effects of AFB(1), we studied the AFB(1)-induced oxidative damage, reproductive impairment as well as their potential correlations and mechanisms at the molecular level. Generally, our results showed that subchronic exposure of AFB(1) gave rise to pathological and oxidative damages in mice, disrupted oxidation-reduction homeostasis, activated mitochondrial apoptotic and p53-regulated signaling pathways, induced DNA and chromosomal damages and increased the rate of sperm malformation. Importantly, reproductive toxic effects were detected in AFB(1)-treated mice under a subchronic exposure, which was evidenced by the ascended sperm malformation. Based on our pilot study, it's speculated that the partial mechanism of reproductive toxicity may be the oxidative damages, especially DNA damages directly induced by AFB(1). In short, our study demonstrated that severe damages can be caused even by a subchronic exposure as well as hinted that reproductive toxicity also should be taken into consideration when conducting risk assessments of the subchronic exposure of AFB(1).

AB Cadmium (Cd) affects crop growth and productivity by disrupting normal plant metabolism. To determinate whether ultrasonic (US) seed treatment can alleviate Cd stress in rape (Brassica napus L.), the seeds of two oilseed rape cultivars i.e., 'Youyanzao18' and 'Zaoshu104' were exposed to ultrasonic waves for 1 min at 20 KHz frequency. Seeds without US treatment were taken as control (CK). Results revealed that the germination rate of both cultivars was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in US treatment than CK only at 0 and 10 mg Cd L-1. The shoot and root length of both cultivars were significantly higher in US treatment than CK at all Cd treatments except the root length of Youyanzao18 at 50 mg Cd L-1. The fresh weight Youyanzao18 was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in US than CK except for Youyanzao18 at 25 mg Cd L-1. Moreover, the superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities and the proline, glutathione (GSH), and soluble protein contents in Youyanzao18 were relatively higher in the US treatment than CK. The malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were prominently reduced in US treatment than CK. The pods per plant, seeds per pod and rapeseed yield were increased by 15.9, 11.4, and 16.4% in Youyanzao18 and 10.3, 9.5, and 11.5% in Zaoshu104, respectively in US treatment, compared to CK. Moreover, the contents of Cd in root, stem, leaf, rape pod shell, and rapeseeds were comparatively less in US treatment than CK whereas the Cd concentrations in different plant parts of both rape cultivars were recorded as: leaf root stem rape pod shell rapeseed. In sum, the US treatment improved the morphological growth and rapeseed yield whereas reduced the Cd accumulation in different plant parts of rapeseed under Cd contaminated soil.

AB Biotests like the fish embryo toxicity test have become increasingly popular in risk assessment and evaluation of chemicals found in the environment. The large range of possible endpoints is a big advantage when researching on the mode of action of a certain substance. Here, we utilized the frequently used model organism zebrafish (Danio rerio) to examine regulative mechanisms in the pathway of the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in early development. We exposed embryos to representatives of two chemical classes known to elicit dioxin-like activity: benzo[a]pyrene for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 2,3-benzofuran for polar O-substituted heterocycles as a member of heterocyclic compounds in general (N-, S-, O-heterocycles; NSO-hets). We measured gene transcription of the induced P450 cytochromes (cyp1), their formation of protein and biotransformation activity throughout the whole embryonic development until 5 days after fertilization. The results show a very specific time course of transcription depending on the chemical properties (e.g. halogenation, planarity, K-ow), the physical decay and the biodegradability of the tested compound. However, although this temporal pattern was not precisely transferable onto the protein level, significant regulation in enzymatic activity over time could be detected. We conclude, that a careful choice of time and end point as well as consideration of the chemical properties of a substance are fairly important when planning, conducting and especially evaluating biotests.

AB Bisphenol A (BPA) is an artificial xenoestrogen widely used in consumer products containing polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Exposure to BPA occurs through various channels, including ingestion of contaminated food and water. Autophagy is an important catabolic pathway that plays an important role in liver lipid metabolism. Evidence suggests that BPA exposure causes abnormal lipid droplet accumulation in liver, but the mechanism remains unknown. Here, we investigate the function of BPA in lipid metabolism and autophagy. BPA exposure increases lipid droplet and ROS accumulation which is accompanied by a defect in the fusion of the autophagosome to the lysosome. BPA exposure decreases the translocation of Stoc17 to lysosome resulting in the autophagogome-lysosome fusion defect. There is no defect in the formation of the autophagosome indicated by increased LC3-II, p62 level, GFP/mRFP-LC3 ratios and decreased colocalization between LAMP2 with LC3. Mechanistically, BPA exposure reduces autophagy SNARE complex formation. Promoting autophagy by autophagy inducer (Torin2) partially reverses lipid droplet accumulation caused by BPA exposure. In summary, our results demonstrate BPA exposure inhibits autophagy resulting in decreased lipid droplet degradation and increased ROS levels. These results also provide a novel implication between autophagosome-lysosome fusion.

AB In ecological risk assessment, the Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) of a substance is generally derived by one of two methods: either by applying an Assessment Factor (AF) or by using a Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD). With the AF method, which is the conventional way, the PNEC is determined by dividing the lowest No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) by an AF of a certain fixed magnitude. With the SSD method, which is becoming increasingly used in the European Union and the United States, an HC5 value (Hazardous Concentration for 5% of species) is estimated from the NOEC and then divided by an AF to derive the PNEC. This study aimed to explore the most appropriate AF and the most effective application of each method. The performances of the SSD and AF methods were compared on the assumption that the better method is that in which more PNECs are lower than HC5. We concluded that the performance of these methods depends on sample size and variation in species sensitivity. As the sample size increases (i.e., if there are more toxicity data), the performance of each method increases. The performance of the AF method is better when variation in species sensitivity is small (i.e., all species tend to have a similar NOEC), but it declines as variation in sensitivity rises, implying that persisting with either of the methods may misrepresent the ecological risk. Our results suggest that the variation in sensitivity is an important factor affecting the ecological risk and more effort should be paid to understanding why the variation varies depending on chemical substances.

AB It is well established that arsenic (As) pollution has a severe threat to food security and soil non-target organisms, however, its influences on soil fauna gut microbiota are poorly understood. The gut microbiota of soil fauna play an important role in host health and nutrient cycling. Here, we used dietary exposure to investigate the effects of As on the mortality and gut microbiota of two model soil collembolans (Folsomia candida and Onychiurus yodai) and determine the accumulation of As in collembolan body tissues. The results showed that, although As exposure did not induce the mortality of the two species, dose dependence of As accumulation was indeed detected in their body tissues. Oral As exposure (500 mu g g(-1) yeast) significantly altered the community structure (P < 0.05) of F. candida gut microbiota and reduced its diversity (by more than 20%; P < 0.05) compared to the control; however, no significant effects were observed in O. yodai gut microbiota. The two collembolan species possess significantly different gut microbiota (P < 0.05), which may partly explain the differences of the two collembolan gut microbiota response to As exposure. We further found that the genera Ochrobactrum, Geobacter and Staphylococcus were sensitive to As exposure in F. candida (P < 0.05), but these bacteria were low abundance and not altered in O. yodai. Moreover, the relative abundance of these bacteria was significantly correlated with As bioaccumulation in F. candida body tissues (P < 0.05, R-2 > 0.6). Higher As bioaccumulation factor was also found in O. yodai body tissues compared to the F. candida. These results indicate that collembolan gut microbiota present a species-specific response to As and may be a more sensitive indicator than the mortality of collembolan.

AB This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of integrons and associated gene cassettes in Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolates from waterfowls in Hainan, China. The antimicrobial resistance profile of the isolates was examined by using disc diffusion test. In addition, PCR, RFLP, plasmid replicon typing and DNA sequencing analyses were used for the characterization of integrase genes (class 1, 2 and 3) and associated gene cassettes. Approximatively, 90% of the isolates were positive for the integrase genes by PCR. Specifically, class 1 and class 2 integrons were found in 252 (81%) and 7 (2.3%) strains, respectively. While 21 (6.7%) isolates were positive for both class 1 and class 2 integrons. However, none of the isolate was positive for the class 3 integrons. In addition, 5 various cassette arrays, dfrA1-orfC, aadA2, aadA1, dfrA1-aadA1, and dfrA1-orfC- aadA1, were found within the variable regions (VRs) of class 1 integron isolates. While only single cassette array, dfrA1-sat2-aadA1, was identified within VRs of class 2 integron isolates. We identified incF plasmid as the most common plasmid type, which was detected in 81 of 243 VRs containing isolates. This study is the first report showing the baseline characteristics of integrons in E. coil isolates from waterfowls in Hainan, China. Our results provide evidence of the waterfowl birds as a reservoir of class 1 and class 2 integrons carrying antibiotic resistance gene cassettes. Therefore, strict preventive measures should be taken to avoid the spread of mobile genetic resistance elements in waterfowls in China.

AB Organochlorine pesticides have been banned for many years, but the residual trace amount of organochlorine in water may still pose ecotoxicological risk. Meanwhile, the potential risk of organochlorine pesticides released from sediments, especially into drinking water sources, is receiving increasing attention. The present study assessed the pollution and potential risk of drinking water sources along the midstream and downstream Yangtze River. Residues of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in water, suspended particle matter (SPM), and sediment were evaluated with isotope dilution HRGC/HRMS. The results indicated that OCPs in water, SPM, and sediment ranged in 0.52-92.97 ng/L, 0.10-4.10 ng/L, and 0.038-11.36 ng/g, respectively. The predominant OCPs in water, SPM, and sediment were beta-HCH,p,p'-DDE and PeCB. At site Y1, 8, 13, 18, beta-HCH has a higher proportion in sediment samples, while, alpha-HCH has a higher proportion in SPM samples. The industrial use of HCHs in the history was the main HCHs source for most water and sediment samples, which indicated an absence of fresh inputs of industrial HCHs. Meanwhile, the abundance of p,p'-DDE in water, sediment and SPM samples could be attributed to long-term aerobic degradation of DDTs. The values of ffsw of HCHs, DDTs and PeCB indicate the transfer from water to sediment. Risk assessment showed that HCHs and DDTs posed low ecotoxicological risk to the Yangtze River.

AB Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) as potential neurotoxicants in environment may possess hazards to human health. Previous studies have reported that PBDEs exposure could induce oxidative stress and disturb mitochondrial functions in mammalian cells. However, the toxicological mechanism remains to be clarified. In this work, the neurotoxic effect and underlying mechanism of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) was investigated by using human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells as an effective model. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics approach combined with cell viability assay was applied to elucidate the metabolic perturbations and relevant toxicological pathways upon BDE-47 exposure. Our results shown that the SK-N-SH cell viability decreased in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to BDE-47 at 24 h within the concentration range of 5-250 mu M, and an IC50 value of 88.8 mu M was obtained. Based on the dose-response curve and cell morphological observation, the 5 and 10 mu M BDE-47 doses (equal to IC5 and IC10, respectively) were used for metabolomics study to capture the sensitive metabolic response following BDE-47 exposure. After BDE-47 treatment, nine metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers, and the most disturbed metabolic pathways were mainly involved in alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, glutathione metabolism, tyrosine and phenylalanine metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism, which imply that metabolic changes related to neurotransmitters, oxidative stress, and nucleotide-mediated signal transduction systems were the sensitive pathways mostly influenced. Our findings reported here may provide potential neurotoxic effect biomarkers and prompt deep understanding of the molecular and metabolic mechanisms triggered by BDE-47 exposure.

AB Irgarol 1051 is highly toxic to marine autotrophs and has been widely used as an antifouling booster biocide. This study tested the toxicities of two s-triazine derivatives of Irgarol, namely M2 (3-[4-tert-butylamino-6-methylthiol-s-triazin-2-ylamino]propionaldehyde) and M3 (2-methylthio-4,6-bis-tert-butylamino-s-triazine) to two marine diatom species, Skeletonema costatum and Thalassiosira pseudonana through standard acute (96h) and chronic (7d) growth inhibition tests. Results showed that both of the two chemicals significantly inhibited the growth of S. costaturn (M2: 96h-EC50 = 6789.7 mu gL(-1), 7d-EC50 = 3503.7 mu g L-1; M3: 96h-EC50 = 45193.9 mu g L-1, 7d-EC50 = 5330.0 mu g L-1) and T. pseudonana (M2: 96h-EC50 = 366.2 mu g L-1, 7d-EC50 = 312.5 mu g L-1; M3: 96h-EG50 = 2633.4 mu g L-1, 7d-EC50 = 710.5 mu g L-1), while their toxicity effects were much milder than Irgarol and its major degradation product Ml. By comparing with previous findings, the susceptibilities of these s-triazine compounds to two tested species were ranked as: Irgarol > M1 >> M2 > M3. This study promotes future research efforts on better understanding of the ecotoxicities of M2 and M3, and incorporating such information to improve the current monitoring, risk assessment and regulation of the use of Irgarol.

AB N-acetylcysteine (N-Acetyl L-cysteine, NAC) is a thiol compound derived from the addition of the acetyl group to cysteine amino acid. NAC has been used as an antioxidant, free radical scavenger, and chelating agent for reducing the deleterious effects on plants of biotic and abiotic environmental stresses. It can also relieve heavy metal (HM) toxicity, although its alleviating mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we compared HM-stressed (Cu, Hg, Cd and Pb, 100 mu M each) wheat seedlings without NAC treatment and in combination with NAC (1 mM). In comparison to HMs alone, NAC treatment in combination with HMs (Cu, Cd, Hg and Pb, respectively) stimulated root growth (1.1-, 1.5-, 10.5- and 1.9-fold), and significantly increased fresh (1.3-, 1.5-, 4.3- and 1.4-fold) and dry (1.2-, 1.5-, 2.5- and 1.2-fold) mass. Combination treatment also led to significant reductions in HM concentrations (1.3-, 1.4-, 4- and 1.1-fold, respectively). GSH (1.1 - 1.8-fold), TBARS (1.4 - 2.7-fold) and H2O2 (1.6 - 1.8-fold) contents in treatment with HMs alone were significantly mitigated by the NAC combination. Some of the antioxidant enzyme activities increased or reduced by some HM treatments alone were stimulated by a combination of NAC with HMs, or remained unchanged or changed only insignificantly, supported by the phenolic pool of the plant. Ferulic, p-comaric and syringic acids were the major phenolic acids (PAs) in the roots in free, ester, glycoside and ester-bound forms, and their concentrations were increased by HM treatments alone, in comparison to the control seedlings, while PAs concentrations were relatively reduced by NAC in combination with HMs. These results indicate that NAC can alleviate HM toxicity and improve the growth of HM-stressed wheat seedlings by coordinated induction of the phenolic pool and the antioxidant defence system.

AB DEHP is reported to cause precocious puberty of females in both humans and rodents, but the underlying mechanisms were largely unknown. This study was designed to clarify the effects and the mechanisms of DEHP on the pathogenesis of sexual precocity. Prepubertal female rats were treated with DEHP for 4 weeks. Key organs were analyzed in control conditions and after exposure to 0.2, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day DEHP in pubertal female rats. To determine the role of the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in DEHP-induced female precocious puberty, 36 rats were treated with 5 mg/kg/day DEHP to establish a model of female precocious puberty. And we investigated the expression of genes and proteins related to IGF-1 pathway in rat hypothalamus after treatment with inhibitors. In the present study, we observed that DEHP treatment resulted in earlier vaginal opening time, higher number of Nissl bodies in the hypothalamus neurons, lower apoptosis of hypothalamic cells, higher IGF-1 and GnRH levels in the serum and hypothalamus. DEHP could also upregulated the expression of IGF-1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and GnRH in the hypothalamus of adolescent female rats, and inhibition of IGF-1R and mTOR in hypothalamus could block the activation of Kiss-1, GPR54, and GnRH by DEHP. In summary, our study suggested that DEHP might activate the hypothalamic GnRH neurons prematurely through the IGF-1 signaling pathway and promote GnRH release, leading to the initiation of female sexual development. Our results provide a new molecular mechanism underlying reproductive and developmental toxicity in pubertal female rats induced by DEHP.

AB Synthetic antimicrobials known as parabens, triclosan (TCS), and triclocarban (TCC) are emerging environmental contaminants. Limited studies on these contaminants have been conducted in coastal environments. In our study, parabens, their metabolites, TCS, and TCC were measured in sediment collected along the Korean coast, to investigate contamination status, spatial distribution, and potential health risks to coastal environments. Methyl paraben and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid were detected in all sediment samples, suggesting widespread contamination. Total concentrations of parent parabens, their metabolites, TCS, and TCC ranged from 0.19 to 11.2 (mean: 2.40) ng/g dry weight, 9.65 to 480 (mean: 120) ng/g dry weight, and < limit of quantification (LOQ)-6.10 (mean: 0.41) ng/g dry weight, and from < LOQ-41.0 (mean: 2.78) ng/g dry weight, respectively. The overall contamination of parabens and antimicrobials in sediment was different from that reported for persistent organic pollutants due to different contamination sources among chemical groups. Significant correlation was found among target contaminants in sediment, suggesting the existence of a common source. Total organic carbon (TOC) was significantly correlated with the concentrations of target contaminants, implying a major factor for coastal distribution of parabens and antimicrobials. The concentrations of parabens and TCS measured in sediment did not exceed a hazard quotient (HQ), implying low potential health risks associated with exposure to these contaminants. This is the first study to report the nationwide distribution of parabens, their metabolites, and antimicrobials in the coastal environments of Korea.

TI UCH-L1 mitigates neurotoxicity induced by ZnO particles via stabilizing

AB Our study determined the toxic effects of zinc oxide (ZnO) particles with different diameters on dopaminergic (DA) neurons, the role of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) for ZnO particles induced neurotoxicity, and corresponding molecular mechanisms. We constructed an in vitro cell injury model for DA neurons to analyze the cytotoxicity of ZnO particles using SH-SY5Y cells. Following cell viability assays and flow cytometry, we found that the cytotoxicity of ZnO particles was affected by particle size, time, and dose of exposure. For example, the toxicity of ZnO particles with 50 nm or 100 nm diameter was stronger than that of ZnO particles with 1000 nm diameter. Furthermore, ZnO particles exposure resulted in a significant decrease in UCH-L1 expression in SH-SY5Y; whereas UCH-L1 overexpression led to a significant increase in cell viability and a sharp decrease in ROS level. Western blotting and adenovirus transfection found that exposure to ZnO particles with different diameters all activate the NF-KB signaling in SH-SY5Y cells; whereas UCH-L1 over-expression resulted in increased levels of I kappa B alpha, an endogenous inhibitor of NF-kappa B signaling pathway. ZnO particles with different diameters all induced cytotoxicity in DA neurons, which may be related to the free Zn2+ in the suspension. Regarding the neurotoxic effect of ZnO particles, UCH-L1 protects against and/or alleviates neuronal damage, possibly by deubiquitination of the endogenous inhibitor, I kappa B alpha, which leads to activation of NF-kappa B signaling. Therefore, one possible mechanism for ZnO particle induced neurotoxicity may be mediated via the down regulation of UCH-L1 expression in DA cells.

AB Crops can become contaminated when grown in soils containing heavy metals. Cadmium is a heavy metal that poses a significant health risk to humans. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cadmium on lettuce (Lactuca saliva Linn) and the contamination risk of lettuce grown in cadmium environments. The results showed that photosynthesis and growth parameters were significantly affected by cadmium. Lettuce has the ability to absorb large amounts of cadmium from the contaminated environment and so is a cadmium hyper-accumulator plant. The study showed that approximately 35% of the total absorbed cadmium is transmitted to aerial and edible parts of lettuce. This study was undertaken as lettuce has the ability to absorb and accumulate high levels of cadmium. There are however are no reports on the PCS gene and the potential for high cadmium accumulation in lettuce. The bioinformatics study revealed that lettuce has two phytochelatin synthase genes that produce 6 PCSs through splicing leading to the ability of lettuce to store high levels of cadmium. These six sequences although different in length have high similarity. Sequence structure, cellular location, three-dimensional structure, phylogeny and a comparison of their catalytic power were evaluated. The high accumulation of cadmium in lettuce and the presence of several PCSs contribute to the accumulation of cadmium in aerial tissues. The cultivation of lettuce in contaminated environments led us to evaluate suspected farms for the presence of cadmium in produce. Lettuce grown in industrial environments contaminated with cadmium can pose a serious threat to human health.

AB Ammonia is a major aquatic environmental pollutants. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of ammonia-induced toxicity is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the physiological response and molecular mechanism in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) exposed to the acute total ammonia (30 mg L-1) for 48 h. The results shown that ammonia exposure induced oxidative stress, and subsequently led to cytological damage and DNA damage. Transcriptome analysis was applied to investigate the key genes and pathways involved in the responses to ammonia exposure. A total of 722 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (526 up regulated and 196 down-regulated) were identified. DEGs mainly involved in pathways including metabolism, cellular processes, signal transduction and immune functions. Additionally, transcriptome analysis revealed that ATM/p53-Caspase3 pathway involved in apoptosis induced by ammonia stress. These results provided a new insight into the mechanism of the potential toxic effects of ammonia on crustaceans.

AB Epidemiological and experimental studies have indicated that ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure is associated with the occurrence and development of metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the mechanism is not clear yet, and there are few studies to explore the possible prevention measure. In this study, C57BL/6 and db/db mice were exposed to concentrated PM2.5 or filtered air using Shanghai Meteorological and Environmental Animal Exposure System (Shanghai-METAS) for 12 weeks. From week 11, some of the mice were assigned to receive a subcutaneous injection of AMPK activator (AICAR). Lipid metabolism, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis were measured. Meanwhile, the respiratory, systemic and visceral fat inflammatory response was detected. The results showed that PM2.5 exposure induced the impairments of glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, lipid metabolism disorders and disturbances of energy metabolism in both C57BL/6 and db/db mice. These impairments might be consistent with the increased respiratory, circulating and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) inflammatory response, which was characterized by the release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in lung, serum and VAT. More importantly, AICAR administration led to the significant enhancement of energy metabolism, elevation of AMPK as well as the decreased IL-6 and TNF-alpha in VAT of PM2.5-exposed mice, which suggesting that AMPK activation might attenuate the inflammatory responses in VAT via the inhibition of MAPK5 and NE kappa B. The study indicated that exposure to ambient PM2.5 under the concentration which is often seen in some developing countries could induce the occurrence of metabolic disorders in normal healthy mice and exacerbate metabolic disorders in diabetic mice. The adverse impacts of PM2.5 on insulin sensitivity, energy homeostasis, lipid metabolism and inflammatory response were associated with AMPK inhibition. AMPK activation might inhibit PM2.5-induced metabolic disorders via inhibition of inflammatory cytokines release. These findings suggested that AMPK activation is a potential therapy to prevent some of the metabolic disorders attributable to air pollution exposure.

AB A novel platform to perform systematic analysis and direct reading of root elongation bioassays is presented. The device was designed to include multiplexed microenvironments for the germination and growth of individual seeds, which allows observation by the naked eye or by optical systems, notably cellphone cameras. Prototypes were fabricated by laser micromachining on a highly transparent material that is fully compatible with biological systems. The effectiveness of the milli-channel array was verified against the conventional system (Petri-dish). Lactuca sativa was chosen as a model species and glyphosate as a typical toxic agent. All tests were run according to standardized procedures and data analysis was carried out through different statistical indicators such as the root elongation and germination indexes. Results attained in the milli-channel array were identical to those in Petri dish, with the remarkable benefit that several steps required in the conventional system were avoided, which enormously decreases the operation time and the possibility of experimental errors. Further advantages of the milli-channel array are also reported, such as the capability to achieve live imaging of plant organs growth through a simple experiment. The developed device has been proven to be effective, versatile, easy-to-use, and integrable to cellphones, which naturally provide facilities for data recording, analysis, and networking. These improvements open the route to novel applications of bioassays in the wide field of ecotoxicology and environmental studies.

AB Flavonoids are natural polyphenolic compounds from plants. As a new biotechnological algaecide, the molecular mechanism of plant flavonoids on the inhibition of Microcystis aeruginosa is still unknown. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the variation of expressions of photosynthesis-related genes, microcystin synthesis-related genes and the genes involved in N and P acquisition in M. aeruginosa under the flavonoids stress. The results showed that the expression of psbD1, psaB and rbcL related to photosynthesis were influenced by three flavonoids but with different changing tendencies. The transcription of mcyA, mcyD and mcyH related to microcystin synthesis were decreased after 5-d of exposure, which could block microcystin synthesis. Meanwhile, flavonoids treatments resulted in the inhibition of N and P acquisition related genes transcription to affect the absorption of N and P in algal cells, and further influenced the physiological metabolic process of M. aeruginosa.

AB Wide use of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) as white pigments induces unintentionally release in environment which increases concerns about their adverse health effects on respiratory system. So it is crucial to get a deep understanding of the disease process and molecular mechanism. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, have been found to play a role in the development of lung diseases by affecting expression of key genes. In addition, there could be potential different toxic effects of TiO2 NPs between young and adult. Thus, the comparative toxicity of TiO2 NPs in 5-week (young) and 10-week (adult) old NIH mice is investigated in this study following nasal inhalation of TiO2 NPs at dose of 20 mg/kg (body weight)/day for 30 days. Global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in lung were measured. Promoter methylation of inflammatory genes (IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) and tissue fibrosis gene (Thy-1) were determined. Additional, RNA-sequencing runs were performed on the pulmonic libraries. We found the induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis were more severe in young mice. Decreased global methylation and hydroxymethylation were only found in the young group. The altered methylation in promoter of TNF-alpha and Thy-1 were found to play a role in the inflammatory response and fibration. RNA-sequencing showed that in pathways in cancer expression of 197 genes was up-regulated in the young mice more that in the adult mice. All these results suggested that the young ages are more sensitive to TiO2 NP exposure and the potential of abnormal DNA methylation might be used as biomarkers of both exposure and disease development.

AB Rhizospheric and plant root associated microbes generally play a protective role against arsenic toxicity in rhizosphere. Rhizospheric microbial interaction influences arsenic (As) detoxification/mobilization into crop plants and its level of toxicity and burden. In the present investigation, we have reported a rhizospheric fungi Aspergillus flavus from an As contaminated rice field, which has capability to grow at high As concentration and convert soluble As into As particles. These As particles showed a reduced toxicity to soil dwelling bacteria, fungi, plant and slime mold. It does not disrupt membrane potential, inner/outer membrane integrity and survival of the free N-2 fixating bacteria. In arbuscular mycorrhiza like endophytic fungi Piriformospora indica, these As particles does not influence mycelial growth and plant beneficial parameters such as phosphate solubilizing enzyme rAPase secretion and plant root colonization. Similarly, it does not affect plant growth and chlorophyll content negatively in rice plant. However, these As particles showed a poor absorption and mobilization in plant. These As particle also does not affect attachment process and survival of amoeboid cells in slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum. This study suggests that the process of conversion of physical and chemical properties of arsenic during transformation, decides the toxicity of arsenic particles in the rhizospheric environment. This phenomenon is of environmental significance, not only in reducing arsenic toxicity but also in the survival of healthy living organism in arsenic-contaminated rhizospheric environment.

AB We report the synthesis, characterization, electrochemical sensing and catalytic capability of the bimetallic heterojunction Al2O3/ZnO micro flowers (AZ MFs). In order to prepare this bifunctional material, the facile hydrothermal process was adopted. The material was thoroughly characterized for the crystal structure and morphology with Powder XRD, XPS and FE-SEM. The investigation of electrochemical sensing was done using hydroquinone (HQ) and the chemical catalysis was using rhodamine B (RhB) with our bimetallic Al2O3/ZnO micro flowers as these are harmful industrial pollutants. The process parameters like the influence of scan rate and pH was efficiently optimized for the electrochemical detection of HQ and kinetics for the time dependent catalytic degradation of RhB dye. The linear relationship between the peak current and the concentration of HQ was found to be in the range of 0.125-20.25 mu M with an impressive detection limit of 11.2 nM. In the chemical catalytic degradation of the RhB dye, our bimetallic material thrived well during the reaction and degraded the material in 10 min. The performance of bimetallic Al2O3/ZnO micro flowers towards HQ detection and RhB degradation shows good stability, reproducibility and it can be efficiently utilized to treat the environmental pollutants.

AB Bacteria have been applied for the bioremediation of cadmium-contaminated environment. Less is known about the bioaccumulation of high concentration of Cd over time under the oligotrophic environment. Burkholderia cepacia GYP1, which was isolated from multiple heavy metal contaminated farmland, was studied for its bioaccumulation mechanism of Cd under oligotrophic condition. GYP1 possessed highly accumulation capacity for cadmium reaching 116 mg Cd/g biomass (dry weight). ATR-FTIR, electron microscopy, flow cytometry along with subcellular fraction demonstrated that the uptake and distribution of cadmium varied with the increased amount of cadmium of GYP1 cell during the 7-day treatment time: the accumulation of cadmium was mainly on the outer membrane at the beginning (within 1 day), and the intracellular cadmium kept increased and held stable after 2 days, after that, the increased amount of cadmium mainly located extracellularly, related to the secreted EPS. Further mechanism analysis of bioaccumulation of Cd by GYP1 based on iTRAQ-based proteomics showed that Cd(II) could trigger the up-regulation of the Cd2+/Zn2+-exporting ATPase, type VI protein secretion systems, and glutathione-S-transferase that are related to cadmium response, which may contribute to maintain the intracellular cadmium homeostasis. In summary, the immobilization of Cd(II) by B. cepacia GYP1 contains three steps:(1) fast immobilization of Cd(II) on the cell surface coordinated with functional groups, (2) transport of Cd(II) to cells and accumulation in cytoplasm, and (3) efflux of intracellular Cd(II) depended on energy and the entrapped or adsorbed of extracellular Cd(II) by EPS. Our study provided the understanding of the cadmium accumulation process of B. cepacia GYP1 under oligotrophic condition, which would be helpful in bioremediation of natural cadmium contaminated environment.

AB Terrestrial ecosystems are exposed to various kinds of pollutants, including radionuclides. The honeybee, Apis mellifera, is commonly used in ecotoxicology as a model species for evaluating the effects of pollutants. In the present study, honeybees were irradiated right after birth for 14 days with gamma rays at dose rates ranging between 4.38 x 10(-3) and 588 mGy/d. Biological tissues (head, intestine and abdomen) were sampled at D3, D10 and D14. Ten different physiological markers involved in nervous (acetylcholinesterase (AChE)), anti oxidative (catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)), immune system (phenoloxidase (PO)) and metabolism (carboxylesterases (CaEs) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) were measured. Univariate analyses were conducted to determine whether each individual biomarker response was positively or negatively correlated with the dose rate. Then, multivariate analyses were applied to investigate the relationships between all the biomarker responses. Although no mortality occurred during the experiment, several biomarkers varied significantly in relation to the dose rate. Globally, the biomarkers of antioxidant and immune systems decreased as the dose rate increased. Reversible effects on the indicator of the neural system were found. Concerning indicators of metabolism (carboxylesterases), variations occurred but no clear pattern was found. Taken altogether, these results help better understand the effects of ionizing radiation on bees by identifying relevant physiological markers of effects. These results could improve the assessment of the environmental risk due to ionizing radiation in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB In order to grow and effectively uptake and accumulate cadmium (Cd), plants used for phytoextraction have to cope with toxicity, which may be influenced by the supply of nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+). Thus, we evaluated the effect of these nitrogen forms on the photosynthetic and antioxidant enzyme activities of Panicum maximum cv. Tanzania (tanzania guinea grass) under Cd stress. Plants were grown in nutrient solution under greenhouse conditions and subjected to a 3 x 3 factorial experiment. They were supplied with three NO3-/NH4+ ratios (100/0, 70/30 and 50/50) and exposed to three Cd rates (0.0, 0.5 and 1.0 mmol L-1), being arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Gas exchange parameters, oxidative stress indicators, proline concentration and antioxidant enzyme activities were studied. Exposure to Cd reduced photosynthesis by causing stomatal closure and impairing electron transport. However, the simultaneous supply of NO3- and NH4+, particularly at a 50/50 ratio, restored gas exchange and improved the function of photo system II, increasing the photosynthetic capacity of the grass. Plants grown with 50/50 showed reduced lipid peroxidation along with increased proline synthesis. Moreover, this NO3+ /NH4+ ratio increased the tolerance of tanzania guinea grass to Cd by inducing high superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase activities in shoots and roots, respectively, maintaining cellular homeostasis and reducing oxidative stress. The negative effects of Cd on photosynthesis and on the balance between oxidants and antioxidants are attenuated by the partial replacement of NO3- by NH4+ in the nutrient solution.

AB A simple, sensitive and quick method for direct simultaneous chiral analysis of frequently used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ibuprofen, naproxen and flurbiprofen) in river water by HPLC-MS/MS was established and validated. Chromatographic parameters including the mobile phase composition, pH values, temperature and flow rates were optimized to obtain both satisfactory sensitivity and enantiomeric resolution (Rs >= 1.0), which suggested the composition and pH values of mobile phase played crucial influence on enantioseparations. The method demonstrated its superiority compared with previous studies regarding to the low MQLs (1.1-37.1 ng/L) and short runtime (< 20 min), enabling quantitative enantiomeric determination of trace level of emerging contaminants in water. The environmental monitoring of receiving water (34 sites along rivers) in Beijing revealed ibuprofen was the most abundant, with mean concentration of 114.9 ng/L and detection frequency of 91%, naproxen was also detectable at all sites from < MQL-43.2 ng/L, both presenting an excess of the S-(+)-enantiomer. Therefore to better understand the ecological risk posed from the trace organic contaminants on the aquatic organisms, chiral pollutants need analyzed at the enantiomeric levels. This is the first to profile the enantiospecific occurrence of NSAIDs in surface water in Beijing, China. It could provide useful information on environmental behaviors of chiral pollutants and facilitate more accurate environmental risk assessment.

AB Benzalkonium compounds are widely used and found in environmental samples. Due to their amphiphilic nature, it is important to know sorption coefficients to account their bioavailability. However, currently available models describing their partitioning were developed using low molecular weight homologues and it cannot be ascertained whether they are applicable to their higher molecular weight homologues. Reasons for the scarcity of data on highly sorptive compounds include the lack of reliable quantification techniques for analyzing these chemicals at environmentally relevant levels. This study, therefore, reports on an algal growth inhibition assay-based method for the determination of kaolinite/water distribution coefficients for benzalkonium compounds at their environmentally relevant concentration range. Sorption to clay was computed using the difference between median effective concentration determined in a culture with kaolinite and that derived from a culture grown in standard medium. A kinetic model was used to account for uptake into algal cells and to calculate free concentrations. Due to the sensitivity of the algal species, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, it was possible to determine distribution coefficients below micromole per liter concentrations. The computed distribution coefficients showed a linear increase with number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain up to 14. The proposed bioassay-based method should be applicable to determine distribution coefficients for highly hydrophobic chemicals and ionic liquids at a concentration range lower than typical analytical limits.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a worldwide anti-epileptic drug, whose fate and migration can be greatly influenced by contact with dissolved organic matter (DOM). The properties of DOM in road runoff can be greatly changed by grassy swale (GS) treatment, which influences the complexation of CBZ with DOM. Spectroscopic techniques were employed to explore the different binding properties between CBZ and DOM, and to understand the migration and biogeochemistry of CBZ. The two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS)demonstrated that effluent DOM displayed more binding sites for CBZ than influent DOM, and the binding sequencing of CBZ with DOM fluorophores can be greatly influenced by GS treatment. The results also suggest that protein-like materials exhibit higher log K-M values than other fluorescent components, indicating that fluorescent protein-like materials play a crucial role in the biogeochemical behavior of CBZ. Meanwhile, the log K-M values showed a remarkable increase after GS treatment. GS treatment can also remove most fluorescent DOM, reducing the risk of CBZ in the water environment.

AB Wood ash is a beneficial fertilizer and liming agent in nutrient depleted soils, but it also contains considerable amounts of cadmium (Cd), which can be toxic to organisms in the environment. Therefore, risk assessments regarding utilization of wood ash is required. Here, we studied how wood ash (applied in doses equivalent to 0, 3 and 6 t ha(-1)) and Cd (applied in doses of 0, 10, 150, 300, 600, 1200 and 2000 mg kg(-1)) affected growth of the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The treatments were combined in a full factorial design. Wood ash alone greatly stimulated both soil respiration and growth of C. elegans, whereas Cd alone had a toxic effect. However, unrealistically high Cd levels were needed to severely affect growth of C. elegans and soil respiration, especially soil respiration was very resilient to Cd amendment. Ash addition decreased Cd toxicity to C. elegans, with an EC50 value of 390 mg Cd kg(-1) in the 3 t ash ha(-1) treatment, and an increase of EC50 to 1894 mg Cd kg(-1) in the 6 t ash ha-1 treatment. This is probably because ash increases the Cd sorption capacity of the soil, and thereby decreases the bio-availability of Cd. The results suggest that there is no acute toxic effect of Cd to nematodes associated with wood ash recycling; in fact, our results suggest that ash actually decrease Cd toxicity.

AB Understanding the distribution and sources of mercury (Hg) in the Tibetan Plateau is of great value to study the long-range transport of Hg. Herein, the total Hg (THg) concentrations and the isotopic compositions of mosses, conifer needles, and surface soils collected from both slopes of the Shergyla Mountain of Tibetan Plateau were analyzed. The contents of THg in samples (except mosses on the eastern slope) were significantly positively correlated with altitude in both the western and eastern slopes, possibly caused by topographic factors. In contrast, Delta Hg-199 in samples was significantly negatively correlated with altitude. On the basis of Hg isotopic compositions, atmospheric Hg-0 uptake was indicated as the primary accumulation pathway of Hg in mosses (Delta Hg-199: -0.12 +/- 0.09 parts per thousand, -0.26 - 0.00 parts per thousand, 1 SD, n = 10) and conifer needles (Delta Hg-199: -0.21 +/- 0.08 parts per thousand, -0.36- -0.11 parts per thousand, 1 SD, n = 9). Moreover, the contributing fractions of atmospheric Hg to Hg in surface soils (Delta Hg-199: -0.20 +/- 0.07 parts per thousand, -0.31 - -0.06 parts per thousand, 1 SD, n = 17) increased with altitude and accounted for an average of 87 +/- 9% in atmospheric sources. Due to the special geographic positions and environmental conditions of the Tibetan Plateau, the results of this study were essential for further understanding the long-range transport and global cycling of Hg.

AB Enrichment of potentially harmful elements in surface water results in ecological risk to the surrounding environment. Assessing the environmental risk of these elements is of great importance. In this study, surface water samples from 6 different subsidence water bodies in the Huainan coal mining area were collected. The concentrations of Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd, Co, Cr, V, Fe, Mn and Zn were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and those of As and Hg were analyzed by atomic fluorescence spectrometry. Then, human health risks through the ingestion and dermal contact pathways were assessed and analyzed on the basis of a Monte Carlo simulation. The mean and 95th percentile risks were reported. The results showed that the total carcinogenic risk values in every subsidence water body summed for Cr, Ni and As via two exposure pathways were greater than the maximum acceptable level (1 x 10(-4)), and Xinji'er water body had the highest carcinogenic risk. Among three elements, Ni was the highest contributor to carcinogenic risk. All non-carcinogenic health risk (hazard quotients) values except for one water area of Co (Xinji'er) were less than 1; however, the total non-carcinogenic health risks of two water bodies (Xinji'er, Xinjiyi) summed for all the elements based on mean concentrations were higher than 1. Xinji'er had the highest hazard index. The extent of the impacts of the total hazard quotients followed the order of Co > As > Cd > Hg > Pb > V > Fe > Ni > Mn > Zn > Cr. Furthermore, the total hazard quotients of Co and As via ingestion pathway summed for the six subsidence water areas were greater than 1, which should be a concern.

AB Portable monitors such as MicroPEM can accurately characterize personal exposure of pollutants, which is critical for linking exposure and health effects of air pollution. The RTI (RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) MicroPEM V3.2A provides both real-time fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations and time-integrated PM samples collected onto Teflon filters that can be used to correct real-time data as well as allow further lab chemical analysis of species on filters (e.g., metal, black carbon). Due to the optical reflectivity of local PM sources can be very different from available standard reference particles used for calibration by RTI, there is a need for gravimetric correction and validation at each study location. However, assessments of MicroPEM have been limited in locations with severe air pollution, such as Beijing. We selected a variety of weather and air quality conditions, including both clear and hazy days in Beijing, to compare PM2.5 data among MicroPEMs as well as between MicroPEM and other types of samplers. We also compared MicroPEM real-time PM2.5 concentrations with data from nearby fixed-sites. The results show MicroPEM performed well across a wide range of PM2.5 concentrations (6-461 mu g/m(3)) and MicroPEM data, after gravimetric correction, were consistent with those from moderate-volume samplers. Good agreement was also found between real-time data from MicroPEM and fixed-site data. The present study covered a wide range of pollution levels in actual environments and validated the usage of MicroPEM as a PM2.5 monitor in locations with elevated PM2.5 levels.

AB Rapid urbanisation in Malaysian cities poses risks to the health of residents. This study aims to estimate the relative risk (RR) of major air pollutants on cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalisations in Kuala Lumpur. Daily hospitalisations due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases from 2010 to 2014 were obtained from the Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz (HCTM). The trace gases, PM10 and weather variables were obtained from the Department of Environment (DOE) Malaysia in consistent with the hospitalisation data. The RR was estimated using a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) based on Poisson regression. A "lag" concept was used where the analysis was segregated into risks of immediate exposure (lag 0) until exposure after 5 days (lag 5). The results showed that the gases could pose significant risks towards cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalisations. However, the RR value of PM10 was not significant in this study. Immediate effects on cardiovascular hospitalisations were observed for NO2 and O-3 but no immediate effect was found on respiratory hospitalisations. Delayed effects on cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalisations were found with SO2 and NO2. The highest RR value was observed at lag 4 for respiratory admissions with SO2 (RR = 1.123, 95% CI = 1.045-1.207), followed by NO2 at lag 5 for cardiovascular admissions (RR = 1.025, 95% CI = 1.005-1.046). For the multi-pollutant model, NO2 at lag 5 showed the highest risks towards cardiovascular hospitalisations after controlling for O-3 8 h mean lag 1 (RR = 1.026, 95% CI = 1.006-1.047), while SO2 at lag 4 showed highest risks towards respiratory hospitalisations after controlling for NO2 lag 3 (RR = 1.132, 95% CI = 1.053-1.216). This study indicated that exposure to trace gases in Kuala Lumpur could lead to both immediate and delayed effects on cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalisations.

AB In this study, we estimated the toxicity risks from river sediments that were affected by multiple pollutants in the Haihe River Basin. We used a range of methods to determine the concentrations, bioavailability, and toxicity of a range of metals and contaminants in sediments and sediment porewater and then assessed the ecological risks and toxicity using various multivariate statistical approaches. We found that more than 70% of the samples were toxic. The concentrations of non-ionic ammonia (0.168-9.295 mg L-1) were generally high in the sediment porewater, while the concentrations of bioavailable chromium (Cr) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were also high in the porewater samples from NW01 and NW02, respectively. We used the toxic unit (TU) approach, based on the bioavailable pollutant concentrations, to determine the toxicity of PAHs, heavy metals, and non-ionic ammonia in river sediments and sediment porewater. We found that non-ionic ammonia was the main source of toxicity for Daphnia magna, and that Cr and zinc were toxic for Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Chironomus dilutus. By combining various indexes, we identified the main contributors to the toxicity in sediments collected from rivers affected by multiple pollutants.

AB Three marine microalgae were exposed to diethyl phthalate (DEP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) to investigate interactions between the algae and the pollutants. The 96-h 50% effect concentration (EC50) and no observed effect concentration (NOEC) based on cell density or chlorophyll a were in the order of Chaetoceros muelleri > Cylindrotheca closterium > Dunaliella sauna for DEP, and C. closterium > C. muelleri > D. saline for DBP, respectively. Besides, EC50 value for C. closterium based on cell density increased over time in general, exhibiting strong adaptive ability to the pollutants.
   When singly existed, DEP was degraded more quickly at environmental relevant concentration (0.1 mg L-1) than at concentration of >= EC20; DBP was degraded more quickly by C. closterium than by C. muelleri and D. saline. C. closterium was the most effective species to degrade the pollutants. When they were coexisted, degradation was inhibited by each other at environmental relevant concentration, while bioconcentration percentages of the pollutants increased, indicating that DEP-DBP mixture would be more problematic to marine organisms.

AB Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a widely used plasticizer, which is considered an endocrine disrupting pollutant. Growth kinetics and esterases activity by biochemical tests and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were characterized for Fusarium culmorum grown in DEHP-supplemented (1000 mg/L) medium as the only carbon source and in control medium with glucose. Intermediate compounds of biodegraded DEHP were identified by GC-MS. F. culmorum degraded 92% of DEHP within 36 h. DEHP was degraded to butanol, hexanal, catechol and acetic acid. It is suggested that the first two compounds would transform into butanediol and the last two would enter into the Krebs cycle and would be mineralized to CO2 and H2O. DEHP induced eight esterase isoforms, which were different to those constitutive isoforms produced in the control medium. It is suggested that five enzymes (25.7, 29.5, 31.8, 97.6 and 144.5 kDa) detected during the first 36 h be involved in the primary biodegradation of DEHP. The rest of the enzymes (45.9, 66.6 and 202.9 kDa) might be involved in the final steps for DEHP metabolism. F. culmorum has a promising practical application in the treatment of DEHP-contaminated environments because it can secrete specific esterase to breakdown high concentrations of DEHP in a short period of time. This research represents the first approach for the study of esterase involved in the DEHP degradation by fungi using this phthalate as the sole source of carbon and energy.

AB To assess the impacts of man-made extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) on soil ecosystems, the soil nematode was applied as a biological indicator to characterize ecotoxicity of ELF-EMF. In this paper, a soil-living model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) was exposed to 50 Hz, 3 mT ELF-EMF. The integrated lipidome, proteome and transcriptome analysis were applied to elucidate physiological acclimations. Lipidomic analysis showed that ELF-EMF exposure induced significant alterations of 64 lipids, including significant elevation of triacylglycerols (TGs). Proteome results implied 157 changed protein expressions under ELF-EMF exposure. By transcriptomic analysis, 456 differently expressed genes were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) function and pathway analyses showed lipidomic alteration, mitochondrial dysfunction and the stress defense responses following ELF-EMF exposure in C. elegans. Conjoint analysis of proteome and transcriptome data showed that a higher expression of genes (sip-1,mtl-1 and rpl-11.1, etc.) were involved in stress defense responses to ELF-EMF exposure. These results indicated that ELF-EMF can induce effects on soil nematodes, mainly through disturbing lipid metabolism such as increasing TGs content, and eliciting stress defense responses. This study provided a new understanding in ELF-EMF exposure effects on soil nematodes and suggested a potential way of interpreting ELF-EMF influences on soil ecosystems.

AB Halogenated bisphenol A analogues (X-BPA) have been widely used in industrial production, such as flame retardant. Although BPA exposure was found to result in cytotoxicity, toxicity of X-BPA and molecular mechanism remain under-explored. In this study, we employed human breast cancer cell as a model to investigate the concentration-dependent toxicity and underlying mechanisms of tetrabromo bisphenol A (TBBPA) and tetrachloro bisphenol A (TCBPA). An integrated method involving molecular toxicology and mass spectrometry (MS)-based global metabolomics was applied to evaluate the toxicity of TCBPA and TBBPA on cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and metabolic alterations. The results demonstrated that low micromolar levels (0-10 mu M) of TCBPA/TBBPA exposure induced cell proliferation and activated the energy metabolism of both glycolysis and amino acid. On the other hand, high micromolar levels (10-50 mu M) of TCBPA/TBBPA exposure perturbed the balance between ROS and antioxidative defense process by promoting the ROS generation via the down-regulation of glutathione biosynthesis and up-regulation of nucleotide metabolism. This study, for the first time, provides evidence and mechanism for better understanding the cytotoxicity of TCBPA and TBBPA by regulating the specific metabolic pathways.

AB In this study, levels of 14 organophosphate flame retardants (OPEs) were measured in 101 indoor dust samples collected from dormitories, residential homes, and offices in Beijing, China. In addition, paired air samples were also analyzed to evaluate any correlation between OPE levels in air and that in corresponding dust samples. The Sigma 14OPEs levels substantially varied between individual samples. Thereinto, significantly higher OPE levels were found in dust samples from office (mean value: 14 mu g g(-1)), comparing to that in dust samples from residential homes (mean value: 5.9 mu g g(-1)) and dormitories (mean value: 6.9 mu g g(-1)). Congener profiles of OPEs in dust samples from different microenvironments indicated that tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) was the dominant OPE in the office samples, followed by tris (2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCPP). In contrast, TCPP was the dominant OPE in the residential home and dormitory samples, followed by TCEP. The mean concentration (range) of Sigma 14OPEs in the 15 air samples was 5.2 (1.0-20) ng m(-3), and TCPP was the dominated congener in these samples. The concentration of TCEP and TCPP in air was positively correlated with that in corresponding indoor dust, and OPEs with highly saturated vapor pressures have higher fractions in the air than that in the dust. The estimated daily intakes through dust ingestion, dermal absorption, and inhalation indicated that the exposure to OPEs in indoor environments do not result in significant health risk for the general population in Beijing.

AB Despite the important ecosystem and hydrological roles of coastal and inland waters, there are no established biomonitoring protocols for evaluating environmental, wildlife and human health for these coastlines in Nigeria. In the present study, contaminants tissue burden and effects at molecular and physiological levels, were investigated in Tilapia guineensis from a man-made lake (Eleyele Lake) that is used for municipal domestic water supply and compared to a reference site (Igboho Lake). Gene expression of phase I and II biotransformation systems, oxidative stress and obesogen responses were analyzed using real-time PCR, and these results were related to general health index (condition factor: CF) and muscle burden of trace metals, aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We observed a significant increase in phase I and II biotransformation systems, oxidative stress and obesogen responses in male and female fish from Eleyele lake compared with the reference site. Overall, our data showed significant relationships between biological responses and tissue concentrations of metals and PAHs for the Eleyele lake compared with the reference site. Given that a positive influence on genes and pathways associated with metabolic status has been previously associated with peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs), xenobiotic compounds that activate PPARs may produce changes in energy and metabolic processes, leading to obesity. The high CF (> 1 = good health condition) observed, coupled with the high muscle burden of inorganic and organic contaminants in fish from Eleyele lake, suggest a potential obesogenic effect in these fishes. These findings represent co-relational evidence that the Eleyele lake is contaminated and consequently affecting biological and physiological integrity of organisms inhabiting the lake. These findings also suggest potential health risks for humans, since the lake is extensively used for domestic water supply and fisheries.

AB The current study aims to perform a field survey of three abandoned mining sites in the southern centre of Morocco to assess the recent metal pollution in soils and accumulation potential of plant species. Native plants and soils were sampled at several sites in the studied mines and analysed for Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd concentrations. Soils in the investigated sites proved to be deficient in major macronutrients and to contain toxic levels of Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd. Botanical survey of the prospected sites showed the abundance of diverse plant communities (46 species and 19 families), with no obvious toxicity symptoms. Results showed that the concentrations of heavy metals were different in the same plant species and from plant species to another. Eight plants of 46 species namely Hirschfeldia incana (L.) Lagr.-Foss, Citrullus vulgaris (L.) Schradi, Portulaca oleracea L., Stipa capensis Thunb., Lactuca viminea (L.) J.Presl & C.Presl, Forsskaolea tenacissima L., Lycium intricatum Boiss. and Harnmada scoparia (Pomel) Iljin were considered as the best-performing specimens due to their high ability to accumulate multiple metals in their shoots and roots without being affected by excessive metal contents. This was confirmed by the transfer factors generally higher than 1. Consequently, these tolerant and native plant species could be used as tools for an effective phytorestoration of metal-contaminated sites.

AB Due to their antimicrobial properties, copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) have been proposed to be used in agriculture for pest control. Pesticides removal is mainly done by microorganisms, whose genes usually are found in conjugative catabolic plasmids (CCP). The aim of this work was to evaluate if CuNPs at subinhibitory concentrations modify the conjugation frequency (CF) of two CCP (pJP4 and pADP1). CuNPs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy with an X-ray detector, dynamic light scattering and X-ray diffraction. Mating assays were done in LB broth supplemented with CuNPs (10, 20, 50 and 100 mu g mL(-1)) or equivalent concentrations of CuSO4. Interestingly, we observed that in LB, Cu+2 release from CuNPs is fast as evaluated by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Donor and recipient strains were able to grow in all copper concentrations assayed, but CF of mating pairs was reduced to 10% in the presence of copper at 20 or 50 mu g Cu mL(-1) compared to control. Thus, our results indicated that both copper forms, CuNPs or CuSO4, negatively affected the transfer of catabolic plasmids by conjugation. Since dissemination of degradative genes by conjugation contribute to degradation of pesticides by microorganisms, this work improves our understanding of the risks of using copper in agriculture soils, which could affect the biodegradative potential of microbial communities.

AB Heavy metals are considered major pollutants of aquatic environments due to the difficulty of metabolization and the bioaccumulative potential in tissues of aquatic organisms, especially fish muscle that is often used as food worldwide. In addition to causing cell damage, some metals such as aluminium (Al), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and lead (Pb) can act as endocrine disrupting chemicals in fish. The Paraopeba and Abaete Rivers are important tributaries of the upper Sao Francisco River basin, but the Paraopeba River receives, along its course, the discharge of many types of effluents that affect fish species, including widely consumed species such as Prochilodus argenteus. This study evaluated histological and molecular changes caused by chronic exposure to heavy metals in P. argenteus from the Paraopeba River and compared this to fish from the non-impacted Abaete River. Sampled fish from both rivers were used in histological analyses and immunohistochemical assays. The results showed increased incidence of histopathologies and changes in number and morphology of germline cells in both sexes. In addition, up-regulated expression of oestrogens-induced proteins in the liver of males were detected in polluted environment. All the alterations were related to the concentration of metals in water and fish. The high concentration of various metals observed in water and fish from Paraopeba River serves as an alert to the environmental and public health regulatory authorities.

AB In this study, Auricularia Matrix Waste (AMW) was modified by sodium hydroxide and immobilized into granular adsorbent with sodium alginate to remove lead ions from aqueous solution through a fixed-bed column. The results of Scanning Electron Microscope-Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) illuminated that immobilization greatly changed the structure, elements, polarity and functional groups of the adsorbent. Amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl groups on the adsorbent actively participated lead (II) adsorption and cation exchange also played an important role in adsorption process. The effects of bed length, flow rate and lead ions concentration determined the breakthrough characteristics and remarkably impacted lead(II) adsorption. The maximum adsorption capacity of lead(II) was 151.7 mg/g, when the influent bed, bed height and initial concentration were 15 mL/min, 25 mL/min and 150 mg/L, respectively. Thomas model was more suitable than the Bohart-Adams model to describe the performance of lead(II) adsorption onto IMAMW.

AB In the present work, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models have been developed for ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals on four different aquatic species namely Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Daphnia magna, Oncorhynchus mykiss and Pimephales promelas using genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection followed by Partial Least Squares regression technique according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. Double cross-validation methodology was employed for selecting suitable models. Only 2D descriptors were used for capturing chemical information and model building, whereas validation of the models was performed by considering various stringent internal and external validation metrics. Interestingly, models could be developed even without using any LogP terms in contrary to the usual dependence of toxicity on lipophilicity. However, the current manuscript proposes highly robust and more predictive models employing computed logP descriptors. The applicability domain study was performed in order to set a pre-defined chemical zone of applicability for the obtained QSAR models, and the test compounds falling outside the domain were not taken for further analysis while making a prioritized list. An additional comparison was made with ECOSAR, an online expert system for toxicity prediction of organic pollutants, in order to prove predictability of the obtained models. The obtained robust consensus models were utilized to predict the toxicity of a large dataset of approximately 9300 drug-like molecules in order to prioritize the existing drug-like substances in accordance to their acute predicted aquatic toxicities following a scaling technique. Finally, prioritized lists of 500 most toxic chemicals obtained by respective consensus models and those predicted from ECOSAR tool have been reported.

AB A growing number of epidemiological surveys show that PM2.5 is an important promoter for the cardiovascular dysfunction induced by atmospheric pollution. PM2.5 is a complex mixture of solid and liquid airborne particles and its components determine the health risk of PM2.5 to a great extent. However, the individual cardiotoxicities of different PM2.5 fractions are still unclear, especially in the cellular level. Here we used the neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) to evaluate the cardiac toxicity of PM2.5 exposure. The cytotoxicities of Total-PM2.5, water soluble components of PM2.5 (WS-PM2.5) and water insoluble components of PM2.5 (WIS-PM2.5), which include the cell viability, cell membrane damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, were examined with NRCMs in vitro. The results indicated that Total-PM2.5 or WIS-PM2.5 exposure significantly decreased the cell viability, induced the cell membrane damage and increased the ROS level in NRCMs at concentrations above 50 mu g/mL. However, WS-PM2.5 exposure could induce the cytotoxicity on NRCMs until the concentration of WSPM2.5 was raised to a higher concentration (75 mu g/mL). Furthermore, the DNA damage was detected in NRCMs after 48 h of exposure with Total-PM2.5, WS-PM2.5 or WIS-PM2.5 (75 mu g/mL) and the adverse effects on mitochondrial function and action potentials of NRCMs were detected only both in the Total-PM2.5 and WIS-PM2.5 treatment group. In summary, our project not only estimates the risk of PM2.5 on cardiac cells but also reveal that Total-PM2.5 and WIS-PM2.5 exposure were predominantly associated with the functional cardiotoxicities in NRCMs.

AB Earthworms have been widely studied as bioindicators of soil health for their important role in sustaining soil structure and functions. Many soil contaminants such as phenanthrene have been confirmed to exert adverse effects on earthworms growth, reproduction, behaviors and biochemical conditions. However, their effects on the properties of earthworm casts have been little studied. In the present study, the effect of different doses of phenanthrene (PHE) (0, 2, 5, 10, 20 mg/kg) on the six physicochemical properties and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra characteristics of earthworm casts was assessed in artificial soil in a laboratory. 1) Residual concentration of PHE in soils and casts increased with the increasing exposure concentrations and followed the order of casts > soil, concluding that K-ow values are the important factor affecting the distribution of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) in soil and casts; 2) Earthworms produced casts with improved total organic carbon (TOC) (15-19%), NH4(+)-N (550-800(%) ), total available phosphorus (TAP) (300-450%), cation exchange capacity (CEC) (about 15%) and available potassium (AK) (7-12.6%) compared to that in unpolluted soil, indicating that earthworms still have the ability to play the role of ecological engineers even in polluted soil; 3) The sensitivity of different properties of casts to phenanthrene varies, the order of sensitivity being (most sensitive first) NH4(+)-N ( triggered as 2 mg/kg of exposure concentrations) > AK (5 mg/ kg) > Olsen-P (10 mg/kg) > TOC = pH = CEC (no response within the range of exposure concentrations). NH4(+)-N content in casts shows a clear dose-response relationship when the exposure exceeds 2 mg/kg, indicating that the index might be a potential sensitive biomarker to provide early warning for soil pollution. 4) FTIR spectra showed that the constitution of casts from earthworms in PHE-spiked soil was not significantly alternated. However, FTIR spectra revealed that the concentrations of C-O of polysaccharide in casts increased with the elevated exposure concentrations, indicating that intensities of C-O of polysaccharide at 1032 cm(-1) of casts might be also a potential biomarker for the early-warning of soil pollution. This study advances the knowledge of earthworm ecology in polluted soil, and further extends the scope of earthworm casts as a potential biomarker in soil pollution assessment.

AB This work aimed at studying the potential of a new hydrocarbonoclastic marine bacterium, Bacillus stratosphericus FLU5, to produce an efficient surface-active agent BS-FLU5. Biosurfactant production was examined on different carbon sources; using the surface tension measurement and the oil displacement test. Strain FLU5 showed its capacity to produce biosurfactants from all tested substrates, in particular the residual frying oil, which is a cheap renewable carbon source alternative, thus minimizing the high cost of producing those surfactants. MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis confirmed the presence of lipopeptides, which are identified as members of surfactin and pumilacidin series. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the purified lipopeptides produced by strain FLU5 was 50 mg/l. At this concentration, the surface tension of the water was reduced from 72 to 28 mN/m. Furthermore, the crude lipopeptides showed an interesting stability against a broad range of pH, temperature and salinity. In addition, the application of BS-FLU5 in oil recovery from hydrocarbons-contaminated soil (used motor oil) showed that it was more effective on the hydrocarbon-remobilization than some tested synthetic surfactants. Interestingly, the biosurfactant BS-FLU5 showed a negligible cytotoxic effect against the mammalian cells HEK293. These results highlight the applicability of the lipopeptides BS-FLU5 in different fields, especially in environmental remediation processes.

AB Physical and chemical structure affect properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Recent observations revealed that heating and cooling cycles at higher temperature amplitude lead to a change in DOM physical conformation assumingly followed by a slow structural relaxation. In this study, changes at lower temperature amplitudes and their relation to DOM composition were investigated using simultaneous measurements of density and ultrasonic velocity in order to evaluate the adiabatic compressibility, which is sensitive indicator of DOM structural microelasticity. Six fulvic acids (FAs) having various origins were analyzed at concentrations of 0.12, 0.6 and 1.2 g L-1 and at different temperature amplitudes. First, we validated that the used technique is sensitive to distinguish conclusively the structural changes upon heating and cooling of DOM with heating/cooling amplitude of +/- 3 degrees C and higher. This amplitude was then applied to observe the relationship between change in adiabatic compressibility and chemical composition of FA. No correlation was observed with elemental composition and aromatic structures. Positive correlations were observed with content of alkyl moieties, carboxylic and carbonyl carbons and biological activity. Based on literature data, it was concluded that alkyl moieties undergo (re)crystalization during thermal fluctuation and their structural relaxation back is very slow (if occurs). The polar moieties form a flexible hydrogel responding to thermal fluctuation by moderate dissolution and re-aggregation. Negative correlation was observed in relation to the amount of peptide and O-alkyl systems, which can be attributed to very fast structural relaxation of proteinaceous materials, i.e. their larger content leads to lower difference between original and heat-induced compressibility. Last, the increase of the heating/cooling amplitude from +/- 3 to +/- 15 degrees C resulted in an increase of the change of the adiabatic compressibility and in the extension of the relaxation time needed for DOM structure to return to the equilibrium. We conclude that this increase is caused by the increase in inner energy, and DOM conformation can reach a cascade of energy minima, which may influence DOM reactivity and biodegradability.

AB With the development of the ultra high voltage transmission technology, the voltage level of transmission line rised. Accordingly, the strength of electric field in the vicinity of transmission line increased, thus possible health effects from electric field have caused many public attentions. In this study, in order to compare effects induced by static electric field (SEF) and power frequency electric field (PFEF) on immune function, Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were exposed to 35 kV/m SEF (0 Hz) and PFEF (50 Hz),respectively. Several indicators of white blood cell, red blood cell as well as hemoglobin in peripheral blood were tested after exposure of 7, 14 and 21 days, respectively. There was no significant difference in any indicators under SEF exposure of 35 kV/m for 7d, 14d and 21d between experimental group and control group. Under the PFEF exposure of 35 kV/m, white blood cell count significantly reduced after exposure of 7d, 14d and 21d. Meanwhile, red blood cell count significantly reduced after exposure of 7d, and returned to normal level through the compensatory response of organism after exposure of 14d and 21d. Hemoglobin concentration significantly decreased only after exposure of 21d. Based on tested results of hematological indicators, SEF exposure of 35 kV/m did not affect immune functions in mice but PFEF exposure of 35 kV/m could cause a decline of immune function. This difference of effects from SEF and PFEF on immune function was possibly caused by the difference of the degree of molecular polarization and ion migration in organism under exposure of two kinds of electric fields.

AB The surge of applications for engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) across multiple industries raises safety concerns regarding human health and environmental impacts. ENMs can be hazardous through various mechanisms, including, particle dissolution and shedding of toxic metal ions, surface reactivity and perturbation of cellular membranes, lysosomal membrane damage, activation of inflammation pathways (e.g., NLRP3 inflammasome), etc. The aim of this review is therefore to discuss practical approaches for the safer design of ENMs through modification of their physicochemical properties that can lead to acute and/or chronic toxicity. This is premised on our understanding of how different ENMs induce toxicity within various biological systems. We will summarize studies that have investigated nanomaterial toxicity both in vitro and in vivo to understand the underlying mechanisms by which nanoparticles can cause inflammation, fibrosis, and cell death. With this knowledge, researchers have identified several design strategies to counter these mechanisms of toxicity. In particular, we will discuss how metal doping, surface coating and covalent functionalization, and adjustment of surface oxidation state and aspect ratio of ENMs could reduce their potential adverse effects. While these strategies might be effective under certain experimental and exposure scenarios, more research is required to fully apply this knowledge in real life applications of nanomaterials.

AB The aim of this research is to synthesize magnetite nanoparticles, using Persicaria bistorta root extract as the reducing agent, and to test its adsorption properties in the treatment of rosewater distillation wastewater. Taking advantage of Taguchi method, effect of synthesis parameters, including molar concentration of FeCl2, concentration of plant extract, temperature, and pH on crystallite size and magnetization strength is studied. Based on the successful synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles and characterization experiments, Persicaria bistorta root extract can be considered as a proper alternative as the reducing agent. Data analysis shows that crystallite size and magnetization are positively correlated with concentration of FeCl2 and pH, while inversely related to temperature and independent of plant extract concentration. The optimum values achieved for concentration of FeCl2, temperature, and pH are 0.15 M, 70 degrees C, and 11, respectively, with the production of nanoparticles with magnetite size of 45.5 nm and magnetization value of 62.5 emu/g. In addition, the application of as-synthesized magnetite nanoparticles as an adsorbent for treatment of rosewater distillation wastewater proved its high adsorption capacity for chemical oxygen demand (COD) up to 149 mg/g. Adsorption data also shows a good fitness with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models.

AB Atmospheric fine particulate matters (PM2.5) induce adverse human health effects through inhalation, and the harmful effects of PM2.5 are determined not only by its air concentrations, but also by the particle components varied temporally. To investigate seasonal differences of the aerosol toxicity effects including cell viability and membrane damage, cell oxidative stress and responses of inflammatory cytokines, the human lung epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to PM2.5 samples collected in both summer and winter by the in vitro toxicity bioassays. Toxicological results showed that, the PM2.5 led to the cell viability decrease, cell membrane injury, oxidative stress level increase and inflammatory responses in a dose-dependent manner. Temporally, the cytotoxicity of winter PM2.5 was higher than summer of this studied industrial area of Nanjing, China. According to the different contents of heavy metals accumulated in PM2.5, the transition metals such as Cu might be an important contributor to the aerosol cell toxicity.

AB Objective: We aimed to study the association of urine fluoride with intelligence quotient (IQ) in children with a careful consideration of up to 30 potential confounding factors as well as possible heterogeneity of the relation between urine fluoride levels and IQ scores across children with different dopamine receptor-2 (DRD2) Taq 1A genotypes (CC, CT, and TT).
   Methods: A school-based cross-sectional study design was applied. A total of 323 children (2014-2015, 7-12 years old) were enrolled from four schools in both historical endemic and non-endemic areas of fluorosis in Tianjin of China using a cluster sampling method. Urine fluoride levels and age-specific IQ scores in children were measured at the enrollment. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods were used to genotype DRD2 Taq 1A polymorphism with genomic DNA isolated from whole blood collected at the enrollment. Multiple linear regression models were applied to evaluate the relationship between urine fluoride levels and IQ scores overall and within the DRD2 Taq 1A SNP = CC/CT and TT subgroups. Model robustness was tested through bootstrap, sensitivity analysis, and cross-validation techniques. A safety threshold of urine fluoride levels for IQ impairment was determined in the subgroup TT.
   Results: In overall participants, the DRD2 Taq 1A polymorphism itself was not related to IQ scores in children who had a high level of urine fluoride. In the CC/CT subgroup, urine fluoride levels and IQ scores in children were unrelated (adjusted beta (95% confidence interval (CI)) = -1.59 (-4.24, 1.05), p = 0.236). Among the participants carrying the TT genotype, there was a strong and robust negative linear relationship between log urine fluoride and IQ scores in children (adjusted beta (95% CI) = -12.31 (-18.69, -5.94), p < 0.001). Urine fluoride levels had a stronger association with IQ in children carrying the TT genotype (adjusted beta = -12.31, bootstrapped standard error (SE) = 1.28), compared to that in overall participants (adjusted beta= -2.47, bootstrapped SE = 3.75) (Z = 2.483 and bootstrapped p = 0.007). The safety threshold of urine fluoride levels in the subgroup TT was 1.73 mg/L (95% CI = (1.51, 1.97) (mg/L)).
   Conclusions: There is heterogeneity in the relation between urine fluoride and IQ across children carrying different DRD2 Taq 1A genotypes. Large-scale epidemiological studies are needed to confirm our findings.

AB Bisphenol F (BPF) is a substitute of bisphenol A in the production of epoxy resin and polycarbonate. Its extensive use in consumer products leads to a wide human exposure at high levels. Although the adverse effects of BPF on animal health are of increasing public concern, its risks on systematic glucose metabolism and blood glucose concentrations still remain largely unknown. Using zebrafish larvae as the model animal, we investigated the disturbance of BPF exposure on glucose metabolism and the underlying mechanisms. Zebrafish larvae at 96 h post fertilization were exposed to 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mu g/L of BPF for 48 h. Compared with the control group, glucose levels of larvae increased significantly in the 10 and 100 mu g/L exposure groups, which are associated with enhancement of gluconeogenesis and suppression of glycolysis induced by high doses of BPF. Additionally, both mRNA expressions and protein levels of insulin increased significantly in the 10 and 100 mu g/L exposure groups, while transcription levels of genes encoding insulin receptor substrates decreased significantly in these groups, indicating a possibly decreased insulin sensitivity due to impairment of insulin signaling transduction downstream of insulin receptor. Further, compared with BPF alone, co-exposure of larvae to BPF and rosiglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, significantly attenuates increases in both glucose levels and mRNA expressions of a key gluconeogenesis enzyme. Our data therefore indicate impairing insulin signaling transduction may be the main mechanism through which BPF disrupts glucose metabolism and induces hyperglycemia. Results of the present study inform the health risk assessment of BPF and also suggest the use of zebrafish larvae in large-scale screening of chemicals with possible glucose metabolism disturbing effect.

AB Natural zeolite heulandite/polyaniline composite (Hu/PANI) was synthesized for the first time as catalyst support for nickel oxide photocatalyst (Hu/PANI@Ni2O3). The structural, chemical, morphological, textural and optical properties were investigated using different techniques. The synthetic Ni2O3 crystals showed well developed flaky habits with diameter range 200-400 nm and length range 1-4 mu m. The estimated band gap energies of Hu/PANI composite and Hu/PANI@Ni2O3 composite are 1.8 eV and 1.46 eV, respectively, which are remarkably smaller than the recorded value for pure nickel oxide. The photocatalytic properties of Hu/PANI@Ni2O3 composite for efficient degradation of safranin-T dye were evaluated under sunlight as a function of irradiation time, initial dye concentration, catalyst mass, solution pH, and the catalyst stability. Hu/PANI@Ni2O3 composite exhibits amazing photocatalytic degradation efficiency for safranin dye, whereas 80%, 98%, and similar to 100% of 5 mg/l dye were removed after only 1 min of solar irradiation using 0.025, 0.03, and 0.035 g of Hu/PANI@Ni2O3 , respectively. The higher concentrations of the dye (10-50 mg/L) can be fully removed within minutes by increasing the solution pH or using higher doses from the Hu/PANI@Ni2O3 catalyst. The removal percentage achieved the maximum value at the alkaline conditions. Also, the Hu/PANI@Ni2O3 displayed high stability and remain 84.5% of the initial photocatalytic efficiency after 5 runs. Additionally, the composite can be used effectively in the removal of different types of dyes and mixed dyes within the same time intervals. Thus, loading of nickel oxide onto hybrid Hu/PANI composite as a catalyst support achieved amazing photocatalytic degradation capacity.

AB Zearalenone (ZEA) is particularly toxic to the female reproductive system. Nevertheless, the effect of ZEA on the immune system is still not fully understood. The following study investigates the effects and mechanism of ZEA on mouse T cell activation in vitro. Briefly, T lymphocytes were extracted from primary splenic lymphocyte in mice, activated by concanavalin A, and then were exposed to different concentrations of ZEA for a certain period of time. Flow cytometry was used to detect the expression of activating and co-stimulatory molecules, and the secretion of cytokines in T cells at various stages. The expression of initiation regulatory protein in T cell activation, nuclear factor protein and co-stimulatory molecule related PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway proteins were detected by western blot. Our data showed that ZEA exposure inhibits the activity of T cell, and inhibits the expression of different activation signals in T cell. Additionally, ZEA exposure reduces the expression of initiative regulatory protein, i.e. LAT, Lck, Zap-70 during the activation of T cells. Thus, the results showed that ZEA exposure inhibits the formation and transmission of activated signal in T cells, interferes with signal pathway of T cell activation nuclear factor NFAT and NF kappa B, and decreases the secretion of cytokines after activation. Moreover, ZEA exposure interferes with co-stimulatory molecule CD28 during T cell activation, and with the activity of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway downstream of CD28. To conclude, our results indicated that ZEA toxin interferes with the activation of mouse T lymphocytes by affecting TCR signal and co-stimulatory signal, thus playing an essential role in immune toxicity.

AB Emerging nanoscience and nanotechnology inevitably facilitate discharge of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) into the environment. Owing to their versatile physicochemical properties, ENMs invariably come across and interact with various pollutants already existing in the environment, leading to considerable uncertainty regarding the risk assessment of pollutants. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of the complicated joint toxicity are still largely unexplored. This review aims to aid in understanding the interaction of ENMs and pollutants from the perspective of ecological and environmental health risk assessment. Based on related research published from 2005 to 2018, this review focuses on summarizing the effect of ENMs on the toxicity of pollutants both in vivo and in vitro. Physicochemical interaction appears as a main factor affecting ENMs-pollutants joint toxicity, with the mechanisms and the resultants for ENM-pollutant adsorption been illustrated. Cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the joint toxicity of ENMs and pollutants are discussed, including the effect of ENMs on the bioaccumulation, biodistribution, and metabolism of pollutants, as well as the defense responses of organisms against such pollutants. Future in-depth investigation are suggested to focus on further exploring biological mechanisms (especially for the antagonized effect of ENMs against pollutants), using more advanced mammalian models, and paying more attention to the realistic exposure scenarios.

AB Crop protection agents are widely used in modern agriculture and exert direct effects on non-target micro-organisms such as yeasts. Yeasts abundantly colonize wheat grain and affect its chemical composition. They can also limit pathogen growth. This study evaluated the sensitivity of yeast communities colonizing winter wheat kernels to benzimidazole, strobilurin, triazole and morpholine fungicides, trinexapac-ethyl, a commercial mixture of o-nitrophenol + p-nitrophenol + 5-nitroguaiacol, and chitosan applied during the growing season of winter wheat and in vitro in a diffusion test. A molecular identification analysis of yeasts isolated from winter wheat kernels was performed, and nucleotide polymorphisms in the CYTb gene (G143A) conferring resistance to strobilurin fungicides in yeast cells were identified. The size of yeast communities increased during grain storage, and the total counts of endophytic yeasts were significantly (85%) reduced following intensive fungicide treatment (fenpropimorph, a commercial mixture of pyraclostrobin, epoxiconazole and thiophanate-methyl). This study demonstrated that agrochemical residues in wheat grain can drive selection of yeast communities for reduced sensitivity to xenobiotics. A mutation in the CYTb gene (G143A) was observed in all analyzed isolates of the following azoxystrobin-resistant species: Aureobasidiwn pullulans, Debaryomyces hansenii, Candida albicans and C. sake. Agrochemicals tested in vitro were divided into four classes of toxicity to yeasts: (1) tebuconazole and a commercial mixture of flusilazole and carbendazim - most toxic to yeasts; (2) fenpropimorph and a commercial mixture of pyraclostrobin and epoxyconazole; (3) propiconazole, chitosan, thiophanate-methyl and a commercial mixture of o-nitrophenol, p-nitrophenol and 5-nitroguaiacol; (4) trinexapac-ethyl and azoxystrobin - least toxic to yeasts. It was found that agrochemicals can have an adverse effect on yeast abundance and the composition of yeast communities, mostly due to differences in fungicide resistance between yeast species, including the clinically significant C. albicans.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) is a crucial factor affecting the immobilization of heavy metal in wetlands. Recent studies have shown that the rhizosphere SOM has great ability to immobilize heavy metals. However, there existed few works on studying molecular characteristics of SOM to explore the mechanisms. Electrospray ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS) combined with FTIR spectroscopy were applied to investigate the characteristics of SOM in rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere samples and to find out what characteristics the rhizosphere SOM embodies conducive to metal binding in this paper. The rhizosphere contained higher C, P, Mn, and other metal concentrations. The adsorption of Cr on rhizosphere SOM was greater than that on nonrhizosphere SOM. Compared to nonrhizosphere SOM, rhizosphere SOM contained less saturated and more oxidized compounds, greater overall molecular weights (MW), more condensed aromatic structures (56.59% VS 51.56% by peak intensity), less carboxylate and N-containing COO functional groups (25.98% VS 56.63% by peak intensity), more hydrophilicity, and the latter four are conducive to metal binding. This study showed that the rhizosphere SOM had unique compositional and structural characteristics. These results provided evidence for the phytoremediation technologies of heavy metal contaminated wetlands.

AB To identify possible cadmium (Cd) accumulators or hyperaccumulators among ornamental plants, a pot experiment involving increasing Cd concentration (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 100 mg kg(-1)) was conducted among seven species. The principal objective was to screen for ornamental plants with an exceptional ability to accumulate and translocate Cd ions as well as sufficient biomass for harvesting. Regarding shoot biomass, root biomass, plant height and tolerance index (TI), Malva rotundifolia showed high tolerance to Cd and Malva crispa, Sida rhombifolia, Celosia argentea and Celosia cristata medium tolerance; Althaea rosea and Abutilon theophrasti were more sensitive to Cd than the other plants. A hormetic response was induced by Cd in M. crispa, C. argentea, C. cristata and M. rotundifolia. Based on its capacity for Cd accumulation, bioaccumulation coefficients (BCFs) and translocation factors (TFs), M. rotundifolia was selected from candidate plants after 60 days of exposure to Cd-contaminated soil and found to have accumulated more than 200 mg kg(-1) Cd in its roots and 900 mg kg(-1) in its shoots. Moreover, M. rotundifolia BCFs and TFs were higher than 1.0, with the former ranging from 1.41 to 3.31 and the latter from 1.03 to 7.37. Taken together, these results indicate that M rotundifolia can be classified as a model hyperaccumulator.

AB In vitro experiments were performed to determine whether auxin can mediate the formation of adventitious roots in response to heavy metal and drought stresses using a model rooting plant, mung bean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek]. The treatments with CdCl2 or mannitol alone significantly inhibited the formation and growth of adventitious roots in mung bean seedlings. In contrast, when CdCl2 or mannitol was applied together with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), IBA considerably cancelled the inhibition of adventitious rooting by stresses. Treatment with CdCl2 or mannitol alone significantly increased the soluble protein and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents. CdCl2 and mannitol stress each induced differentially significant changes in the activities of antioxidative enzyme and antioxidant levels during adventitious rooting. Notably, both CdCl2 and mannitol stress strongly reduced the peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities and glutathione (GSH) and phenols levels. Catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were enhanced by CdCl2 but reduced by mannitol. CdCl2 increased the ascorbate acid (ASA) level, which was decreased by mannitol. Furthermore, when CdCl2 or mannitol was applied together with IBA, IBA counteracted the CdCl2- or mannitol-induced increase or decrease in certain antioxidants, MDA, and antioxidative enzymes. These results suggest that Cd and mannitol stress inhibition of adventitious rooting is associated with the regulation of antioxidative enzymes and antioxidants in cells to defense the oxidative stress. Moreover, IBA alleviates the effects of Cd and mannitol stress on the rooting process partially through the regulation of antioxidative defense systems.

AB This study constructed a biological-inorganic hybrid system including Pseudomonas putida (P. putida) and bioreduced Pd (0) nanoparticles (NPs), and inspected the influence of bio-nano Pd (0) on the direct electron transfer and phenol biodegradation. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) showed that bio-nano Pd (0) (similar to 10 nm) were evenly dispersed on the surface and in the periplasm of P. putida. With the incorporation of bio-nano Pd (0), the redox currents of bacteria in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) became higher and the oxidation current increased as the addition of lactate, while the highest increase rates of two electron transfer system (ETS) rates were 63.97% and 33.79%, respectively. These results indicated that bio-nano Pd (0) could directly promote the electron transfer of P. putida. In phenol biodegradation process, P. putida-Pd (0) - 2 showed the highest k (0.2992 h(-1)), mu(m) (0.035 h(-1)) and K-i (714.29 mg/L) and the lowest apparent K-s (76.39 mg/L). The results of kinetic analysis indicated that bio-nano Pd (0) markedly enhanced the biocatalytic efficiency, substrate affinity and the growth of cells compared to native P. putida. The positive effects of bio-nano Pd (0) to the electron transfer of P. putida would promote the biodegradation of phenol.

AB Concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) were investigated in indoor air quality of 50 beauty salons in Ardabil, Iran (2017). Ten liters of air samples were collected from each salons regarding the recommended method and analyzed by GC-FID for BTEX concentration. Also, structural and operational conditions of the salons were studied with a self-designed questioner. The results of this study show that the mean concentration of benzene (32.40 +/- 26.38) higher than the recommended levels by Health Canada, ANSES and HKSAR. Among the BTEX, ethylbenzene (62.38 +/- 32.37) has the most concentrations in the salons. Subsequently, the cancer risk values in different age groups of birth to < 6, 6 to < 21, and 21 to < 81 for benzene (1.83 x 10(-3), 2.76 x 10(-4) and 1.50 x 10(-4), respectively) and ethylbenzene (4.9 x 10(-4), 7.30 x 10(-5) and 3.52 x 10(-5), respectively) for long time exposure were drastically higher than the recommended levels. The results showed that the benzene concentration is significantly influenced by the structural and operational conditions of type of ventilation system, area of the salons, the number of people in the salon, number of services in the salons, and while doing of bridal makeup.

AB Endosulfan (ES) modifies the ultrastructure of skeletal muscle fibers and causes changes to the swimming behavior of fish. The objectives of the present work were to evaluate, in fishes of Australoheros facetus, 1) the integrity of myofibrils (Mf) by the analysis of SDS-PAGE profiles, and 2) the functionality of Mf through the microscopically monitoring of the contraction and changes in Mg2+ Ca2+- ATPase and Mg2+(EGTA)-ATPase activities. As expected, after the addition of the contraction buffer, control fish Mf contracted. On the contrary, Mf from fish exposed at 0.5 mu g/L ES showed a partial contraction and none of the fish exposed at 10 mu g/L ES contracted. As judged by its high Mg2+ Ca2+ ATPase activity and low Mg2+ (EGTA) ATPase activity, control Mf showed good functionality. In Mf from fish exposed to 0.5 and 10 mu g/L ES the activities of these enzymes were similar, suggesting denaturation or degradation of some component of tropomyosin troponin complex. SDS-PAGE patterns of Mf from fish exposed to ES showed degradation of the myosin heavy chain and of tropomyosin. Similar values of lipid peroxidation (TSARS) were found in both control and exposed Mf, suggesting that lipid oxidation was not be related to the above-mentioned changes. The observed effects expand the knowledge of ES action in muscles and could be used as biomarkers of damage in fishes exposed to organochlorine compounds like the insecticide endosulfan.

AB The agricultural soil contaminated with heavy metals induces toxic effects on plant growth. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of vanadium (V) on growth, H2O2 and enzyme activities, cell death, ion leakage, and at which concentration; V induces the toxic effects in chickpea plants grown in red soil. The obtained results indicated that the biomass (fresh and dry) and lengths of roots and shoots were significantly decreased by V application, and roots accumulated more V than shoots. The enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, and POD) and ion leakage were increased linearly with increasing V concentrations. However, the protein contents, and tolerance indices were significantly declined with the increasing levels of V. The results about the cell death indicated that the cell viability was badly damaged when plants were exposed to higher V, and induction of H2O2 might be involved in this cell death. In conclusion, all the applied V levels affected the enzymatic activities, and induced the cell death of chickpea plants. Furthermore, our results also confirmed that vanadium 130 mg kg(-1) induced detrimental effects on chickpea plants. Additional investigation is needed to clarify the mechanistic explanations of V toxicity at the molecular level and gene expression involved in plant cell death.

AB Widespread agricultural use of neonicotinoid insecticides has resulted in frequent detection of mixtures of these compounds in global surface waters. Recent evidence suggests that neonicotinoid mixtures can elicit synergistic toxicity in aquatic insects under acute exposure conditions, however this has not been validated for longer exposures more commonly encountered in the environment. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the chronic (28-day) toxicity of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam mixtures under different doses and mixture ratios to determine if the assumption of synergistic toxicity would hold under more environmentally realistic exposure settings. The sensitive aquatic insect Chironomus dilutus was used as a representative test species, and successful emergence was used as a chronic endpoint. Applying the MIXTOX modeling approach, predictive parametric models were fitted using single-compound toxicity data and statistically compared to observed toxicity in subsequent mixture tests. Imidacloprid-clothianidin, clothianidin-thiamethoxam and imidacloprid-clothianidin-thiamethoxam mixtures did not significantly deviate from concentration-additive toxicity. However, the cumulative toxicity of the imidacloprid-thiamethoxam mixture deviated from the concentration additive reference model, displaying dose-ratio dependent synergism and resulting in up to a 10% greater reduction in emergence from that predicted by concentration addition. Furthermore, exposure to select neonicotinoid mixtures above 1.0 toxic unit tended to shift sex-ratios toward more male-dominated populations. Results indicate that, similar to acute exposures, the general assumption of joint additivity cannot adequately describe chronic cumulative toxicity of all neonicotinoid mixtures. Indeed, our observations of weak synergism and sex-ratio shifts elicited by some mixture combinations should be considered in water quality guideline development and environmental risk assessment practices for neonicotinoid insecticides, and explored in further investigations of the effects of neonicotinoid mixtures on aquatic communities.

Here we exposed zebrafish separately to two FQs (enrofloxacin (ENR) and ofloxacin (OFL)) in different copper (Cu) concentrations for 20 days (d) in a flow-through system, followed by a 11 d depuration period in clean water to investigate compound specific bioaccumulation and tissue distribution. Two FQs could accumulate in zebrafish, and the high concentration was observed in liver. Moreover, the levels of FQs in different treatment groups were higher than the corresponding control fish group. The uptake rates (k(1)), elimination rates (k(2)), BCF value, and half-lives (t(1/2)) of FQs ranged from 0.02 to 3.28 d(-1), 0.01 to 0.97 d(-1), 0.33 to 109.33, 9.90 to 69.31 d, respectively. With Cu exposure concentration's increasing, k(1), values in three tissues (liver, skin and gill) obviously decreased. The exposure concentration affected the BCF value significantly, but didn't change their relative compositions in liver, gill, skin, and muscle after long time exposure. BCF values of ENR were always a little bit higher than those of OFL in almost all the tissues (liver, skin and gill) in the low Cu concentration treatments, whereas, in the high Cu concentration treatments the bioconcentration factors (BCF) values of ENR were lower than the values of OFL. The exposure of Cu played an important role in the FQs bioconcentration and BCF. These results are meaningful for improved understanding and prediction of the behavior and fate of metallic and antibiotics in aqueous environments.

AB Natural species are widely used as indicator organisms to estimate of the impact of environmental pollution. Here we present the results of first study of a reliability of parthenogenetic Darevskia armeniaca and bisexual Darevskia raddei rock lizards as sentinels for monitoring of environmental genotoxicity. The comet assay and micronucleus test were applied to the lizards sampled in six areas in Armenia and Artsakh with different levels of soil contamination. The results obtained showed a clear relationship between the pollution level of lizards' habitats and the frequency of DNA damage in the comet assay. Low baseline frequency of micronuclei in D. armeniaca and D. raddei, however, makes this parameter ineffective for environmental genotoxicity evaluation. The parthenogenetic lizards D. armeniaca showed higher sensitivity toward genotoxic pollutions compared with bisexual D. raddei living in the same environment. The correlations between soil content of heavy metals Cr, Cu, Zn, Mo, Pb and DNA damage in D. armeniaca and between Cu, As, Mo, Pb and DNA damage in D. raddei were revealed. Overall, the lizards D. raddei and D. armeniaca appeared to be sensitive species in detecting soil pollution in natural environment. The application of the comet assay in Darevskia lizard species can be considered as a more appropriate method than a micronucleus test. The use of parthenogenetic lizards D. armeniaca as bioindicator will permit to assess the environmental genotoxicity independent of the genetic polymorphism of bisexual species.

AB Nano-sized TiO2 (nTiO(2)) exerts an oxidative effect on cells upon exposure to solar or UV irradiation and eco-toxicity of the nTiO(2) is an urgent concern. Little information is available regarding the effect of TiO2 on cells under dark conditions. Metabolomics is a unique approach to the discovery of biomarkers of nTiO(2) cytotoxicity, and leads to the identification of perturbed metabolic pathways and the mechanism underlying nTiO(2) toxicity. In the present study, gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS)-based metabolomics was performed to investigate the effect of nTiO(2) on sensitive cells (P. polycephalum macroplasmodium) under dark conditions. According to the multivariate pattern recognition analysis, at least 60 potential metabolic biomarkers related to sugar metabolism, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, polyamine biosynthesis, and secondary metabolites pathways were significantly perturbed by nTiO(2). Notably, many metabolic biomarkers and pathways were related to anti-oxidant mechanisms in the living organism, suggesting that nTiO(2) may induce oxidative stress, even under dark conditions. This speculation was further validated by the biochemical levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and total soluble phenols (TSP). We inferred that the oxidative stress might be related to nTiO(2)-induced imbalance of cellular ROS. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate the nTiO(2)-induced metabolic perturbations in slime mold, provide a new perspective of the mechanism underlying nTiO(2) toxicity under dark conditions, and show that metabolomics can be employed as a rapid, reliable and powerful tool to investigate the interaction among organisms, the environment, and nanomaterials.

AB This research focuses on removing Direct Blue 71 (DB 71) from aqueous solution in an efficient and very fast route by ionic liquid mediated gamma-Fe203 magnetic ionomer. 2-hydroxyethylammonium sulphonate immobilized on gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (gamma-Fe2O3-2-HEAS) was used for this purpose. The influence of shaking time, medium pH, the concentration of sorbent and NaNO3 on removal was evaluated to greatly influence removal extent. The optimal removal conditions were determined by response surface methodology based on the four-variable central composite design to obtain maximum removal efficiency and determine the significance and interaction effect of the variables on the removal of target triazo dye. The results have shown that an amount of 98.2% as % removal under the optimum conditions. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms were well fitted to a pseudo second order model and Freundlich model, respectively. Based on these models, the maximum dye adsorption capacity (Q(m)) of 47.60 mg g(-1) was obtained. Finally, the proposed nano-adsorbent was applied satisfactorily for removal of target triazo dye from different water samples.

AB To trace the most concerned bioavailable mercury (Hg) in aquatic environment, fish samples were collected from three typical regions in China, including 3 rivers and 1 lake in the Tibetan Plateau (TP, a high altitude background region with strong solar radiation), the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR, the largest artificial freshwater reservoir in China), and the Chinese Bohai Sea (CBS, a heavily human-impacted semi-enclosed sea). The Hg isotopic compositions in fish muscles were analyzed. The results showed that anthropogenic emissions were the main sources of Hg in fish from TGR and CBS because of the observed negative delta Hg-202 and positive Delta Hg-199 in these two regions (TGR, delta Hg-202: - 0.72 to - 0.29%, Delta Hg-199: 0.15 - 0.52 parts per thousand; CBS, delta Hg-202: - 2.09 to - 0.86 parts per thousand, Delta Hg-199: 0.07 - 0.52 parts per thousand). The relatively higher delta Hg-202 and Delta Hg-199 (delta Hg-202: - 0.37 - 0.08 parts per thousand, Delta Hg-199: 0.50 - 1.89 parts per thousand) in fish from TP suggested the insignificant disturbance from local anthropogenic activities. The larger slopes of Delta Hg-199/Delta(201) g in fish from TGR (1.29 +/- 0.14, 1SD) and TP (1.25 +/- 0.06, 1SD) indicated methylmercury (MeHg) was produced and photo-reduced in the water column before incorporation into the fish. In contrast, the photoreduction of Hg2+ was the main process in CBS (slope of Delta Hg-199/Delta Hg-201: 1.06 +/- 0.06, 1SD). According to the fingerprint data of Hg isotopes, the most important source for aquatic bioavailable Hg in TP should be the long-range transported Hg, contrasting to the anthropogenic originated MeHg from surface sediments and runoffs in TGR and inorganic Hg from continental inputs in CBS. Therefore, the isotopic signatures of Hg in fish can provide novel clues in tracing sources and behaviors of bioavailable Hg in aquatic systems, which are critical for further understanding the biogeochemical cycling of Hg.

AB A total of 21 surface sediments from the Yellow River Estuary (YRE) and a sediment core from the abandoned Old Yellow River Estuary (GYRE) were analyzed for n-alkanes using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). n-Alkanes in the range C-12-C-33 and C-13-C-34 were identified in the surface sediments and the core, respectively. The homologous series were mainly bimodal distribution pattern without odd/even predominance in the YRE and GYRE. The total n-alkanes concentrations in the surface sediments ranged from 0.356 to 0.572 mg/kg, with a mean of 0.434 mg/kg on dry wt. basis. Evaluation of n-alkanes proxies indicated that the aliphatic hydrocarbons in the surface sediments were derived mainly from a petrogenic source with a relatively low contribution of submerged/floating macrophytes, terrestrial and emergent plants. The dated core covered the time period 1925-2012 and the mean sedimentation rate was ca. 0.5 cm/yr. The total n-alkanes concentrations in the core ranged from 0.0394 to 0.941 mg/kg, with a mean of 0.180 mg/kg. The temporal evolution of n-alkanes reflected the historical input of aliphatic hydrocarbons and was consistent with local and regional anthropogenic activity. In general, the investigation on the sediment core revealed a trend of regional environmental change and the role of anthropogenic activity in environmental change.

AB Methylglyoxal (MG) now is found to be an emerging signaling molecule. It can relieve the toxicity of cadmium (Cd), however its alleviating mechanism still remains unknown. In this study, compared with the Cd-stressed seedlings without MG treatment, MG treatment could stimulate the activities of glutathione reductase (GR) and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-ECS) in Cd-stressed wheat seedlings, which in turn induced an increase of reduced glutathione (GSH). Adversely, the activated enzymes related to GSH biosynthesis and increased GSH were weakened by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, MG scavenger), 2,4-dihydroxy-benzylamine (DHBA) and 1,3-bischloroethyl-nitrosourea (BCNU, both are specific inhibitors of GR), buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, a specific inhibitors of GSH biosynthesis), and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, GSH scavenger), respectively. In addition, MG increased the activities of glyoxalase I (Gly I) and glyoxalase II (Gly II) in Cd-treated seedlings, followed by declining an increase in endogenous MG as comparision to Cd-stressed seedlings alone. On the contrary, the increased glyoxalase activity and decreased endogenous MG level were reversed by NAC and specific inhibitors of Gly I (isoascorbate, IAS; squaric acid, SA). Furthermore, MG alleviated an increase in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in Cd-treated wheat seedlings. These results indicated that MG could alleviate Cd toxicity and improve the growth of Cd-stressed wheat seedlings by a coordinated induction of glutathione pool and glyoxalase system.

AB Direct and alternating current electric fields with various voltages were used to improve the decontamination efficiency of chelator assisted phytoremediation for multi-metal polluted soil. The alleviation effect of electric field on leaching risk caused by chelator application during phytoremediation process was also evaluated. Biomass yield, pollutant uptake and metal leaching retardation under alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) electric fields were compared. The biomass yield of Eucalyptus globulus under AC fields with various voltages (2, 4 and 10 V) were 3.91, 4.16 and 3.67 kg, respectively, significantly higher than the chelator treatment without electric field (2.71 kg). Besides growth stimulation, AC fields increased the metal concentrations of plant tissues especially in aerial parts manifested by the raised translocation factor of different metals. Direct current electric fields with low and moderate voltages increased the biomass production of the species to 3.45 and 3.12 kg, respectively, while high voltage on the contrary suppressed the growth of the plants (2.66 kg). Under DC fields, metal concentrations elevated obviously with increasing voltages and the metal translocation factors were similar under all voltages. Metal extraction per plant achieved the maximum value under moderate voltage due to the greatest biomass production. DC field with high voltage (10 V) decreased the volume of leachate from the chelator treatment without electric field from 1224 to 56 mL, while the leachate gathered from AC field treatments raised from 512 to 670 mL. DC field can retard the downward movement of metals caused by chelator application more effectively relative to AC field due to the constant water flow and electroosmosis direction. Alternating current field had more promotive effect on chelator assisted phytoremediation efficiency than DC field illustrated by more metal accumulation in the species. However, with the consideration of leaching risk, DC field with moderate voltage was the optimal supplementary technique for phytoremediation.

AB Cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) pollutions caused by industrial activities are one of the most serious threats to aquatic ecosystems. The aim of this study is to investigate the Cd and Pb bioaccumulations and diverse physiological and biochemical properties of Ceratophyllum demersum L. exposed to different concentrations of Cd (0.5-2.0 mg/L) and Pb (25-100 mg/L) in aqueous media for 1, 3 and 5 days. Cd and Pb accumulations increased with increase in the exposure times and concentrations, and the highest accumulation values of Cd and Pb were recorded at 2 mg/L (2668.33 mg/kg dw) and 100 mg/L (22,504.10 mg/kg dw), respectively, after 5 days. However, higher bioconcentration factors (BCF) were calculated as 645.43 at 25 mg/L Pb and as 1357.92 at 1 mg/L Cd after 5 days. The results showed that photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids) and protein contents of the plants exposed to Cd and Pb toxicities decreased with increasing metal concentration and exposure time, whereas their malondialdehyde (MDA) contents increased. Additionally, the single and synergistic effects of duration and metal concentration on the fresh and dry weights of the plant were determined. The results of this study reveal that C. demersum, propagated by tissue culture technique, can be used effectively in the phytoremediation of aquatic environments contaminated by Cd and Pb. This study will also make a positive contribution to the progression of new phytotechnologies on the purpose of the remediation of wastewater by plants in future.

AB The evolution of microbial communities during the electrokinetic treatment of antibiotic-polluted soil (EKA) was investigated with chlortetracycline (CTC), oxytetracycline (OTC) and tetracycline (TC) as template antibiotics. The total population of soil microorganisms was less affected during the electrokinetic process, while living anti-CTC, anti-OTC, anti-TC and anti-MIX bacteria were inactivated by 10.48%, 31.37%, 34.76%, and 22.08%, respectively, during the 7-day treatment compared with antibiotic-polluted soil without an electric field (NOE). Accordingly, samples with NOE treatment showed a higher Shannon index than those with EKA treatment, indicating a reduction of the microbial community diversity after electrokinetic processes. The major taxonomic phyla found in the samples of EKA and NOE treatment were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. And the distribution of Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Chloroflexi was greatly decreased compared with blank soil. In the phylum Proteobacteria, the abundance of Alphaproteobacteria was greatly reduced in the soils supplemented with antibiotics (from 13.40% in blank soil to 6.43-10.16% after treatment); while Betaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria showed a different trend with their abundance increased compared to blank soil, and Gammaproteobacteria remained unchanged for all treatments (2.36-2.78%). The varied trends for different classes indicated that the major bacterial groups changed with the treatments due to their different adaptability to the antibiotics as well as to the electric field. SulI being an exception, the reduction ratio of the observed antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) including tetC, tetG, tetW, tetM, intlI, and sulII in the 0-2 cm soil sampled with EKA versus NOE treatment reached 55.17%, 3.59%, 99.26%, 89.51%, 30.40%, and 27.92%, respectively. Finally, correlation analysis was conducted between antibiotic-resistant bacteria, ARGs and taxonomic bacterial classes. It was found that sulII was the most representative of many different bacteria among the seven ARGs studied. This is the first report on the changes in microbial communities before and after EKA, and the present results demonstrated that the application of EKA is a useful and effective approach to suppressing both antibiotic resistant microorganisms and ARGs.

AB The present study explored the influence of Zn addition in the water on Zn transport and lipid metabolism of two intestinal regions in goby Synechogobius hasta. Zn contents in water were 0.004 (control), 0.181 and 0.361 mg Zn L-1, respectively. The experiment lasted for 28 days. TG and Zn contents, mRNA contents of genes of Zn transport and lipid metabolism, and enzyme activity from anterior and mid-intestine tissues were analyzed. In anterior intestine, Zn addition in the water increased Zn contents, and mRNA concentrations of ZIP4, ZIPS, ATGL, PPAR alpha, ZNF202 and KLF7, decreased TG contents, 6PGD and G6PD activities, and mRNA contents of 6PGD, G6PD, FAS, PPAR gamma, ICDH and KLF4. In mid-intestine tissue, the highest Zn and TG contents were observed for 0.18 mg Zn/l group, in parallel with the highest expressions of ZnT1, ZIP4, ZIPS, 6PGD, FAS, ICDH, PPAR gamma, PPAR alpha, ZNF202, KLF4 and KLF7, and with the highest FAS, 6PGD and G6PD activities. Thus, in the anterior intestine, Zn addition increased lipolysis and decreased lipogenesis, and accordingly reduced TG content. However, the highest mid-intestinal TG content in 0.18 mg Zn/l group was due to the up-regulated lipogenesis. Although lipolysis was also increased, the incremental lipid synthesis was enough to compensate for lipid degradation, which led TG accumulation. Our results, for the first time, show an anterior/mid functional regionalization of the intestine in lipid metabolism and Zn transport of S. hasta following Zn exposure.

AB Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects 1 in 300 children by age 18. T1D is caused by inflammation-induced loss of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, leading to high blood glucose and a host of downstream complications. Although multiple genes are associated with T1D risk, only 5% of genetically susceptible individuals actually develop clinical disease. Moreover, a growing number of T1D cases occur in geographic clusters and among children with low risk genotypes. These observations suggest that environmental factors contribute to T1D etiology. One potential factor, supported primarily by epidemiological studies, is the presence of nitrate and nitrite in drinking water. To test this hypothesis, female hatchling alligators were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of nitrate in their tank water (reference, 10 mg/L, or 100 mg/L NO3-N) from hatch through 5 weeks or 5 months of age. At each time point, endpoints related to T1D were investigated: plasma levels of glucose, triglycerides, testosterone, estradiol, and thyroxine; pancreas, fat body, and thyroid weights; weight gain or loss; presence of immune cells in the pancreas; and pancreatic beta cell number, assessed by antibody staining of nkx6.1 protein. Internal dosing of nitrate was confirmed by measuring plasma and urine nitrate levels and whole blood methemoglobin. Cluster analysis indicated that high nitrate exposure (most animals exposed to 100 mg/L NO3-N and one alligator exposed to 10 mg/L NO3-N) induced a profile of endpoints consistent with early T1D that could be detected after 5 weeks and was more strongly present after 5 months. Our study supports epidemiological data correlating elevated nitrate with T1D onset in humans, and highlights nitrate as a possible environmental contributor to the etiology of T1D, possibly through its role as a nitric oxide precursor.

AB Biological treatments are considered an environmentally option to clean-up polluted soil with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). A pot experiment was conducted to comparatively evaluate four different strategies, including natural attenuation (NA), mycoaugmentation (M) by using Crucibulum leave, phytoremediation (P) using maize plants, and microbial-assisted phytoremediation (MAP) for the bioremediation of an aged PAH-polluted soil at 180 days. The P treatment had higher affinity degrading 2-3 and 4 ring compounds than NA and M treatments, respectively. However, M and P treatments were more efficient in regards to naphthalene, indeno [1,2,3-c,d]pyrene and benzo[g,h,i]perylene degradation respect to NA. However, 4, 5-6 rings undergo a strong decline during the microbe-assisted phytoremediation, being the treatment which determined the highest rates of PAHs degradation. Sixteen PAH compounds, except fluorene and dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, were found in maize roots, whereas the naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, and pyrene were accumulated in the shoots, in both P and MAP treatments. However, higher PAH content in maize biomass was achieved during the MAP treatment respect to P treatment. The bioconversion and translocation factors were less than 1, indicating that phystabilization/phytodegradation processes occurred rather than phytoextraction. The microbial biomass, activity and ergosterol content were significantly boosted in the MAP treatment respect to the other treatments at 180 days. Ours results demonstrated that maize-C. laeve association was the most profitable technique for the treatment of an aged PAH-polluted soil when compared to other bioremediation approaches.

AB Palygorskite is a mineral widely applied for the removal of potentially toxic trace elements from the environment. This study aimed to identify the influence of pH (3, 4, 5, and 6) and humic acid (200 mg L-1) addition on the adsorption of hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)) ions by the microparticles and nanoparticles of palygorskite. Therefore, the mineral was prepared as the micron- and nano-sized particles saturated with Ba2+ ions, and finally used in adsorption experiments. The results indicated that regardless of the mineral size, Cr(VI) adsorption was enhanced by increasing the contact time from 5 to 2880 min and the equilibrium conditions achieved after 1440 min from the beginning of experiments. With increasing the pH values from 3 to 6, the adsorption efficiency of Cr (VI) decreased significantly, and the highest rate of removal (64%) was found at pH = 3. The pseudo-second-order model best described the kinetics of Cr(VI) adsorption onto both micro- and nanoparticles of palygorskite. Also, the experimental data showed maximum consistency with the data calculated by the Freundlich isotherm model. The two processes of film and pore diffusion were recognized as the main mechanisms that controlled the adsorption of Cr(VI) by palygorskite microparticles and nanoparticles. A comparison of the maximum adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) in different treatments followed the order of nanoparticles > humic acid > humic acid + nanoparticles approximate to humic acid + microparticles > microparticles. Accordingly, the adsorption capacities of "palygorskite nanoparticles" and "humic acid" for Cr(VI) ions were 3.7 and 3.2 times higher than that of palygorskite microparticles, respectively. Moreover, the adsorption capacities observed in the simultaneous application of humic acid with palygorskite microparticles and nanoparticles were 20% and 45% lower than those without humic acid, respectively. To conclude, palygorskite nanoparticles were found to have a significant adsorption capacity for Cr(VI) ions, which is negatively affected by rise in the pH of the aqueous matrix.

AB Objective: Find the correlation between particulate matter (PM) and biomarkers related to blood coagulation, offer medical evidence to sensitive indicators and carry out early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases.
   Method: A combination of computer and manual retrieval was used to search for the keywords in PubMed (584 records), Cochrane Library (28 records), Web of Science (162 records) and Embase (163 records). Finally, a total of 25 articles were included in this meta-analysis. Stata 13.0 was applied to examine the heterogeneity among the studies and to calculate the combined effect estimates, percent variation (%) and 95% CI by selecting corresponding models. Additionally, sensitivity analysis and publication bias test were also conducted.
   Results: Meta-analysis indicated that there was an association between PM2.5 exposure (per 10 mu g/m(3) increase) and fibrinogen. With the increase of PM2.5 exposure (per 10 mu g/m(3) increase), the content of fibrinogen revealed a high level (2.26%; 95% CI: 1.08-3.44%); and the increase of UFPs exposure (per 5000/cm(3) increase) was correlated with some biomarkers such as cell surface antigen and protein ligand including ICAM-1, sCD4OL, Pselectin, E-selectin and PAI-1 that indirectly related to blood coagulation, yielding a percent variation of 10.83% (95% CI: 3.49%-18.17%).
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis expounded that PM-related biomarkers were associated with blood coagulation, and the relationship with fibrinogen was much stronger.

AB Compared to the general population, firefighters are known to sustain greater levels of exposure to hazardous compounds, despite their personal protective equipment, also known as turnout gear. Among the most significant toxins that firefighters are chronically exposed to are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Additionally, firefighters have also been noted to exhibit an increased incidence of certain types of cancer. Considering a probable link between exposure to PAHs and increased rates of cancer in the fire service, we aim to document ambient chemical concentrations in the firefighter work environment. Our strategy involves the use of silicone-based wristbands that have the capacity to passively sorb PAHs. To determine if wristbands can serve as an effective chemical monitoring device for the fire service, silicone wristbands were pilot-tested as personal sampling devices for work environment risk monitoring in active-duty firefighters. Recovered wristbands underwent multiple extraction steps, followed by GC-MS analysis to demonstrate their efficacy in monitoring PAHs in the firefighter environment. Initial findings from all wristband samples taken from firefighters showed multiple exposures to various PAHs of concern for the health of the firefighters when in a fire environment. In addition to PAH monitoring, we examined known and potential sources of PAH contamination in their work environment. To that end, profiles of elevated PAH concentrations were documented at various fire stations throughout South Florida, for individual firefighters both during station duties and active fire response.

AB Exposure to ambient air particulate matter (PM) is associated with increased cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. In this context, alveolar macrophages exhibit proinflammatory and oxidative responses as a result of the clearance of particles, thus contributing to lung injury. However, the mechanisms linking these pathways are not completely clarified. Therefore, the oxinflammation phenomenon was studied in RAW 264.7 macrophages exposed to Residual Oil Fly Ash (ROFA), a PM surrogate rich in transition metals. While cell viability was not compromised under the experimental conditions, a proinflammatory phenotype was observed in cells incubated with ROFA 100 mu g/mL, characterized by increased levels of TNF-alpha and NO production, together with PM uptake. This inflammatory response seems to precede alterations in redox metabolism, characterized by augmented levels of H2O2, diminished GSH/GSSG ratio, and increased SOD activity. This scenario resulted in increased oxidative damage to phospholipids. Moreover, alterations in mitochondrial respiration were observed following ROFA incubation, such as diminished coupling efficiency and spare respiratory capacity, together with augmented proton leak. These findings were accompanied by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Finally, NADPH oxidase (NOX) and mitochondria were identified as the main sources of superoxide anion (O-2(center dot-)) in our model. These results indicate that PM exposure induces direct activation of macrophages, leading to inflammation and increased reactive oxygen species production through NOX and mitochondria, which impairs antioxidant defense and may cause mitochondrial dysfunction.

AB Previous studies suggested the suitability of the brackish-water serpulid (Ficopomatus enigmaticus) to be used as model organism for both marine and brackish waters monitoring, by the performance of sperm toxicity and larval development assays. The present study focused on larval development after the exposure of two F. enigmaticus populations (Mediterranean and Atlantic, collected in Italy and Portugal, respectively) to different trace elements (copper, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and lead) at different concentrations. Results of larval development assays were presented as the percentage of abnormal developed larvae. The effect, measured in terms of EC50 for all toxicants tested, showed that mercury was the most toxic metal for larvae of both populations. Specifically, the tested trace elements may be racked in the following order from the highest to the lowest toxicity: Mediterranean: mercury > copper > lead > arsenic > cadmium; Atlantic: mercury > copper > cadmium > arsenic > lead. Responses of both populations were similar for arsenic. Lead was the least toxic element for the Atlantic population, while cadmium showed the least toxicity for the Mediterranean population. These preliminary results demonstrate the sensitivity and suitability of the organisms to be used in ecotoxicological bioassays and monitoring protocols. Moreover, chemical analyses on soft tissues and calcareous tubes of collected test organisms and their sampling site water were performed, to identify and quantify the concentration of the tested trace elements in these 3 matrices. Populations exhibited less sensitivity to a certain element together with a relevantly higher concentration of the same element in soft tissues. This may indicate a certain resistance to particular contaminant toxic effects by organisms that tend to accumulate the same toxicant. This highlights the potential correlation between wild-caught test organisms' responses and a deep characterization of the sampling site to identify putative abnormalities or differences in model organism response during bioassay execution.

AB The impacts of microplastics (MPs) and phthalates (PAEs), a class of MP-associated contaminants, on the marine environment are not thoroughly understood despite concern over their adverse effects on humans and ecosystems. Field studies linking MPs and PAEs in seawater have not yet been reported. We investigate for the first time the correlation between MPs contamination and the presence of PAEs in the surface seawater of Jiaozhou Bay (JZB), a semi-enclosed metropolitan bay in northern China heavily impacted by human activity. The abundance of MPs, dominated by polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate mostly smaller than 2 mm, ranged between 24.44 items/m(3) and 180.23 items/m(3), with the majority being black and transparent fibers and fragments. Concentrations of PAEs varied from 129.96 ng/L to 921.22 ng/L. Relatively higher abundances of MPs and higher concentrations of PAEs were generally found in areas near riverine inputs and sewage treatment plants. There was a strong correlation between PAEs concentration and MPs abundance, suggesting that they are closely linked. In a risk assessment combining PAEs and MPs, the risk quotients (RQs) indicated that the ecological risk of di-n-butyl phthalate in JZB was relatively high (0.046<RQ < 0.516); the risk of the other PAEs were low. The overall ecological hazard index (HI) of PAEs was low to medium (0.098<HI <0.897) The risk of MPs pollution in JZB, as indicated by Pollution Load Index (PLI), was moderate (PLIJZB = 11.76), and mainly due to polyvinyl chloride.

AB In the present study, silver (Ag) atoms were chemically deposited on gamma-alumina (Al2O3) nanospheres to be further functionalized with trithiocyanuric acid (TTC). The result was Al2O3@Ag@TTC composites, which were used for the selective extraction and preconcentration of Fe (III) and Pb (II) ions in seawater and river water samples. TTC is a potent scavenger of heavy metal ions with multiple nitrogenand sulfur-containing functional groups. The concentrations of analytes were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry, and the structure of the synthetic adsorbent was characterized by spectral and microscopic techniques. Furthermore, the fundamental parameters influencing the extraction and desorption of the target ions were evaluated. Under optimized conditions, the calibration curve was linear in the range of 10-100 ng mL(-1) for both analytes. The detection limits of the proposed method for Fe (III) and Pb (II) ions were 1.5 ng mL-1 and 0.8 ng mL(-1), respectively, with a relative standard deviation of less than 6.1% (n = 7). Moreover, the proposed method tolerated salinities of up to 50.0 g L-1 without exhibiting any decrease in selectivity or recovery. The developed method was successfully applied to extract Fe (III) and Pb (II) ions from seawater and river water samples. The extraction recovery rates of the spiked ions were at least 93% for Fe (III) and 97 % for Pb (II).

AB Tributyltin (TBT), a widely and persistently distributed organontin, has been well documented to disrupt reproduction and behaviors in animals due to its anti-aromatase activity. TBT has been also reported to enhance anxiety in several fish species, whereas the mechanism underlying remains largely unknown. To investigate the disruption of TBT on fish anxiety and the mechanisms possibly involved, adult male zebrafish (Danio rerio) were treated with TBT (100 and 500 ng/L) for 28 days and anxiety behavior was further investigated using a novel tank dive test. Result showed that TBT treatment significantly enhanced the total time of the fish spent in the lower half, delayed the onset time to the higher half of the tank and increased the total duration of freezing of the fish, indicating an enhanced anxiety in TBT-treated fish. Accordingly, TBT sharply elevated the cortisol levels in plasma in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the elevated cortisol level might be involved in the enhanced anxiety. Although the expression of crha was significantly increased and crhbp was significantly decreased in the brain of TBT-treated fish which is consistent to the elevated cortisol level, the expressions of actha and acthb were sharply down-regulated. In contrast, the expressions of genes responsible for the synthesis and action of serotonin (5-HT) (pet1, thp2 and htr1aa), dopamine (DA) (th1, slc6a3, drd2a and drd2b) and gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) (gad2 and gabrg2) were all significantly inhibited. The down-regulation of these pivotal genes acting in 5-HT, DA and GABA neurotransmitter systems in response to TBT corresponded well with the TBT-enhanced anxiety in fish. It was thus strongly suggested that these neurotransmitters might be also involved in TBT-enhanced anxiety in adult male zebrafish. The present study extended our understanding of the neurotoxicity of TBT on the anxiety control and behavioral modulation in fish.

AB Soil acidification is one of the crucial global environmental problems, affecting sustainable land use, crop yield, and ecosystem stability. Previous research reported the tolerance of crops to acid soil stress. However, the molecular response of woody plant to acid conditions remains largely unclear. Rhododendron L. is a widely distributed woody plant genus and prefers to grow in acidic soils. Herein, weighted gene coexpression network analysis was performed on R. protistum var. giganteum seedlings subjected to five pH treatments (3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.0, 7.0), and their ecophysiological characteristics were determined for the identification of their molecular responses to acidic environments. Through pairwise comparison, 855 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with photosynthesis, cell wall, and phenylpropanoid metabolism were identified. Most of the DEGs related to photosynthesis and cell wall were up-regulated after pH 4.5 treatment. Results implied that the species improves its photosynthetic abilities and changes its cell wall characteristics to adapt to acidic conditions. Weighted gene co-expression network analyses showed that most of the hub genes were annotated to the biosynthetic pathways of ribosomal proteins and photosynthesis. Expression pattern analysis showed that genes encoding subunit ribosomal proteins decreased at pH 7.0 treatment, suggesting that pH 7.0 treatment led to cell injury in the seedlings. The species regulates protein synthesis in response to high pH stress (pH 7.0). The present study revealed the molecular response mechanism of woody plant R. protistum var. giganteum to acid environments. These findings can be useful in enriching current knowledge of how woody species adapt to soil acidification under global environmental changes.

AB Occupational exposure to pesticides has been identified as a factor that predisposes to disorders of the immune system. Immunosuppression, autoimmunity, cancer of various organs and other diseases in people who apply these products have been reported by the studies. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between occupational exposure to pesticides and the immunological profile in 43 farmers exposed to mixtures of pesticides for at least 15 years. A control group composed of 30 individuals without a history of occupational exposure to pesticides was also evaluated. Peripheral blood samples were processed by flow cytometry and cells were labelled with an 8-color monoclonal antibody panel. Plasma cytokines were also measured. Significant increase in classical monocytes (p < 0.001) and dendritic cells (p < 0.001) in the exposed group was observed as well in total T cells (p = 0.04), central memory CD8 T cells (p = 0.02) and effector memory CD8 T cells (p = 0.01). On the other hand, the activation markers of T cells as the expression of CD57, HLA-DR, CD25 and CD28 were evaluated and no difference was found between groups. When the B cells were analyzed, a significant decrease in total B cells (p = 0.01), regulatory B cells (p < 0.001) and plasmablasts (p < 0.001) in the exposed group, compared to healthy controls, was observed. Pro-inflammatory IL-6 was significantly elevated (p = 0.04) in the plasma of farmers compared to that of controls. The constant antigenic stimulus that occurs during exposure to pesticides can favor the recruitment of dendritic cells and macrophages (APCs) presents in the skin and respiratory tract. In the secondary lymphoid organs, the CD4 T and B cells that process such antigens are possibly undergoing proliferative exhaustion, with the consequent depletion of all mature B subpopulations. The resulting drop in humoral immunity may be offset by an increase in the number of circulating CD8 T lymphocytes due to their cytotoxic action.

AB Current study aims to determine difference in metal accumulation pattern in muscle of Liza parsia (pelagic, omnivore), Amblypharyngodon mola (surface feeder, herbivore) and Mystus gulio (benthic, carnivore) depending on their niche and feeding habit and how it affects the endogenous antioxidants and glucose metabolism in fish muscle. Fishes were collected from Malancha, Diamond Harbour and Chandanpiri, West Bengal, India. Concentrations of lead, zinc, cadmium, chromium were measured in water, sediment and fish muscle. Metal pollution index (MPI) and bioconcentration factor (BCF) was calculated to evaluate the ability of fish to accumulate specific metals in muscle tissue from the aquatic environment. Metal concentrations were found significantly higher (P < 0.05) in water, sediment, fish muscles from Malancha than Chandanpiri and Diamond Harbour. L. parsia (MPI: 0.4-1.6) showed highest metal deposition in their muscle followed by A. mola (MPI: 0.37-1.38) and M. gulio (MPI: 0.2-1.2). Malondealdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S transferase, glutathione reductase and cortisol levels increased in case of L. parsia from Malancha and Chandanpiri. Succinate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, Ca+2 ATPase and cytochrome C oxidase levels were significantly (P < 0.05) lower at Malancha and Chandanpiri than Diamond Harbour. Heat shock protein (HSP70) expression was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in all fish species at Malancha followed by Chandanpiri and Diamond Harbour. Glucose, glycogen, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and glycogen phosphorylase levels varied between sites and selected fish species. Serum cortisol level was measured and found to be the highest in L. parsia from Malancha (2.94 +/- 0.12 ng/ml) and the lowest in M. gulio from Diamond Harbour (0.7 +/- 0.05 ng/ ml). The results indicate that metal toxicity alters antioxidant levels, oxidative status and energy production in fish in species specific manner. Our results also indicate that Mystus has the highest degree of adaptability in response to metal toxicity possibly due to its specific food habit and niche position. Therefore, it can be concluded that maintenance of oxidative and metabolic status to combat metal-induced oxidative load will be helpful for the fishes to acquire better resistance under such eco-physiological stress. Alteration of niche and interactive segregation in aquatic organism may be one of the key modulator of resistance against such stress.

TI Adsorption-desorption behavior of benzobicyclon hydrolysate in different

AB Benzobicyclon is a systemic herbicide that was officially registered in China in 2018. The environmental behaviors of benzobicyclon hydrolysate (BH), the main metabolite and active product of benzobicyclon, remain poorly understood in paddy fields. Here, agricultural soil samples were collected from paddy fields in Jiangxi (Ferralsols), Shandong (Alisols), Hebei (Luvisols), Heilongjiang (Phaeozems), Zhejiang (Anthrosols), Sichuan (Gleysols), Hainan (Plinthosols), and Hubei (Lixisols) across China. The equilibrium oscillation method was used to study the adsorption-desorption behaviors of BH in the eight soils. The relationships between BH adsorption and soil physicochemical properties, environmental factors (temperature and initial solution pH), and other external conditions (addition of humic acid, biochar, and metal ions) were quantified. The adsorption-desorption parameters of BH in all soils were well fitted by the Freundlich model. The adsorption constant of BH varied between 0.066 and 4.728. The BH adsorption capacity decreased in the following order: Phaeozems Alisols > Ferralsols > Lixisols > Plinthosols > Anthrosols > Luvisols > Gleysols. The Freundlich adsorption and desorption constants of BH were linearly positively correlated with soil clay content (R-2 = 0.711 and 0.709; P = 0.009 and 0.009, respectively), organic carbon content (R-2 = 0.684 and 0.672; P = 0.011 and 0.013, respectively), and organic matter content (R-2 = 0.698 and 0.683; P = 0.010 and 0.011, respectively); however, their linear relationships with soil cation exchange capacity were not significant (R-2 = 0.192 and 0.192; P = 0.278 and 0.278, respectively). The adsorption and desorption constants of BH had negative, albeit not significant, correlations with soil pH (R-2 = 0.104 and 0.100; P = 0.437 and 0.445, respectively). The adsorption of BH by soil occurred spontaneously and was mainly based on physical adsorption. Either low or high temperature reduced the ability of the soil to adsorb BH. The addition of humic acid to the soil increased BH adsorption, while the addition of biochar increased the solution pH, resulting in decreased BH adsorption. Cation type and ionic strength also had strong effects on BH adsorption. With the exception of Phaeozems, BH exhibited intermediate or high mobility in the agricultural soils and thus poses risks to surface water and groundwater.

AB An increasing amount of Fluoranthene (Fla) and Benz(a)anthracene (BaA) is being produced and used, eventually entering the soil sediments. The accumulation of Fla and BaA will cause poisoning to typical enzymes (alpha-Amylase) and organisms (Eisenia fetida) in soil. However, the studies about exploring and comparing the different effects of Fla, BaA and their joint effect at different levels are rarely reported. In this paper, the different effects of Fla, BaA and their mixed pollutant on alpha-Amylase were evaluated and compared at the molecular level, and the effect of Fla-BaA to the antioxidant system of earthworm (Eisenia fetida) was investigated from the aspects of concentration and exposure time at the animal level. The results showed that Fla-BaA had the greatest influence on the skeleton structure and the microenvironment of amino acid residue of alpha-Amylase compared to Fla and BaA, and in the mixed pollutant system, the joint effect mode was additive mode. The inhibitory effect of Fla-BaA on the activity of alpha-Amylase was also stronger than that of the system alone. The assays at the animal level showed that low concentrations (below 5 mg/kg) of Fla-BaA increased the activity of GSH-Px and SOD while high concentrations inhibited their activity. The POD that was activated throughout the experiment period suggested its key role in the earthworm antioxidant system. Changes in T-AOC and MDA showed that long-term and high-dose of Fla-BaA exposure inhibited the antioxidant capacity of Eisenia fetida, causing lipid peroxidation and damage to cells.

AB The phytotoxicity caused by 500 mu M ZnSO4 center dot 7H(2)O and its detoxifying by co-application of 100 mu M of MT melatonin (MT) and glutathione (GSH) in 6-week-old safflower plants have been investigated. Reduced biomass production and total chlorophyll content on the one hand and increased content of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA) with increase in lipoxygenase activity, on the other hand, showed Zn- induced oxidative damage in safflower seedlings. When MT, GSH and especially MT + GSH exogenously were applied to Zn-stressed seedlings, the content of H2O2, MDA and the activity of lipoxygenase considerably decreased. In Zn-treated seedlings, the application of these signaling molecules led to a considerable increment in ascorbate (ASC), GSH and phytochelatin (PC) contents along with the induction of activity of antioxidant enzymes including ascorbate-glutathione cycle enzymes when compared with the plants stressed with Zn only. In Zn-stressed safflower seedlings treated with MT, GSH and MT + GSH, decreased activity of enzymes involved in glyoxalase system may be associated with the role of MT and GSH in reducing Zn uptake and reducing Zn-induced toxicity and subsequently, lower plant's defense responses. The data showed that the effects of MT and GSH, in particular, the combination of these two molecules in reducing Zn uptake and diminishing its accumulation in the shoots of safflower seedlings, and also the participation of MT and GSH on increasing plant ability to tolerate high amount of Zn through stimulation of various antioxidant defense systems suggest them as suitable candidates to better the survival of safflower in soils contaminated with Zn excess.

AB Technologies based on zero-valent iron (Fe-0) are increasingly being used to immobilize metals in soils and remove metals and nitrate from waters. However, the impact of nitrate reduction on metal immobilization in metal contaminated soils has been poorly investigated so far. Here, different concentrations of Fe-0 filings (1%, 2% and 5%; wt%) were applied to a metal contaminated soil. The resulting nitrate reduction and metal (Cd and Zn) immobilization was investigated using a column leaching experiment for 12 weeks. Corrosion of Fe-0 filings and precipitation of Fe oxyhydroxydes (FeOOH) on the surfaces of the filings were observed using SEM-EDS and EMPA-WDS at the end of the experiment. Compared to the untreated soil, total nitrate amounts released were lowered by 47%, 59% and 87% in the presence of 1%, 2% and 5% of Fe-0, respectively. Concomitantly with nitrate reduction, Cd and Zn concentrations in leachates were strongly alleviated in the presence of Fe-0, which was partly attributed to the rise of soil pH subsequent to nitrate reduction. More importantly, biotests with Lupinus albus L. revealed that the mechanisms involved in metal immobilization are stable to root-induced acidification. However, Fe-0 was not efficient to reduce Cd concentration in Lolium multiflorum Lam., indicating that root processes other than acidification may re-mobilize metals.

AB Xenobiotic mediated renal toxicity is one of the major health concerns to the organisms, including humans. New chemicals with nephrotoxic potential are continuously being added to the list of existing nephrotoxicants. To predict the nephrotoxicity of these new chemicals, reliable and cost-effective alternative animal models are required. It is a prerequisite for the identification and assessment of these compounds as potential nephrotoxicants to prevent renal toxicity in the exposed population. Drosophila melanogaster, a genetically tractable invertebrate animal model, has a renal system functionally analogous to humans. The Malpighian tubules (MTs) of D. melanogaster are similar to the tubular part of nephron of the human kidney. Besides, it recapitulates the renal toxicity hallmark with mammals when exposed to known nephrotoxicants. In this study, first instar larvae of D. melanogaster (Oregon R) were exposed to different concentrations of two well-known nephrotoxicants, cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg). Akin to higher organisms, Cd and Hg exposure to D. melanogaster produce similar phenotypes. MTs of exposed D. melanogaster larvae exhibited increased oxidative stress, activated cellular antioxidant defense mechanism, GSH depletion, increased cleaved caspase-3 expression, increased DEVDase activity and increased cell death. The functional status of MTs was assessed by fluid secretion rate (FSR), efflux activity of transporter protein, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), ATP level and expression of junctional protein (Dlg). All the phenotypes observed in MTs of D. melanogaster larvae recapitulate the phenotypes observed in higher organisms. Increased uric acid level, the hallmark of renal dysfunction, was also observed in exposed larvae. Taken together, the study suggests that MTs of D. melanogaster may be used as a functional model to evaluate xenobiotic mediated nephrotoxicity.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in the migration and transformation of nutrients and pollutants. Recently, DOM derived from biochar has the potential to determine the application of biochar and has attracted much researcher's attention. However, the effects of pyrolysis temperature on the composition evolution of DOM in manure-derived biochar are still unclear. In this study, DOM solutions extracted from a series of biochars derived from three kinds of manure (chicken, swine and dairy) at six pyrolysis temperature (200-700 degrees C) were analyzed using UV-Visible, Fourier transform infrared and fluorescence spectroscopy, aiming to investigate the effects of pyrolysis temperature on the composition evolution of DOM. The results showed that, with the increased of pyrolysis temperature, the dissolved organic matter (DOC) content sharply declined to reach stable. High DOC content was obtained at low pyrolysis temperature. Moreover, the DOM mainly contained humic acid-like and protein-like substances. With the pyrolysis temperature increased, the protein-like substances firstly decreased and then increased, while there was an opposite trend for the humic acid-like substances. Moreover, functional groups evolution of DOM depended on the pyrolysis temperature and manure type, evidenced by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with two-dimensional correlation analysis. This study highlights the importance of optical analysis and may provide valuable information regarding the characteristics evolution of biochar-derived DOM.

AB Hexavalent chromium (chromium (VI)), a highly toxic heavy metal, is a common pollutant of aquatic ecosystems. The present study aimed to elucidate the potential toxic effects of chromium (VI) on oxidative stress biomarkers and fatty acids profile in the gills and digestive gland of Venus verrucosa, an ecologically and economically important bivalve species. Three doses of chromium (VI) (1, 10 and 100 mu g.L-1) were chosen for V. verrucosa exposure during 7 days under controlled conditions. A significant increase in the levels of malondialdehyde, lipid hydroperoxides and hydrogen peroxide was observed in the gills and digestive gland of chromium (VI)-exposed V. verrucosa as compared to the control group. Furthermore, an induction of enzymatic antioxidant activities (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase) and an enhancement of non-enzymatic antioxidant levels (non-protein thiols, glutathione and vitamin C) were marked. An alteration of fatty acids composition was also noted following chromium (VI) exposure. The obtained results highlighted the importance of assessing oxidative damage biomarkers and fatty acids profile in the study of chromium (VI)-induced toxicity in V. verrucosa.

AB Tetracycline antibiotics spread in the environment constitute a real threat, causing risks that should be controlled. Retention/release of these compounds after interacting with soil components are the main process governing their entry into water bodies, plant uptake, and availability for soil microorganisms. In this work, batch-type experiments were performed to study adsorption/desorption of oxytetracycline (OTC) and chlortetracycline (CTC) in 63 crop soils. The Freundlich model satisfactory described adsorption curves, showing strong affinity of both antibiotics to soils, with adsorption coefficient (K-F(ads)) values between 1015 and 9733 Ln mu mol(1-n) kg(-1) for OTC, and between 1099 and 11344 Ln mu mol(1-n) kg(-1) for CTC. Desorption percentages were always lower than 10%, indicating that adsorption is highly irreversible. Furthermore, the desorption coefficient (K-F(des)) correlated positive and significantly with K-F(ads), showing that those soils characterized by higher adsorption were also those showing less desorption. Soil organic carbon (SOC) was the soil characteristic that most explained the variance of K-F, both for adsorption and desorption, which caused that soils with higher SOC scores showed higher adsorption and lower desorption for both antibiotics. Pedotransfer functions were developed for OTC and CTC, and resulted effective to satisfactory predict K-F(ads) and K-F(des) values. These equations would facilitate an easy identification of soils vulnerable to antibiotics pollution, which would allow to program appropriate management practices to decrease undesirable effects on the environment and on public health.

AB Atmospheric monitoring data of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) over a three-year period were collected from an urban site in Dalian, northeast China. The status of PAHs in the atmosphere in Dalian were evaluated by assessing concentration levels, congener profiles, seasonal trends, primary source, inhalation exposure and the risk of developing lung cancer risk. Average concentrations were recorded for 53 PAHs (95 +/- 40 ng/m(3)), 16 EPA priority PAHs (68 +/- 33 ng/m(3)), 26 alkylated PAHs (17 +/- 7.6 ng/m(3)) and 4 high-molecular-weight (302 Da) PAHs (1.3 +/- 1.3 ng/m(3)). Atmospheric PAH concentrations in winter were almost twice as high as those recorded in the summer, possibly due to enhanced local emissions and long-range transport of atmospheric PAHs during the winter. PAH congeners were dominated by phenatherene, fluoranthene, pyrene and fluorene, accounting for 46.0% of total Sigma(53)PAH concentrations. Ship/vehicle emission and mixed combustion were identified as the main sources of PAHs using diagnostic PAH concentration ratios and principal component analysis-multiple linear regression. Benzo(a)pyrene toxicity equivalent concentration had an average content of 32 +/- 37 ng/m(-3) over the sampling period, with dibenzo(a,h)anthracene (50.7%) and dibenzo(a,l)pyrene (26.4%) being the largest contributors. The risk of developing lung cancer due to inhalation exposure to outdoor PAHs was calculated at 12.0 parts per thousand using the overall population attributable fraction (PAF). Our results estimate that, due to PAH exposure in Dalian, the average excess lung cancer risk during a person's lifetime is 35.7 cancer cases per one million inhabitants.

AB Effect of water accommodated fractions (WAF) of #180 fuel oil on fixed carbon and nitrogen in microalgae was studied by stable isotopes. Platymonas helgolandica, Heterosigma akashiwo and Nitzschia closterium were exposed to five WAF concentrations for 96 h. The delta C-13 value of microalgae was significantly lower than that of the control group, indicated that carbon was limited in the WAF concentrations. The delta C-13 value of microalgae appeared peak valley at 48 h in control group, corresponding to the enhanced capacity in carbon fixation during microalgae photosynthesis. The physiological acclimation capacity of microalgae was revealed by the occurrence time when the delta 13C value was in peak valley, and thus the physiological acclimation capacity of microalgae decreased in the order of Nitzschia closterium > Heterosigma akashiwo > Platymonas helgolandica. Principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to the delta 13C value in order to verify the "hormesis" phenomenon in microalgae. The delta 13C value could discriminate between stimulatory effects at low doses and inhibitory effects at high doses. In addition, the present study also investigated the effect of the nitrogen on microalgae growth. Because microalgae could still absorb the NO3-N and release of NO2-N and NH4-N in present study, the nitrogen cycle in microalgae was in the equilibrium status. The delta N-15 value in microalgae exhibited no obvious change with the increasing of WAF concentrations at the same time. However, due to the enrichment of nitrogen, the delta N-15 value first increased gradually with the time and finally was stable. Overall, the fractionation of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes illustrated that the effect of carbon on the growth of microalgae was more prominent than nitrogen. Stable isotopes was used to investigate the influence of WAF on fixed carbon and nitrogen in microalgae growth, providing a fundamental theoretical guidance for risk assessment of marine ecological environment.

AB This work was conducted to study the effect of soil pH (4.0, 6.0, and 8.0) on the transport, fractionation, and oxidation of trivalent chromium [Cr(III)]. Variation in pH altered soil chemical and mineralogical properties such as zeta potential, cation exchange capacity and redox potential of natural soil. Breakthrough curves and batch sorption experiments coupled with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses demonstrated that the easy mobility of Cr(III) in pH 4.0 soil was dominated by the limited coordination effect. The high retention of Cr(III) in pH 8.0 soil was mainly ascribed to the hydrolysis. Incubation experiments indicated that the proportions of Cr in exchangeable fraction decreased with increasing of soil pH and incubation time, and kinetics analysis revealed that the time dependent transformation was controlled by mass transfer and chemical processes (e.g., hydrolysis, ion association). The XPS confirmed the oxidation of Cr(III) in pH 8.0 soil during the incubation period. Furthermore, the content of toxic hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] was positively associated with time and initial concentration of Cr(III) released. These results revealed the hazardousness of Cr(III) in soil contaminated simultaneously by inorganic acid and alkali.

AB The primary purpose of this study was to systematically explore the complete metabolic pathway and tolerance mechanism of strain DNB-S1 to dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and the effect of DBP on energy metabolism of DNB-S1. Here, DNB-S1, a strain of Pseudomonas sp. that was highly effective in degrading DBP, was identified, and differentially expressed metabolites and metabolic networks of DBP were studied. The results showed that the differentially expressed metabolites were mainly aromatic compounds and lipid compounds, with only a few toxic intermediate metabolites. It speculated that phthalic acid, salicylic acid, 3-hydroxybenzoate acid, 3-Carboxy-cis, cis-muconate, fumarypyravate were intermediate metabolites of DBP. Their up-regulation indicated that there were two metabolic pathways in the degradation of DBP (protocatechuate pathway and gentisate pathway), which had been verified by peak changes at 290 nm, 320 nm, 330 nm, and 375 nm in the enzymatic method. Also, aspartate, GSH, and other metabolites were up-regulation, indicating that DNB-S1 had a high tolerance to DBP and maintained cell homeostasis, which was also one of the essential reasons to ensure the efficient degradation of DBP. Altogether, this study firstly proposed two pathways to degrade DBP and comprehensively explored the effect of DBP on the metabolic function of DNB-S1, which enriched the study of microbial metabolism of organic pollutants, and which provided a basis for the application of metabolomics.

AB The biochemical responses of Bellamya aeruginosa as a dominant and widespread freshwater gastropod throughout China to waterborne cadmium (Cd) were investigated to explore the impacts of exposure concentration and duration in this potential sentinel species. After the 7 days' test of dosage-mortality relationship, gastropods were exposed for either 7 days at the LC50 (1.7 mg/L), the LC10 (0.7 mg/L) and 0.02 mg/L Cd, or 28 days at 0.02 mg/L Cd. A suite of biochemical indicators including metallothionein-like protein (MTLP), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), contents of tissue metal (Cd, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn), and the compartments of these metals bound to MTLP were examined. The treatment of 0.02 mg/L Cd led to the increase of Cd bound to MTLP (Cd-MTLP) levels, the decrease of GSH content, and the upregulation of CAT activity, but no induction of MTLP, indicating that the intrinsic MTLP and GSH worked together for the detoxification of Cd at the low exposure. When the exposure concentration increased, GSH was depleted severely and synthesis of MTLP was triggered, leading to a strong and significant relationship between MTLP level and Cd accumulation. At the lethal concentrations (1.7 mg/L), both MTLP induction and CAT activity were inhibited while the proportion of Cd-MTLP to total Cd were increased, suggesting more intrinsic MTLP were utilized to sequester free Cd ions. Therefore, the content of Cd-MTLP in digestive glands of B. aeruginosa was recommended as a reliable biomarker for Cd contamination.

AB Pollution with total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) is a global concern and particularly in coastal environments. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are regarded as the most toxic components of TPHs and they can also be derived from other sources. Fangcheng Port is considered as a representative emerging coastal city in China, but the status, sources, and hazards to organisms and humans with respect to contamination with PAHs and TPHs are unknown in the coastal regions of this area. Therefore, in this study, we cloned cytochrome P450 family genes (CYP1A1, CYP3A, and CYP4) and heat shock protein 70 gene (HSP70) in the clam Meretrix meretrix as well as optimizing the method for measuring the 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity. These molecular indicators and four specific physiological indexes were found to be appropriate biomarkers for indicating the harmful effects of PAHs and TPHs on clams after exposure to the crude oil water-soluble fraction. In field monitoring surveys, we found that the 2- and 3-ring PAHs were dominant in the clams whereas the 4- to 6-ring PAHs were dominant in the sediments at each site. The PAH levels (3.63-12.77 ng/g wet weight) in wild clams were lower, whereas the TPH levels (13.25-70.50 mu g/g wet weight) were higher compared with those determined previous in China and elsewhere. The concentrations of PAHs and TPHs in the sediments (19.20-4215.76 ng/g and 3.65-866.40 mu g/g dry weight) were moderate compared with those in other global regions. Diagnostic ratio analysis demonstrated that the PAHs were derived mainly from pyrogenic sources. The TPHs may have come primarily from industrial effluents, land and maritime transportation, or fishing activities. The Integrated Biomarker Response version 2 indexes indicated that the clams collected from site S5 exhibited the most harmful effects due to contamination by PAHs and TPHs. Human health risk assessments demonstrated that the risks due to PAHs and TPHs following the consumption of clams can be considered acceptable. Our results suggest that continuous monitoring of contamination by PAHs and TPHs is recommended in this emerging coastal city as well as assessing their human health risks.

AB The present study was conducted in order to assess the chemical composition of Laurus, its antioxidant activities, and benefit from the Laurus extract effect on neurotoxicity caused by lead acetate (Pb). Chemical profile was assayed by using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HR-MS). In this study, 40 male rats were divided into four groups (10 rats per each group): (1) control group, (2) Laurus group: rats treated with 250 mg/kg b. wt. of Laurus leaves extract, (3) Pb group: rats treated with 100 mg/kg b. wt. of lead acetate, (4) Pb + Laurus group: rats treated with 250 mg/kg b. wt. of Laurus leaves extract in addition to lead acetate for 30 days. At the end of experiment, some estimates were calculated from blood samples, brain tissue, and histological examination. The results showed that the extract is highly affluent in total flavonoids, total phenolic, and also has antioxidant activity. The LC-MS appeared a wide range of compounds in the extract. The oxidative stress resulted from exposure to lead acetate has been reported to cause reduction in body and brain weights, levels of RBCs, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), GSH, SOD, and CAT in addition to increase in levels of WBCs and MAD. Moreover, Laurus leaves extract notably lessened the biochemical changes caused by lead acetate in the blood, homogenate, and brain tissue (P < 0.05). The current study indicates the antioxidant activity of Laurus leaves extract and assumes that it has a defensive role against the oxidative damage caused by lead in a rat's brain.

AB As an environmentally sustainable bioelectrochemical technology, the microbial fuel cell (MFC) has attracted great attention. In this study, a three-chamber MFC (TC-MFC) was enhanced with different auxiliary reagents to remove heavy metals from soil. The results showed that the removal efficiency of heavy metals from soil increased with increasing auxiliary reagent concentration. When 1 mol/L citric acid, HCI, or acetic acid were used as an auxiliary reagent, the total copper (500 mg/kg) removal efficiency after 74 days of TC-MFC treatment was 3.89, 5.01 and 2.01 times that of the control group, respectively. The highest soil electrical conductivity (15.29 ms/cm), ionic heavy metal content (94.78%), electricity generation performance (363.04 mW h), and desorption stability of heavy metals were obtained when using 1 mol/L HCl as an auxiliary reagent, indicating that HCl was more suitable for the remediation of heavy metals in soil using a TC-MFC. Correlation analysis showed that the electricity generation of the TC-MFC was linearly related to the removal efficiency of heavy metals from soil (R-2 = 0.9296). At the same time, higher content of ionic heavy metals in the soil led to better migration of heavy metals under the internal electric field of the TC-MFC.

AB Cadmium exposure is associated with renal dysfunction. However, the outcome of renal function in subjects who have had a reduction in cadmium exposure for years has not been completely clarified, particularly for individuals with normal baseline renal function. In this study, we used a nomogram model to predict renal dysfunction after a reduction in cadmium exposure in subjects with normal baseline renal function. In 1998, a survey was performed in 790 subjects living in control and cadmium-polluted areas. A total of 497 subjects was followed up in 2006. 404 subjects with normal baseline urinary beta(2)-microglobulin (UBMG), 373 subjects with normal baseline urinary N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (UNAG) and 407 subjects with normal baseline urinary albumin (UALB) were included in this analysis. Cadmium in the blood (BCd) and urine (UCd) was detected using graphite-furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. A logistic regression model was used to identify potential predicting factors of renal function at follow-up. Nomograms were developed based on those predictive factors. Bootstrap self-sampling, calibration curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to quantify our modeling strategy. Adjusted and unadjusted logistic regression models both showed that age, BCd and UBMG or UNAG at baseline were independent risk factors for renal tubular dysfunction. Baseline age, sex, BCd and UNAG or UBMG or UALB were used to construct the nomogam. The internal validation showed that the C-index was 0.70-0.74 for predicting renal dysfunction. The area under the curve of the nomogram was 0.70-0.74. Decision curve analysis verified the predictive value of the nomogram. A nomogram may be a useful risk assessment tool for predicting the progress of renal function in a cadmium-exposed population with normal baseline kidney function.

AB To study the effects of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) on cadmium (Cd) accumulation and the physiological responses of the Cd hyperaccumulator Solanum nigrum and non-hyperaccumulator Solanum melongena, a pot experiment was conducted in soil containing 2 mg kg(-1) Cd in which different concentrations of IAA (0, 10, 20, or 40 mg L-1) were sprayed on plant leaves. The results showed that Cd accumulation in shoots of S. nigrum was significantly increased by 30% after the addition of 10 mg L-1 IAA under 2 mg kg(-1) Cd stress compared to that in the control, but shoot Cd accumulation showed no significant change in S. melongena after this IAA treatment. Additionally, the growth and the proline content in the two species were significantly increased by 20 mg L-1 IAA. The activities of peroxidase and catalase in leaves of S. nigrum and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in S. melongena were significantly increased and their malondialdehyde content was significantly decreased compared to those in the control. The root activity of S. nigrum was significantly improved after 10 and 20 mg L-1 IAA treatments, but no significant difference was observed in S. melongena. The correlation analysis results showed that the Cd concentration in leaves of S. nigrum was significantly and positively correlated with the carotenoid and proline contents, and there was also a significant positive correlation between the Cd concentration and SOD activity in leaves of S. melongena. Therefore, S. nigrum is an ideal plant for the phytoextraction of Cd-contaminated soil assisted by IAA. IAA promotes Cd accumulation in plant shoots by enhancing the accumulation of carotenoids and proline in S. nigrum and maintaining a high leaf SOD activity in S. metongena.

AB Numerous studies have demonstrated adverse effects on human health after exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, it is still not clear how the toxicological effects and the health risks vary among PM samples of different compositions and concentrations. In this study, we examined effects of region- and season-dependent differences of PM2.5 on cytotoxicity, and the contributions of PAHs, nitro-PAHs (N-PAHs) and hydroxy-PAHs (OH-PAHs) to PM2.5 toxicity by determining different toxicological indicators in three lung cell lines. The results illustrated significant differences in components concentrations and biological responses elicited by PM2.5 collected in different cities and seasons. The concentrations of most PAHs, N-PAHs and OH-PAHs were much higher in Taiyuan than in Guangzhou. PM2.5 from Taiyuan exhibited lower cell viability and higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) release on lung cells than those from Guangzhou. Specifically, PM2.5 collected in summer from Taiyuan caused higher levels of pro-inflammatory responses and oxidative potential than those collected in winter. The correlation analysis between 19 PAHs, 17 N-PAHs and 12 OH-PAHs and the measured indicators demonstrated that PAHs were more related to PM2.5-induced CCK-8 cytotoxicity and IL-6 release in Taiyuan while N-PAHs and OH-PAHs were more related to PM2.5-induced CCK-8 cytotoxicity and dithiothreitol (DTT)-based redox activity in Guangzhou, suggesting that the toxicity of PM2.5 from Taiyuan was mostly correlated with PAHs while the toxicity of PM2.5 from Guangzhou was closely associated with N-PAHs and OH-PAHs. These results revealed that composition differences in PM2.5 from different regions and seasons significantly accounted for the differences of their toxicological effects.

AB Arsenic is a toxic metalloid that can cause male reproductive malfunctions and is widely distributed in the environment. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxicity of arsenic trioxide (ATO) induced GC-1 spermatogonial (spg) cells. Our results found that ATO increased the levels of catalase (CAT) and malonaldehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), while decreasing glutathione (GSH) and the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC). Therefore, ATO triggered oxidative stress in GC-1 spg cells. In addition, ATO also caused severe mitochondria] dysfunction that included an increase in residual oxygen consumption (ROX), and decreased the routine respiration, maximal and ATP-linked respiration (ATP-L-R), as well as spare respiratory capacity (SRC), and respiratory control rate (RCR); ATO also damaged the mitochondrial structure, including mitochondrial cristae disordered and dissolved, mitochondria] vacuolar degeneration. Moreover, degradation of p62, LC3 conversion, increasing the number of acidic vesicle organelles (AVOs) and autophagosomes and autolysosomes are demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of ATO may be associated with autophagy. Meanwhile, the metabolomics analysis results showed that 20 metabolites (10 increased and 10 decreased) were significantly altered with the ATO exposure, suggesting that maybe there are the perturbations in amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. We concluded that ATO was toxic to GC-1 spg cells via inducing oxidative stress, mitochondria] dysfunction and autophagy as well as the disruption of normal metabolism. This study will aid our understanding of the mechanisms behind ATO-induced spermatogenic toxicity.

AB Prostate cancer is one of the primary causes of death around the world. As an important drug, flutamide has been used in the clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer. However, the over dosage and improper discharge of flutamide could affect the living organism. Thus, it necessary to develop the sensor for detection of flutamide with highly sensitivity. In this paper, we report the synthesis of lanthanum cobaltite decorated halloysite nanotube (LCO/HNT) nanocomposite prepared by a facile method and evaluated for selective reduction of flutamide. The as prepared LCO/HNT nanocomposite shows the best catalytic performance towards detection of flutamide, when compared to other bare and modified electrodes. The good electrochemical performance of the LCO/HNT nanocomposite modified electrode is ascribed to abundant active sites, large specific surface area and their synergetic effects. Furthermore, the LCO/HNT modified electrode exhibits low detection limit (0.002 mu M), wide working range (0.009-145 mu M) and excellent selectivity with remarkable stability. Meaningfully, the developed electrochemical sensor was applied in real environmental samples with an acceptable recovery range.

AB The neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid (ACT) and seven pesticides [abamectin (ABA), emamectin benzoate (EMB), dicrotophos (DIC), bifenthrin (BIF), cypermethrin (CYP), lambda-cyhalothrin (LCY) and tetraconazole (TET)] are widely applied agrochemicals worldwide. Since most previous studies on these pesticides are performed merely based on toxicity tests with individual active ingredients, only finite knowledge is available on the mixture toxicities of these formulated compounds to crop pollinators. In this study, we examined their toxicities of binary, ternary, quatemary, quinquenary, senary, septenary and octonary mixtures to honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) with feeding toxicity test. Results showed that EMB and ABA had the highest toxicities to A. mellifera with LC50 values of 0.033 (0.028-0.038) and 0.047 (0.039-0.056) mu g a. i. mL(-1) after exposure for 7 days, respectively, followed by DIC with an LC50 value of 1.22 (1.01-1.41) mu g a. i. mL(-1). In contrast, relatively low toxicities were found from pyrethroid insecticides, ACT, and TET with their LC50 values ranged from 44.76 (38.75-50.89) to 251.7 (198.4-297.3) mu g a. i. mL(-1) Most of pesticide mixtures containing ACT and TET elicited synergistic interactions to honey bees. Besides, four pesticide mixtures of ACT + BIF, ACT + BIF + CYP, ACT + BIF + LCY and ACT + CYP + DIC + EMB also displayed synergistic effects. Among 98 tested binary to octonary mixtures of ACT in combination with seven pesticides, 44.90% of combinations exhibited synergistic effects on honey bees. Considering ACT was permitted to use on flowering crops, more attention should be paid to its application in the fields due to the synergistic effects of ACT in combination with other pesticides on A. mellifera under laboratory conditions.

AB Understanding how environmental pollutants influence plant occurrence, growth, and development is key for effective management plans and potential bioremediation. Rare plants, such as orchids, may occur in modified habitats and on soils containing heavy metals, yet their ecological and physiological responses to heavy metals is poorly understood. We investigated the influence of heavy metal pollution on orchid growth rates and interactions with soil fungal mutualists by comparing a large population of the orchid Epipactis helleborine (L.) Crantz subsp. tremolsii (Pau) E. Klein that grows on mine tailings in south-west Sardinia (Italy) with a population that grows on non-contaminated soils in central Sardinia. Soils of the contaminated site had high levels of heavy metals and low organic matter and nutritive elements content. We performed a morphological analysis on twenty individuals that have been subjected to measurement of bioaccumulation and translocation of heavy metals. Fungi associated with the roots of plants from the contaminated and uncontaminated site were grown and identified by DNA barcoding approach. Plants from the contaminated site were smaller than the ones growing in the uncontaminated site and were found to be able to tolerate heavy metals from the soil and to accumulate and translocate them into their organs. Fungi belonging to the genus Ilyonectria (Ascomycota) were found both in contaminated and uncontaminated sites, while an unidentified fungus was isolated from roots in the contaminated site only. These results are discussed in terms of orchids' tolerance to heavy metals and its physiological and ecological mechanisms. The role of contaminated habitats in harbouring orchids and peculiar taxa is also discussed.

AB Eastern China is a typical region that suffers from harmful cyanobacterial blooms. Numerous studies have focused on bloom formation mechanisms; however, the detailed mechanisms remained unclear. Our study explored the influence of four metal ions (Ca, Cu, Pb and Cd) on Microcystis aeruginosa to determine their effects on bloom formation. We found that Ca concentrations higher than 100 mg L-1 contributed to cyanobacterial bloom formation. The presence of Ca triggered the anti-oxidation process and promoted the secretion of extracellular polysaccharides, thus inducing aggregation of algal cells and enhancing their buoyancy 2.1-fold more than the control (p < 0.05). The reverse regulation of dissolved CO2 to bicarbonate by carbonic anhydrase formed a large amount of carbonate and decreased the growth rate by 38-56%. Cu (> 0.1 mg L-1) presented significant toxicity to algal cells while Pb (> 1 mg L-1) suppressed the algal growth rate due to the acidic condition. Cd (< 0.1 mg L-1) exhibited no apparent toxicity to the algae. Furthermore, as the buoyancy increased, Cd was likely to facilitate the formation of cyanobacterial blooms, which needs further research. These findings can provide a theoretical basis for eutrophic lake management and contribute to the development of water quality and wastewater discharge standards.

AB We collected surface sediments from the Chaobai river, the dominant source of drinking water for Beijing, China, to assess the status of contamination by polychlorinated biphenyls and evaluate their sources. Total concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls in the sediments ranged from 0.125 to 70.6 ng/g dry weight and correlated with the locations relating to painting operation such as printing factories and construction material markets. Dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls were present and corresponded with constituents of commercial polychlorinated biphenyl mixtures. Principal component analysis indicated two dominant sources of polychlorinated biphenyls in the sediments-deposition from airborne emissions and point-source pollution from factories. An ecological risk assessment concluded that there was only slight polychlorinated biphenyl pollution in the sediments of the Chaobai river, which was not likely to induce adverse biological effects. Our findings provide information for polychlorinated biphenyl risk assessment and recognition of the dominant sources of these compounds in drinking water in China.

AB Mn3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are used increasingly in various fields due to their excellent physiochemical properties. Previous studies have documented that Mn-based nanomaterials resulted in excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and dopamine (DA) reduction both in vivo and in vitro experiments. However, little is known about the mechanism of ROS production and DA decrease induced by Mn-based nanomaterials. The present study was carried out to elucidate the mechanism of the co-incubation model of dopaminergic neuron PC12 cells and the synthesized Mn3O4 NPs. The results demonstrated that exposure to Mn3O4 NPs reduced cell viability, increased level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triggered oxidative stress and induced apoptosis. Notably, the level of ROS was remarkably increased (> 10-fold) with Mn3O4 NPs exposure. We also found that mitochondrial calcium Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) was up-regulated and the mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](mito)) increased induced by Mn3O4 NPs in PC12 cells. Furthermore, the MCU inhibitor RuR significantly attenuated Mn3O4 NPs-induced [Ca2+](mito), ROS production and apoptosis. In PC12 cells, the decrease of DA content was mainly due to the downregulation of DOPA decarboxylase (DDC) expression caused by Mn3O4 NPs treatment. The expression of proteins related to DA storage system was not significantly affected by treatment.

AB Iron and steel production is one of the main anthropogenic sources of mercury (Hg) emission and release. Oxidized and particulate Hg discharged from iron and steel enterprises deposit into the surrounding soil, which accumulate and introduce environmental risks. Therefore, it is important to assess Hg pollution in the soil surrounding iron and steel enterprises. In this study, the Hg pollution, Hg distribution from steel plants and Hg fractionation in farmland soil around five typical steel plants were analysed in Tangshan of China. The Hg pollution indexes (Pi) of more than 90% soil samples were greater than 3 by the single factor pollution index method, which showed that most soil samples around the five steel plants were strongly contaminated by Hg. The Hg contents in soil increased first and then decreased, and the maximum content presented at 250-300 m away from the boundary of the steel plants. The order of Hg fraction proportion in the soil samples was extractable (35%-43%) > volatile (24%-36%) > residual (10%-26%) > reducible (0-15%) > oxidizable (0-12%). The distribution of Hg fraction in farmland soil had no regular trend with the distance from the steel plants. The volatile Hg and extractable Hg were dominant in farmland soil, and their combined proportion was greater than 60%. These two fractions of Hg are at risk of re-volatilization into the atmosphere or potential absorption by plants.

AB Drinking water samples were collected from 71 cities, including 28 provincial capital cities or municipalities, 20 prefecture cities and 23 counties, of 31 provincial-level administrative regions in China from July to August in 2017. Futhermore, 24 Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs), 16S rRNA and 2 integrase genes were quantified by qPCR to investigate the pollution degree of ARGs. The results revealed that the 16S ranged from 105 108 copies/100 mL in the drinking water, and its treatment process could effectively remove bacteria. Moreover, sulfonamides-ARGs were the most prevalent ARGs in the drinking water of China, and the abundance of bla(TEM) ranked top five in all cities among the selected ARGs, indicating that the pollution condition of the genes should be aroused more attention. The data of qPCR and correlation analyses indicated that intl1 played a more crucial role than intl2 in the propagation of ARGs in the drinking water. Additionally, the pollution degree of ARGs among different city types showed no significant difference.

AB The presence of pesticides in water has emerged as a momentous environmental issue over the past decades. Herein, a terbium doped Ti/PbO2 (denoted as Ti/PbO2-Tb) dimensionally stable Ti/PbO2-Tb anode has been successfully prepared by one-step electrodeposition path for electrocatalytic degradation of imidacloprid (IMD) wastewater with high efficiency. Ti/PbO2-Tb electrode presents higher oxygen evolution potential, lower charge transfer resistance, stronger stability, longer service lifetime and outstanding electrocatalytic activity than Ti/PbO2 electrode. The optimum condition for IMD oxidation is obtained by analyzing the effects of some critical operating parameters including temperature, initial pH, current density and electrolyte concentration. It is proved that 70.05% of chemical oxygen demand and 76.07% of IMD are removed after 2.5 h of degradation under current density of 8 mA cm(-2), pH 9, temperature 30 degrees C and 7.0 g L-1 NaCl electrolyte. In addition, the electrode displays commendable energy saving property as well as favorable reusability. The degradation mechanism of IMD is proposed by analyzing the intermediates identified by LC-MS. The present research provides a feasible strategy to degrade IMD wastewater by Ti/PbO2-Tb electrode.

AB The germination and seedling vigor of crops is negatively affected by soil salinity. Nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as a key molecule involved in many physiological events in plants. The objective of present study was to evaluate the impact of exogenous sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a NO donor) at different concentrations on the seed germination and early seedling growth characteristics of pakchoi (Brassica chinensis L.) under NaCl stress. 100 mM NaC1 stress markedly inhibited the seed germination potential, germination index, vitality index and growth of radicles and plumules. SNP pretreatment attenuated the salt stress effects in a dose-dependent manner, as indicated by enhancing the characteristics of seed germination and early seedling growth parameters, and the mitigating effect was most pronounced at 10 mu M SNP. Efficient antioxidant systems were activated by SNP pretreatment, and which effectively increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and reduced contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the production rate of superoxide anion radical (O-2(center dot)) in radicles and plumules, thereby preventing oxidative damage from NaCl stress. SNP pre-treatment also increased the contents of proline and soluble sugar in radicles and plumules under NaCl stress. In addition, SNP pre-treatment significantly increased the K+ contents and decreased Na+ contents in radicles and plumules, resulting in the increased level of K+/Na+ ratio. Our results demonstrated that SNP application on pakchoi seeds may be a good option to improve seed germination and seedling growth under NaCl stress by modulating the physiological responses resulting in better seed germination and seedling growth.

AB The aim of the present study was to provide an integrated view of algal removal of diclofenac (DCF). Two isolated microalgal strains Picocystis sp. and Graesiella sp. were cultivated under different DCF concentrations and their growth, photosynthetic activity and diclofenac removal efficiency were monitored.
   Results showed that DCF had slight inhibitory effects on the microalgal growth which did not exceed 21% for Picocystis and 36% for Graesiella after 5 days. Both species showed different patterns in terms of removal efficiency. In presence of Picocystis sp., the amounts of removed DCF were up to 73%, 43% and 25% of 25, 50 and 100 mg L-1 respectively; whereas only 52%, 28% and 24% were removed in the presence of Graesiella at same DCF tested concentrations. DCF removal was insured mainly by biodegradation. To better reveal the mechanism involved, metabolites analyses were performed. Two DCF biodegradation/biotransformation products were detected in presence of Picocystis.
   This study indicated that Picocystis performed a satisfactory growth capacity and DCF removal efficiency and thus could be used for treatment of DCF contaminated aqueous systems.

AB Biological strategy of utilization of plants-microbe's interactions to remediate cadmium (Cd) contaminated soils is effective and practical. However, limited evidence at transcriptome level is available about how microbes work with host plants to alleviate Cd stress. In the present study, comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed between maize seedlings inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and non-AM fungi inoculation under distinct concentrations of CdCl2 (0, 25, and 50 mg per kg soil). Significantly higher levels of Cd were found in root tissues of maize colonized by AM fungi, whereas, Cd content was reduced as much as 50% in leaf tissues when compared to non-AM seedlings, indicating that symbiosis between AM fungi and maize seedlings can significantly block translocation of Cd from roots to leaf tissues. Moreover, a total of 5827 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were determined and approximately 68.54% DEGs were downregulated when roots were exposed to high Cd stress. In contrast, 67.16% (595) DEGs were significantly up-regulated when seedlings were colonized by AM fungi under 0 mg CdCl2. Based on hierarchical clustering analysis, global expression profiles were split into eight distinct clusters. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that hundreds of genes functioning in plant hormone signal transduction, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and glutathione metabolism were enriched. Furthermore, MapMan pathway analysis indicated a more comprehensive overview response, including hormone metabolism, especially in JA, glutathione metabolism, transcription factors and secondary metabolites, to Cd stress in mycorrhizal maize seedlings. These results provide an overview, at the transcriptome level, of how inoculation of maize seedlings by AM fungi could facilitate the relief of Cd stress.

AB Potentially toxic metal (PTM) pollution in road dust is of great concern, however, our understanding of PTMs released by pyrotechnic displays and their adverse impacts on human health in road dust is limited. Here, we studied PTM pollution levels and Pb isotope signatures in pyrotechnic ash and road dust (aged dust and pyrotechnic-influenced dust) samples from eight cities in China during Chinese New Year and carried out a human health risk assessment. Pyrotechnic ash had higher values of Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Sr and Pb but lower values of Mn and Cd than Chinese background soil. Pyrotechnic-influenced dust had significantly higher Cu and Cr values than aged dust, with enrichment of Sr, Cu, Pb, Cr and Ni in road dust after pyrotechnic displays. Both Pb-208/Pb-20(6) and Sr values were used to confirm the presence of pyrotechnic ash in road dust. A positive matrix factorization demonstrated that pyrotechnic events contributed 70.1%, 50.4%, 36.6% and 35.5% of the Sr, Cu, Cr and Pb values to these road dust, respectively. We found that non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks related to PTMs in road dust were at safe levels during the Chinese New Year, although both risks were elevated following pyrotechnic events. Typically, PTM pollutants related to pyrotechnic events contributed 33.99% to non-carcinogenic and 21.83% to carcinogenic risks, suggesting that more attention needs to be paid to this source of PTM pollution in China. Current results improve our understanding of PTM pollution in pyrotechnic-influenced road dust and health risks related to pyrotechnic displays in China.

AB Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is the most widely distributed and harmful variant toxins released by cyanobacteria, which poses potential threaten to people and aquatic animals when entering natural water. In our research, solar/chlorine process was comprehensively investigated to degrade and detoxify MC-LR. Under the chlorine concentration of 1.0 mg L-1, MC-LR (1.0 mu M) was decreased by 96.7%, 26%, and 9% by solar/chlorine process, chlorination, and solar irradiation respectively. Quenching experiments confirmed that reactive chlorine species (RCS) and hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) were the predominant reactive species in solar/chlorine process at neutral condition, and ozone was generated because of the participation of triplet-state oxygen (O(P-3)). The respective contributions of each reactive species were calculated with the order as: RCS, HO center dot, ozone, and solar irradiation. The presence of HCO3- and natural organic matter in water inhibited the degradation efficiency of MC-LR. Moreover, the transformation products of MC-LR generated during the solar/chlorine process were identified and a possible pathway was proposed. The hepatotoxicity of MC-LR and its transformation products was compared using protein phosphatase 2A. Our experimental results revealed that the concentration and hepatotoxicity of MC-LR both significantly decreased, and most products were not hepatoxic. Overall, the solar/chlorine process is a promising alternative technology to degrade MC-LR during eutrophication.

AB The contamination of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in the Baiyangdian Lake has exacerbated readily since 2008. This study analyzed the perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs) in the surface water, sediment, and fish of the Baiyangdian Lake. In the surface water, the total concentration of PFASs ranged in 1193-3462 ng L-1 (mean 1734 ng L-1) in the rainy season and 469-1724 ng L-1 (mean 876 ng L-1) in the dry season. The total concentration of PFASs in the sediment ranged in 1.97-13.3 ng g(-1) (mean 6.53 ng g(-1)). It was found that PFCAs and PFSAs with longer chains were more easily adsorbed in the sediment. Among the collected fish samples, the enrichment of PFASs in the tissues fell in the order of liver > cheek > muscle. For the muscle, stomach, and liver tissues of the fish samples, significant correlations existed between the delta N-15 values and the concentration of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). The contents of PFOS and perfiuorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the fish were not at a level high enough to significantly risk human health.

AB Cadmium (Cd) is a serious threat to plants health. Though some genes have been reported to get involved in the regulation of tolerance to Cd, the mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood. Na+/H+ antiporter (NHX1) plays an important role in Na+/H+ trafficking. The salt and cadmium stress tolerance were found to be enhanced by NHX1 in duckweed according to our previous study, however, its function in Cd2+ flux under Cd stress has not been studied.
   Here we explored the Cd2+ flux in wild type (WT) and NHX1 transgenic duckweed (NHX1) under Cd stress. We found that the Cd2+ influx in NHX1 duckweed was significantly declined, followed by an increased Cd2+ efflux after 20 min treatment of Cd, which resulted a less accumulation of Cd in NHX1.
   Reversely, inhibition of NHX1 by amiloride treatment, enhanced Cd2+ influx in NHX1 duckweed, subsequently delayed Cd2+ efflux in both genotypes of duckweed under Cd2+ shock. H+ efflux in NHX1 duckweed was lower compare with that in WT with 20 min Cd2+ shock. NHX1 also increased the pH value with Cd2+ stress in the transgenic rhizoid. These finding suggested a new function of NHX1 in regulation of Cd2+ and H+ flow during short-term Cd2+ shock.

AB In Chinese Lake Taihu, the algal quantity was significantly larger in summer than late spring (p < 0.01). In summer, compared with the dredged area including neither zoobenthos nor submerged macrophytes, the algal biomass and density were significantly lower in the area filled with the submerged macrophytes. Interestingly, the minimum algal bloom was observed in the combined area containing submerged macrophytes and zoobenthos, which was due to the synergistic interaction between the zoobenthos and the macrophytes. The metabolite extracts from the numerically dominant zoobenthos Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri had significant algal inhibitory effects of Microcystis aeruginosa, and displayed stimulatory effects on seed germination, seedling growth, and peroxidase activity of the prevalent submerged macrophyte Potamogeton malaianus. 27 active compounds in the worm metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Among these compounds three chemicals arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and linoleic acid with concentrations of 13.92 +/- 1.11, 10.57 +/- 2.52, 2.75 +/- 0.73 mg/kg dry weight, respectively, were confirmed as the typical allelochemicals with algal inhibition potential. In short, the metabolites allelopathy of L. hoffineisteri can form and assist the synergistic effect between L. hoffineisteri and P. malaianus on algal suppression. Thus, it is feasible to simultaneously restore submerged macrophytes and zoobenthos community in the disturbed eutrophic lakes for removing harmful algae.

AB The present study was focused on the application of an electrochemical oxidation process combined with biodegradation for the removal of novel Herbicidal Ionic Liquids (HILs)-promising protection plant products which incorporate herbicidal anions and ammonium cations. The influence of carbon chain length (n = 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18) in the dialkyldimethylammonium cations on electrochemical oxidation kinetics, degradation efficiency and biodegradation by activated sludge was investigated. It was established that the applied cation influenced the heterogeneous rate constant and diffusion coefficient of electrochemical oxidation. The oxidation efficiency ranged from 17% in case of HILs with C8 alkyl chain to approx. 60% in case of HILs comprising C14 and C16 alkyl chains after 3 h of electrochemical treatment. Subsequent biodegradation studies revealed that electrochemical oxidation improved the mineralization efficiency of the studied HILs. The mineralization efficiency of electrochemically-treated HILs ranged from 28% in case of HILs comprising the C8 alkyl chain to 57% in case of HILs with C14 and C16 alkyl chains after 28 days. In case of untreated HILs, the corresponding mineralization efficiency ranged from 0 to 8%, respectively. This confirms the feasibility of a hybrid electrochemical-biological approach for treatment of herbicidal ionic liquids based on MCPA.

AB Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are extensively used in humans and animals, which have aroused wide attention due to the emergence of FQ resistant bacteria and frequent detection in water, sediment and organism. However, little information is available about the bioconcentration and tissue distribution of FQs in fish. In the present study, we investigated the uptake and depuration of eight FQs (balofloxacin (BAL), enoxacin (ENO), enrofloxacin (ENR), fleroxacin (FLE), lomefloxacin (LOM), moxifloxacin (MOX), ofloxacin (OFL), sparfloxacin (SPA)) in common carp under controlled laboratory conditions. The results showed that all target FQs could accumulate in fish tissues, and had a similar tendency over time during the whole uptake and depuration periods. The uptake rate constant (k(1)), depuration rate constant (k(2)) and half-lives (t(1/2)) were in the ranges of 0.007-3.599 L/(kg.d), 0.051-0.283 d(-1) and 2.4-10.7 d, respectively. The ranges of bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were 0.24-39.55 L/kg, 0.21-24.97 L/kg and 0.04-1.07 L/kg in liver, kidney and muscle, respectively. BCFs of eight FQs decreased in the order: MOX > ENR > ENO approximate to BAL approximate to FLE approximate to OFL approximate to LOM approximate to SPA, which may be correlated with the substituents at positions 7 and 8 of the basic quinolone nucleus and the metabolic capacity. Besides, BCFs were relative with pH-adjusted distribution coefficient (log D), suggesting that molecular status of ionizable compounds strongly influenced the bioconcentration processes. The present study provides important insights for understanding the bioconcentration and tissues distribution of FQs.

AB In the present study, we compared the toxicity and associated chemical characterizations of flowback and produced water (FPW) collected from a single horizontal hydraulically fractured well at different time points during FPW production. Since few studies on whole mixture toxicity related to FPW exist, our aims were to determine both overall toxicity of the FPW mixture in a suite of organisms (Daphnia magna, Lumbriculus variegatus, Danio rerio, and Oncorhynchus mykiss) and also determine if toxicity changes depending on variation in FPW chemical properties as a function of time sampled (1.33, 72, and 228 h FPW samples collected immediately post-well production onset were analyzed in current study). FPW chemical composition was determined via quadra-pole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS), full-scan high performance liquid chromatography/Orbitrap mass spectrometry (HPLC/Orbitrap-MS), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We observed that FPW sampled later in the production process contained higher ion and total dissolved solids concentrations, whereas the highest concentrations of dissolved organic compounds were observed in the earliest FPW sample analyzed. Toxicity associated with FPW exposure was deemed to be species-specific to a certain extent, but general trends revealed the earliest FPW sampled contained highest toxic potential. Accordingly, we theorize that although the saline conditions of FPW are the foremost toxicological drivers to freshwater organisms, dissolved organics associated with FPW significantly contribute to the overall toxicity of exposed organisms.

AB Soil ecosystems surrounding chromium slag undergo continuous harsh physicochemical conditions due to multiple heavy metals contamination. Previous studies of soil microbial communities mainly focused on surface soil layer, while little was known about the depth-related distributions of the microbial communities in chromium (Cr)-contaminated soil. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of depth-related distributions of microbial communities in Cr-contaminated soil was carried out by Illumina sequencing of 16s rRNA genes. The results revealed that bacterial diversities at 0 cm depth layer were significantly higher than those below 20 cm depths. And there was a remarkable difference in bacterial compositions along with the sampling depths especially for the dominant phyla of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Fimicutes (p < 0.05). While the archaea accounted for a relatively low proportion of the microbes and showed stability in the compositions with the predominant phyla of Thaumarchneota and Euryarchaeota. The linear discriminate analysis (LDA) and effect size (LEfSe) analysis showed that there were thirty-seven kinds of biomarker microbes existing in the five soil layers with LDA threshold of 4.0, and each layer showed distinct microbial divisions, indicating that microbes with different biological functions might survive along with the sampling depths. The environmental variables including total chromium (Cr), Cr(VI), Mn, Ni, and Zn had considerable influences on microbial community composition in the contaminated soil. A total of 25 Cr(VI)-reducing strains were further isolated and identified, which were phylogenetically affiliated to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Among the isolated Cr (VI)-reducing strains, Bacillus stratosphericus was the first time to be reported with Cr(VI) reducing capacity.

AB Neonicotinoids act as agonists on the nicotinic Acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in insect brains, an essential molecular component of central brain structures involved in learning and memory formation. Sublethal doses might, therefore, impair neural processes necessary for adaptive experience dependent behaviour and thus reduce the fitness of pollinating insects on the individual and community level.
   First, the question was addressed whether clothianidin has an aversive taste for honey bees and concluded with both a laboratory and a semi-field experiment that bees are unable to distinguish between control and contaminated sucrose solutions. In the laboratory, proboscis extension response conditioning was performed with forager bees exposed to different concentrations of clothianidin (0.1, 0.3 and 0.8 ng/bee) before learning, after learning during memory consolidation, and just before memory retention. These tests at different timings allowed uncovering an impairment of the consolidation and retrieval of memory due to the exposure to clothianidin. It was concluded that an acute exposure to clothianidin has an adverse effect on memory processing in honey bees.

ID SUFFICIENT; TOXICITY; DYNAMICS; MODEL
AB In the higher tiers of pesticide risk assessment, the Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) concept is often used to establish the effect threshold defined as the concentration protecting 95% of the species (Hazardous Concentration 5%, HC5). The toxicity data included in SSDs are normally established using a constant exposure regime. However, the exposure of pesticides in the field is often characterised by a variable exposure regime. Toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) models can be used to extrapolate the toxic effects of a chemical to a specific, time-variable exposure regime. The aim of this paper was to develop Exposure Pattern Specific SSDs (EPS-SSDs) for three insecticides using TKTD models and to compare the HC5 of different exposure patterns with the same time-weighted average concentration to evaluate whether the use of EPS-SSDs would change the outcome of the ecological risk assessment. The EPS-SSDs were developed by estimating TKTD parameters for the compounds chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid and lambda-cyhalothrin using results from standard, 96 h, single species tests. These parameter estimates were used for TKTD modelling to determine toxicity thresholds (e.g. LC10 and LC50) for contrasting exposure patterns after certain evaluation times (4, 10 or 100 days). HC5 values were constructed with TKTD-predicted LC10- and LC50- values for different exposure patterns characterised by similar time-weighted average concentrations. Differences between those HC5 values ranged from a factor 1 to a factor 2.3 for the short evaluation period (4 d). This difference was smaller when using an evaluation period of 10 days instead of 4 days and selecting the TKTD-predicted LC10 instead of TKTD-predicted LC50 based HC5s. For the long term evaluation period (100 d), a maximum difference of a factor of 30 was found.

AB Ammonia emissions is an important issue during composting because it can cause secondary pollution and a significant of nitrogen loss. Based on research adding Bacillus stearothermophilus can reduce ammonia emissions during composting because it can use sugar in organic matter fermentation to produce organic acids over 50 degrees C. This study conducted the batch experiments by adding different concentrations of Bacillus stearothermophilus to reduce the ammonia emissions and find out its characteristic during layer manure composting by using an aerobic composting reactor with sawdust as a bulking agent. The results show that the application of Bacillus stearothermophilus can accelerate the rate of temperature and significantly decrease pH, the warming period was 2 days in the treatment with Bacillus stearothermophilus, while it was 4 days in the treatment without Bacillus stearothermophilus. Ammonia emissions were mainly occurred in warming and high temperature period during composting. The ammonia emissions in the treatment with 8.00 g/kg initial Bacillus stearothermophilus were significantly lower than the other lower Bacillus stearothermophilus treatment and control during composting (p < 0.05), and it can significantly increase ammonium-nitrogen and nitrate-nitrogen concentration, reduce pH (p < 0.05), but the average number of Bacillus stearothermophilus copies in treatment with different initial Bacillus stearothermophilus concentration had no significant difference (p > 0.05). MiSeq System Sequencing results find that the addition of Bacillus stearothermophilus changed the bacterial community structure under warming and high-temperature periods during composting, increased the relative abundance of lactic acid bacillus and nitrification bacteria. Therefore, the reason for the low ammonia emission in 8.00 g/kg initial Bacillus stearothermophilus treatments might be not only due to the Bacillus stearothermophilus itself, but also Bacillus stearothermophilus can change the indigenous microorganism community, including increase the relative content of lactic acid Bacillus and nitrification bacteria, thus reducing the pH and promoting nitrification, and reducing ammonia emissions.

AB Nitrogen (N) plays crucial roles in chlorophyll concentration, photosynthesis, and stress tolerance of plant leaves. This study conducted a greenhouse experiment combined with Cd and N treatments to elucidate the mechanism underlying the influence of N on Cd accumulation and acclimation strategy in Populus leaves. Chlorophyll concentration and net photosynthetic rates (A) in leaves were unaltered by Cd exposure regardless of N condition. Nitrogen availability alter acclimation strategy of poplar leaves under cadmium exposure. Under sufficient N, Cd accumulation in leaves was elevated with increased intensity and duration of Cd exposure; Cd accumulation reached ca. 28 mu g g(-1) dry weight and 260 mu g plant(-1) after 60 days of exposure to high level of Cd (20 mg Cd kg(-1) soil), and this finding indicates a large potential for Cd phytoextraction. Poplar leaves exhibited high capacity for antioxidant defense and stress tolerance and avoided oxidative damage under high Cd exposure. The levels of phytohormones and antioxidants in leaves and the relative expressions of critical genes encoding antioxidant enzymes were up-regulated under sufficient N condition. Nitrogen deficiency decreased chlorophyll concentration and net photosynthetic rates (A) and interfered with the production of N metabolites, resulting in a low level of phytohormones and antioxidants that are responsible for stress tolerance. The low levels of Cd accumulation in leaves may be a self-protecting strategy to prevent severe oxidative damage due to the decreased capacities for stress tolerance under N deficiency.

AB Using of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has emerged as a new technique to alleviate the toxic metals stress through changing their chemical behavior. The present work was conducted as a factorial arrangement based on a completely randomized design to study the inoculation effects of Glomus intraradices, Glomus mosseae and Glomus etunicatutn, on Pb and Zn fractions in the rhizosphere of alfalfa by using rhizobox technique in two agricultural soils with different Zn and Pb concentrations [with low (LH) and high (HH) concentration levels]. The results showed that AMF colonization promoted plant growth and lowered the shoot and root Pb and shoot Zn concentrations in the studied soils compared to uninoculated treatments. Mycorrhizal colonization significantly increased the Ca(NO3)(2)-extractable Zn and ORG-Zn (respectively 500 and 59.6% more than the uninoculated treatment) and decreased the OXI-Zn (20.32% less than the none inoculated treatment) in the HH soil. By contrast, mycorrhizae slightly increased the CARB, OXI and ORG-Zn forms in the LH soil compared to the uninoculation condition. In the AMF-treated HH soil, an increase was recorded in the Ca(NO3)(2)-extractable Pb, EXCH-Pb and GARB-Pb (respectively, 17.65, 3.09 and 14.22% compared to the none inoculated treatment) and a decrease in the OXI and ORG-Pb forms (respectively, 28.79 and 13.51% compared to the uninoculated treatment). A reverse status was observed for Pb changes in the LH soil. Depending on the contamination level, the mycorrhizal inoculation differentially affected the Pb and Zn fractions at different distances from the root surface. In the LH soil, at < 5 mm distance (i.e. rhizospheric soil), the mycorrhizal inoculation decreased the CARB (about 17.99%) and OXI-Zn (about 29.63%) forms compared to bulk soil (i.e. > 5 mm distance) while ORG-Zn was increased up to 48.63%. However, Ca(NO3)(2)-extractable, GARB and ORG-Pb was increased in rhizosphere soil (respectively, 89.33, 3.84 and 6.14%) and OXI-Pb was decreased up to 10.36% compared to the bulk soil. In the HH soil, mycorrhizal inoculation increased the GARB and OXI-Zn (respectively, 1.76 and 5.71%) and OXI-Pb fractions (11.56%) compared to the < 5 mm distances. Whereas, it reduced the Ca(NO3)(2)-extractable, EXCH, and ORG-Zn (Respectively, 52.70, 19.19 and 30.16%) and Ca(NO3)(2)-extractable, CARB and ORG-Pb (respectively, 47.18, 3.70 and 5.79%). These results revealed that depending on the soil contamination level and nature of the element, AMF colonization affects biogeochemical fractions of the metals and their accumulation in the plant tissues.

AB Triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) is an organophosphate flame retardant that is frequently detected in the environments. TPhP exposure is known to cause developmental toxicity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain underestimated. In the present study, zebrafish embryos were acutely exposed to 0, 4 and 100 mu g/L TPhP until 144 h post-fertilization. Profiles of differentially expressed proteins were constructed using a shotgun proteomic. With the input of differential proteins, principal component analysis suggested different protein expression profiles for 4 and 100 mu g/L TPhP. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses further found that effects of TPhP at 4 mu g/L targeted phagosome and lysosome activity, while 100 mu g/L TPhP mainly affected carbohydrate metabolism, muscular contraction and phagosome. Based on proteomic data, diverse bioassays were employed to ascertain the effects of TPhP on specific proteins and pathways. At gene and protein levels, expressions of critical visual proteins were significantly changed by TPhP exposure, including retinoschisin la, opsins and crystallins, implying the impairment of ocular development and function. TPhP exposure at 100 mu g/L also altered the abundances of diverse muscular proteins and disordered the assembly of muscle fibers. Effects of TPhP on visual development and motor activity may be combined to disturb larval swimming behavior. In summary, current results provided mechanistic clues to the developmental toxicities of TPhP. Future works are inspired to broaden the toxicological knowledge of TPhP based on current proteomic results.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are unintentionally generated in foods that are cooked, and dietary ingestion of these PAHs is regarded as the dominant route of exposure to PAHs. Some chlorinated PAHs (CIPAHs) are more toxic than their corresponding parent PAHs and can also be generated in food during cooking. Knowledge of the concentrations of ClPAHs in cooked foods has been limited by the lack of an adequate analytical method for measuring ClPAH concentrations in cooked foods. In this study, we developed an analytical method for simultaneous determination of PAHs and ClPAHs in lipid-rich foods. The combination of a potassium hydroxide silica gel column and an activated carbon cartridge enabled us to simultaneously measure PAH and CIPAH concentrations in raw and grilled fish and meats. Twelve kinds of PAHs (e.g., fluorene [Fle], phenanthrene [Phe], fluoranthene [Flu], and pyrene [Pyr]) were detected in grilled foods. The concentrations ranged from below the limit of quantitation (< LOQ) to 310 ng g(-1). We also detected 9-monochlorinated Phe (9-ClPhe), 3-monochlorinated Flu (3-ClFlu), 8-monochlorinated Flu (8-ClFlu), and 1-monochlorinated Pyr (1-ClPyr); those concentrations ranged from < LOQ to 0.16 ng g(-1). The total concentrations of PAHs were significantly lower in gas-grilled meats than in charcoal-grilled meats. In contrast, the concentrations of CIPAHs were significantly higher in gas-grilled meats than in the charcoal-grilled meats. This pattern could be attributed to the difference of reaction temperatures needed to generate them. Toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations, which were calculated based on toxicities relative to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), were much higher in the grilled foods (0.12-12 ngBaP(eq) g(-1)) for PAHs than for ClPAHs (< LOQ to 0.026 ng-BaPeq g(-1)).

AB Understanding the trophic movement and trophic magnification factor (TMF) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is an important criterion to assess their fate and potential effects in an aquatic ecosystem. This study investigated concentrations and trophodynamics of 16 priority PAHs in food web(wb) (food web comprising whole bodies) and food web(m) (food web containing only muscles) of total 14 species ((including plankton, shrimp, whitebait, mussels, snails, red-eared terrapin and seven other fish species) from the Dianshan Lake. Values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 were determined to assign trophic levels to organisms. In general, there was no evidence of biomagnification because of biological degradation of PAHs compounds, but only 9 PAH compounds in food web, showed a statistically significant negative relationship between trophic level and lipid normalized concentration compared to the 6 PAHs congeners in food web(wb). However, TMF values of PAHs in food web, ranged from 0.32 for pyrene to 0.68 for phenanthrene compared to TMF values of food web(wb), ranged from 0.34 for pyrene to 0.74 for fluorene. Because of two opposing scientific views for biomagnification and biodilution of PAHs in the food web, albeit based on a rather limited number of studies, our study investigated that there is parabolic behavior of most of the PAHs. Concentrations of PAHs in the red-eared terrapin (Trachemys scripta elegans) were biodiluted which showed that this species metabolises such compounds. There was no particular relationship between K-ow and TMFs of PAHs in the Dianshan Lake. Hepatobiliary system (such as gall bladder and liver) in the whole body considered to have higher bioaccumulation potential of organic compounds than extrahepatic tissue (muscles).

AB Thermophilic membrane biofilm reactor (TMBR) for elemental mercury (Hg-0) and NO removal in simulated flue gas was investigated at oxygen content of 6% and 60 degrees C. The performance, the microbial community structures, gene function and the mechanism for Hg-0 and NO removal in the TMBR were evaluated. TMBR achieved effective simultaneous Hg-0 and NO removal in 210 days of operation, Hg-0 and NO removal efficiency were up to 88.9% and 85.3%, respectively. Mercury induced thermophilic community had been formed significantly. Comamonas, Pseudomonas, Desulfomicrobiwn, Burkholderia and Halomonas were thermophilic mercury resistant bacteria. Brucella, Paracoccus, Tepidiphilus, Proteobacteria, Pseudomonas and Symbiobacterium were nitrifying/denitrifying genera, and had functional genes of mercury and nitrogen metabolism, as shown by 16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing. The biofilm in TMBR was characterized by XPS, HPLC. XPS and HPLC spectra indicate the formation of a mercuric species (Hg2+) from mercury oxidation. TMBR used oxygen as electron acceptor, NO and Hg-0 as electron donor in nitrification; O-2, NO and NO3- could be used as electron acceptor and Hg-0 as electron donor in denitrification.

AB In this study, the planarian Dugesia japonica was exposed to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and blueberry anthocyanins (ANT) for 1-10 days to investigate the protective effects of ANT on neurotoxicity and DNA damage induced by PFOS. The expression of neural related genes (Djnig, DjFoxD, DjFoxG, DjotxA, and DjotxB) in D. japonica following exposure was determined using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Immunofluorescence was performed to determine the alterations in neural morphology. In addition, ELISA kits were used to measure level of the neurotransmitters Dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, single cell gel electrophoresis was measured to analyze DNA damage. In this study, PFOS treatment induced neural morphology defects, alterations in neural-related gene expression, alterations in neurotransmitter levels, and DNA damage. However, co-exposure to ANT and PFOS mitigated the damage to D. japonica induced by PFOS. Restoration of neurotransmitter contents and neural related genes expression were observed in planarians following co-application of ANT and PFOS, immunofluorescence showed that nerve morphology almost recovered, and DNA damage was decreased. The results of this study showed that ANT may have a protective effect against PFOS induced neurotoxicity and DNA damage.

AB In the present study, we investigated the role of calcite, i.e., microbiologically-induced precipitate by ureolytic Trichoderma sp. MG, in remediation of soils contaminated with arsenic (As) and lead (Pb). The fungus tolerates high concentrations of As (500 mg/L) and Pb (650 mg/L). The effects of three factors, i.e., urea concentration, CaCl2 concentration and pH, on urease production and bio-mineralization of As and Pb were investigated using Box-Behnken design. The maximum urease production (920 U/mL) and metal removal efficiency (68% and 59% for Pb and AS, respectively) were observed in the medium containing urea of 300 mM and CaCl2 of 75 mM at pH 9.0. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy result revealed the formation of metal carbonates by the isolate MG. Sequential extraction of metals revealed that the carbonate fractions of As and Pb were increased to 46.4% and 42.4% in bioremediated soil, whereas in control they were 35.5% and 32.5%, respectively. The X-ray powder diffraction result further confirmed the role of calcite precipitate in bioremediation of As- and Pb-contaminated soils. The results points out that the microbiologically-induced calcite precipitation is a feasible, eco-friendly technology for the bioremediation of As- and Pb-contaminated sites.

AB Zeolite has traditionally been used to remediate wastewater and soil. The present study shows a new method for natural zeolite (NZ) modification with wood vinegar (WV). The optimal conditions for NZ modification with WV were determined, and the adsorption capacities towards lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As), antimicrobial activities against Escherichia colt, heavy metal(loid) fraction and characterizations of selected modified zeolites (MZs) were also investigated. The results indicate that 50-fold dilution of WV, 5 g of NZ dosage, 105 degrees C of drying temperature, 4h and 95 degrees C of water bath are preferred for NZ modification with WV. The WV + NaOH-MZ exhibited the best performance in heavy metal removal and the most powerful antimicrobial activity among all the zeolites. The sequence of WV + NaOH-MZ for the maximum single metal(loid) adsorption capacities was Pb (48.67 mg/g) > Cd (23.67 mg/g) > As (0.024 mg/g). The WV + NaOH and WV modifications also can increase the stabilities of heavy metals in the MZs. The residual fractions of single Pb and Cd in WV + NaOH-MZ and WV-MZ were 50%, 55%, 34% and 30%, respectively. The pore size of WV + NaOH-MZ (11.73 nm) was bigger than that of NZ or WV-MZ. Additionally, the proportion of clinoptilolite in WV + NaOH-MZ was also higher than other zeolites. The surfaces of WV + alkali-MZs were rougher than that of NZ. Considering the low cost and environmental risk of WV, this work provides some useful information for management of agricultural and industrial residues, environment and food safety.

AB Despite the increasing interest for biochar as a soil amendment, a knowledge gap remains on its impacts on non target soil and aquatic species. We hypothesised that biochar particle size and application rate can play a role in the toxicity to biota. Pine woodchip biochar was incorporated in a clean soil at three particle size classes: small (< 0.5 mm), medium (1-2 mm), and large (< 4 mm), and at two concentrations: 1% and 6% w/w. A laboratory screening with earthworm Eisenia andrei avoidance behaviour bioassay was carried out to test the most adequate application rates, particle sizes and soil-biochar pre-incubation period. Thereafter, a 28-day greenhouse microcosm experiment was conducted as an ecologically more representative approach. Survival, vertical distribution and weight changes of E. andrei, and bait-lamina consumption were recorded. Soil leachates from the microcosms were collected to evaluate their impact on Daphnia magna immobilisation and Vibrio fischeri (Microtox) bioluminescence. A feeding experiment with E. andrei was also performed to address earthworm weight changes and to conduct a screening of PAH-type metabolites in their tissue. The 6% < 0.5 mm treatment pre-incubated for 96 h induced significant avoidance of the earthworms. Significantly lower bait-lamina consumption was observed in microcosms for the 6% < 0.5 mm treatment. Moreover, particle size was a statistically significant factor regarding the loss of weight in the feeding experiment and higher concentration of naphthalene-type metabolites detected in E. andrei tissue, when exposed to < 0.5 mm biochar particles. The leachates had no adverse effects on the aquatic species. The results suggest that particles < 0.5 mm of pine woodchip biochar can pose sub-lethal effects on soil biota.

AB Chemical contaminants are known to accumulate in marine megafauna globally, but little is known about how this impacts animal health. In vitro assays offer an ethical, reproducible and cost-effective alternative to live animal toxicity testing on large, long-lived or threatened species, such as sea turtles. However, using a cell culture from a single animal raise the question of whether the toxicity observed adequately represents the toxicity in that species. This study examined variation in the cytotoxic response of primary skin fibroblasts established from seven green (Chelonia mydas) and five loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtles. Cell viability using resazurin dye was examined in response to exposure to five contaminants. The variation in cytotoxicity was generally low (within a factor of five) for both independent analyses of the same cell culture, and cell cultures from different individuals. This low within and between cell culture variation indicates that primary sea turtle cell cultures can provide a suitable approach to understanding toxicity in sea turtles. In addition, green and loggerhead turtle cells showed similar toxicity to the compounds tested, indicating that only subtle differences in chemical sensitivity may exist between sea turtle species. This study provides a framework for using species specific cell cultures in future toxicological studies on sea turtles. Although in vivo studies are the gold standard for toxicological studies and species-specific risk assessments, the development of in vitro tools can provide important information when in vivo studies are not possible or practical. For large, endangered species such as sea turtles that are exposed to, and accumulate, a large number of contaminants, using validated cell cultures may facilitate the rapid assessment of chemical risk to these animals.

AB The enrichment of Cadmium in vegetables is threatening human health. The study aimed to screen Cd low enriched leafy vegetables and explore whether antioxidative enzymes and heavy metal chelators are synergistic defensive mechanisms. In this paper, the Cd accumulation and translocation of garland chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum coronarium L.), spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) were examined by soil pot culture and hydroponic experiments. The responses of oxidative stress markers, antioxidative enzymes activity, and thiol pool (cysteine, gamma-glutamylcysteine, glutathione, and phytochelatins) content to Cd stress were assayed. The results showed that Garland chrysanthemum was Cd low-uptake species. The soil Cd safety thresholds for spinach, lettuce, and garland chrysanthemum were 0.41, 0.49, and 9.10 mg kg(-1), respectively. The order of root phytochelatins (PCs) concentration was consistent with that of plant tolerance index (TI): garland chrysanthemum > spinach > lettuce. While the order of the ratio of shoot Cd to root Cd (SR ratio) was exactly the opposite of that of TI. In lettuce root, activity of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase decreased significantly under Cd stress. Nevertheless those parameters in the roots of spinach and lettuce maintained steady, or even enhanced. In conclusion, the Cd translocation and partition in plant, antioxidative defense, and PCs homeostasis played an important role in the Cd tolerance of vegetables.

AB Cross-sectional studies have described an association between exposure to phthalate esters and cardiovascular risk factors. However, the association with coronary heart disease (CHD) is still unclear. A total of 180 subjects randomly selected from 336 CHD patients, and 360 age- and sex-matched non-CHD controls were included from 2008 to 2011. Urinary metabolites of phthalate esters were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The geometric means of urinary phthalates metabolites were significantly higher for the three Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) metabolites, mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate, and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate among CHD patients in-hospital than those of being discharged. Excluding 89 CHD patients of in-hospital and hospital discharge within 2 days, we found the urinary concentrations of MEHP, mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), and mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) of 91 CHD patients discharged >= 3 days were higher than those of controls. Among 451 participants, those with higher tertile levels of urinary MEHP, MnBP, and MiBP showed an increased risk for CHD compared to those with lowest tertile levels; the corresponding odds ratios (95% CI) were 2.77 (1.22-6.28), 2.90 (1.32-6.4), and 3.19 (1.41-7.21), respectively, after adjustment for confounders. Higher levels of hs-CRP, fibrinogen, and D-dimer were linked with increased levels of all DEHP metabolites in CHD patients. In conclusion, exposure to DEHP and dibutyl phthalates was positively associated with CHD and this relationship may be probably mediated via atherothrombosis.

AB Ionizable strategies are routinely used to enhance the solubility and dissolution rates of various pharmaceuticals. These chemicals may directly affect aquatic environment once discharged from factories, hospitals or livestock farms. Here, we assessed the potential side effect of tetracyclines (TCs) on the development of zebrafish embryos. Tetracycline hydrochloride decreased water pH from 6.4 to 4.4 at 30 mg/L. Acidified water exceeded the tolerance of zebrafish embryos in pure water during the early ten hours post fertilization (hpf). Interestingly, we found that Ca2+ in the embryo medium could increase the tolerance of embryos to acidified water. Furthermore, we found that the protection of Ca2+ was not due to the formation of TCs-Ca2+ complexes under acidic condition, based on spectral analysis. Meanwhile we showed that exogenous addition of Ca2+ could inhibit the accumulation of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm to the surface of embryos. These results may shed light on the strategies for protecting aquatic animals from acidic environments.

AB Due to the extensive use in consumer products, the bisphenols (BPs) pollution in the environments has aggravated and people are frequently exposed to BPs. In this research, four BPs, i.e., bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol AF (BPAF), were determined in urine samples collected from Gaochun District preschool-age children and the concentrations, distribution profiles, potential sources and cumulative risk assessment of the target compounds were studied. Total concentrations of 4 BPs ranged from 2 to 3113.1 ng/L, with the average concentration of 648.6 ng/L. BPA was the predominant congener (accounting for 94%), followed by BPS. Correlation analysis indicated a negative relationship between BPA and BPAF (R = -0.273, p < 0.05). The estimated daily intakes suggested that young females were more sensitive to BPs. Moreover, the cumulative risk for hazard quotient (HQ) of BPA has been evaluated and the results showed that no high risk had occurred. It provided basic information on the occurrence and human exposure to urinary BPs of preschool aged children from Gaochun District.

AB The final fate of many drugs is release into the natural aquatic environment. It is necessary to assess the toxicity caused by this situation and the associated concerns for human beings. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a common biomodel used to assess toxicity in aquatic environments. The zebrafish embryo toxicity test was selected to evaluate the acute toxicity of several drugs (diphenhydramine, gentamicin, tobramycin, enalapril and lidocaine) due to the lack of such information. Lethal and sublethal effects were detected, and the LC50 values of the drugs ranged from 11.0 mg/L to 422.10(2) mg/L. For all of the drugs tested, these values were higher than the concentrations found in the natural environment. Therefore, there was a low environmental toxicological risk. Nevertheless, teratogenic effects were also recorded when embryos of zebrafish were exposed to caffeine (control drug), diphenhydramine and lidocaine at lower concentrations than the respective LC50 values. Quantitative structure activity relationship analysis was also performed to analyse these drugs and other chemicals with pharmaceutical uses as well as previous toxicological data in this vertebrate after 48 h of exposure. It is estimated that the partition coefficient, log P, is the main physicochemical property related to the ecotoxicological data and can be used for the development of a mathematical model.

AB Cistus monspeliensis L. is a species that grows spontaneously in contaminated mining areas of the Iberian Pyrite Belt. This species can accumulate high concentrations of As in the shoots without visible signs of phytotoxicity. In order to understand the physiological mechanisms underlying this tolerance, C. monspeliensis was grown in an Arenosol irrigated with aqueous nutrient solutions containing increasing concentrations of As (0, 1500, 5000, 10000, 15000 mu M) and the effects of this metalloid on plant development and on the defence mechanisms against oxidative stress were monitored. Independently of the treatment, As was mainly retained in the roots. The plants with the highest concentrations of As in the shoots (> 5000 mu M) showed toxicity symptoms such as chlorosis, low leaf size and decrease in biomass production and also nutritional deficiencies. Most of the studied physiological parameters (pigments, glutathione, ascorbate and antioxidative enzymes) showed significant correlation with As concentration in roots and shoots. Pigments, especially anthocyanins, were negatively affected even in the treatments with the lowest As concentrations. Glutathione increased significantly in roots at low As levels while in shoots this increase occurred in all As treatments. Ascorbate decreased in both tissues with As addition. The highest concentrations of As in shoots of C. monspeliensis triggered defence mechanisms against oxidative stress, namely by inducing the expression of genes coding antioxidative enzymes.

AB Drought is one of the major abiotic stresses which negatively affect plant growth and crop yield. Metallothionein (MTs) is a low molecular weight protein, mainly involved in metal homeostasis, while, its role in drought stress is still to be largely explored. The present study was aimed to investigate the role of MT gene against drought stress. The chickpea MT based on its up-regulation under drought stress was overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana to explore its role in mitigation of drought stress. The total transcript of MT gene was up to 30 fold higher in transgenic lines. Arabidopsis plants transformed with MT gene showed longer roots, better efficiency of survival and germination, larger siliques and higher biomass compared to WT. The physiological variables (A, WUE, G, E, qP and ETR) of WT plants were reduced during drought stress which recovered in transgenic Arabidopsis lines. The enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant (APX, GPX, POD, GR, GRX, GST, CAT, MDHAR, ASc and GSH) levels were also enhanced in transgenic lines to provide tolerance. Simultaneously, drought responsive amino acids, i.e. proline and cysteine contents were higher in transgenic lines. Overall, the results suggest that MT gene is actively involved in the mitigation of drought stress and could be the choice for genetic engineering strategy to overcome drought stress.

AB Norgestrel (NGT) is a synthetic progestin used in human and veterinary medicine. Adult female mosquitofish were exposed to NGT for 42 d at 377 ng L-1. The fin morphology and the liver transcriptome were assessed. NGT exposure increased ray 4:6 length ratio. As compared to the control, NGT treatment affected the expression of 11,772 annotated transcripts in female mosquitofish. Specifically, we found 5780 were repressed while 5992 were significantly induced. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that 53 KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways and 158 GO terms were significantly over expressed. Genes showing the largest magnitude of expression changes were related to fin development, androgen biosynthesis, and lipid and fatty acid metabolisms, suggesting the involvement of these biological processes in response to NGT exposure in G. affinis. This first comprehensive study on the transcriptomic alterations by NGT in G. affinis not only provides valuable information on the development of molecular markers but also opens new avenues for studies on the molecular mechanisms of effects of NGT in particular and possibly other progestins in G. affinis.

AB Zinc as a micronutrient and cadmium as a nonessential toxic element share similar pathways for entering plant tissues and thus may be antagonistic. In nutrient solution culture, 17-day-old radish (Raphanus sativus L) plants were exposed to short-term (24 h) equimolar metal contamination (2.2 mu M of each Zn-70 and total Cd) to investigate the in situ Zn/Cd distribution in the apical root tissues using high-resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging. Inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis of bulk root tissue confirmed large root uptake of both metal elements. After 24-h exposure the total root concentration (in mu g/g DW) of Zn-70 was 180 +/- 24 (mean +/- SE) and of total Cd 352 +/- 11. NanoSIMS mapping was performed on the cross sections of the radish root apex as a crucial component in root growth and uptake of water and nutrients from soil. Elemental maps of Zn-70 and Cd-114 isotopes revealed greater enrichment of both metals in the outer epidermal root layer than in cortical tissues and especially stele, confirming the epidermal root cells as preferential sites of metal uptake, and indicating relatively slow and less-intensive metal transport into other parts (edible hypocotyl, shoot) of metal-sensitive radish. NanoSIMS has been confirmed as a powerful tool for spatial detection and visualisation of some ultra-trace metal isotopes (e.g. Zn-70) in the fast-growing root tips. However, precise (sub)cellular mapping of diffusible metallic ions (Cd, Zn) remains a technically-challenging task in plant specimens given an unavoidable compromise between optimising methodology for structural preservation vs. authentic in vivo ion localisation.

AB A biotin-streptavidin-amplified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a biotinylated nanobody (BA-Nb ELISA) was developed to detect ochratoxin A (OTA) in cereal. The limit of detection (LOD) of the BA-Nb ELISA, which equals to 10% maximal inhibitory concentration, was 0.011 ng/mL for OTA in buffer, and the sensitivity was approximately improved by one order of magnitude compared with the traditional Nb ELISA (LOD = 0.112 ng/mL). Under optimal conditions, the developed assay could be accomplished in 40 min with maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.138 ng/mL and the linear detection range of 0.034-0.460 ng/mL. The average recovery rate of the BA-Nb ELISA ranged from 92.8% to 114%, and the relative standard deviation was in the range of 2.04-9.85%. The developed BA-Nb ELISA was validated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the results indicated the reliability of BA-Nb ELISA for the detection of OTA in cereal.

AB Roxarsone (ROX), an organoarsenic feed additive, occurs as itself and its metabolites including As(V), As(III), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in animal manure. Animal manure improves soil biological property, whereas As compounds impact microorganisms. The integral influence of animal manure bearing ROX metabolites on soil biological quality is not clear yet. Herein, the effect of four chicken manures excreted by chickens fed with four diets containing 0, 40, 80 and 120 mg ROX kg(-1), on soil biological attributes. ROX addition in chicken diets increased total As and ROX metabolites in manures, but decreased manure total N, ammonium and nitrate. The elevated ROX metabolites in manures increased soil total As, As species and total N, and increased first and then decreased soil nitrate and nitrite, but did not affect soil ammonium in manure-applied soils. The promoting role of both soil As(III) and ammonium on soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, respiration and saccharase activity, were exceeded or balanced by the inhibiting effect of soil nitrate. The suppression of soil catalase activity by soil As(V) was surpassed by the enhancement caused by soil nitrate and nitrite. Soil urease, acid phosphatase and polyphenol oxidase activities were not suitable bioindicators in the four manure-amended soils. Soil DMA did not affect soil biological properties, and MMA was not detectable in all manure-amended soils. The above highlights the complexity of joint influence of soil As and N on biological attributes. Totally, when ROX is used at allowable dose in chicken diet, soil biological quality would be suppressed in manure-amended soil.

AB Ozone layer depletion leads to elevated ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation, which affects plant growth; however, little is known about the relationship between root growth and signaling molecules in roots. Therefore, in this work, simulated UV-B radiation was used to study the effects of elevated UV-B radiation on root growth of soybean seedlings and changes in the content of signaling molecules in roots. The results showed that compared with the control, the 2.63 kJ m(-2) d(-1) and 6.17 kJ m(-2) d(-1) elevated UV-B radiation treatments inhibited root growth, and root growth parameters (total root length, root surface area, root volume, average diameter, root tip number, and root dry weight) all decreased. For root signaling molecules, the content of nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid increased, and the content of auxin, cytokinin, and gibberellin decreased. The above indices changed more significantly under the 6.17 kJ m(-2) d(-1) treatment. After withdrawal of the exposure, the above indices could be restored to a certain extent. These data indicated that UV-B radiation interfered with root growth by affecting the content of signaling molecules in roots, and the degree of the effects was related to the intensity of UV-B radiation. The results from this study provide a theoretical basis for studying the preliminary mechanism of elevated UV-B radiation on root growth and possible pathways that can mitigate UV-B radiation damage for root growth.
   One sentence summary: The effects of elevated UV-B on root growth of soybean seedlings were regulated by signaling molecules, and the degree of the effects was related to the intensity of UV-B radiation.

AB The fungicide vinclozolin (Vz) is an endocrine disruptor with known anti-androgenic activity in vertebrates. However, there is a lack of information about the Vz mode of action in invertebrates, although some studies have shown that this compound can produce alterations in different species. Transcriptional activity was analyzed in the freshwater snail Physella acuta in order to elucidate putative cellular processes altered by this chemical during a response. In order to identify potential molecular biomarkers, a de novo transcriptome was generated for this species that constitutes a valuable source for future studies. This data, together with some already available data, permitted the identification of several genes related to detoxification mechanisms (Cyp2u1, Cyp3a7, Cyp4f22, GSTo1, GSTt2, and MRP1), stress response (Hsp20.4, Hsp17, Hsp16.6, and Cu,Zn-SOD), the hormonal system (Estrogen Receptor and Hsp90), apoptosis (Casp3), and copper homeostasis (ATOX1). Using quantitative Real-Time polymerase chain reaction, mRNA levels of these genes were examined in snails exposed to 20 or 200 mu g/L Vz for 24 h. The results showed an overall weak response, with downregulation of Hsp20.4 and no statistically significant change for the other genes. These findings suggest that P. acuta can manage the concentrations of Vz found in the environment with no relevant activation of the pathways analyzed, although additional studies are needed for longer exposure times and including other metabolic pathways. The new genes described open the range of processes that can be studied at the molecular level in toxicity tests.

AB Combination of biotic and abiotic factors influences the effects of naturally occurring or anthropogenic chemicals on photosynthetic microorganisms in the aquatic environment. Nonetheless, the combined effects of physical stressors and species-species interaction on chemicals toxicity are still poorly understood. The present study examines the responses of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. alone and in mixtures to copper exposure under increasing visible light intensities. Cell growth, chlorophyll bleaching, oxidative stress and membrane permeability were determined by flow cytometry in both mono- and multi-species tests. The results revealed that species-species interactions influenced copper toxicity under different light regimes at 4 h and 48 h - exposure. For a given light condition, monocultures of Synechocystis sp. were more sensitive to copper than those of C. reinhardtii. In long-term incubation C. reinhardtii sensitivity to copper diminished in presence of Synechocystis sp. under low-intensity light, however it was enhanced under high-intensity light. The present results revealed the complex interplay between visible light intensity variations, species-species interaction and copper effects to phytoplankton in long- term exposure.

AB The ability to analyze biotoxicity of atmospheric pollution plays an important role in public health. It provides the potential to directly analyze the health information of at-risk individuals. Although air quality standards have received significant attention in many countries, the potential for better biotoxicity assessment has remained largely unexplored. Here we propose a method using one kind of luminescent bacterium Photobacterium phosphereum to detect the biotoxicity of atmospheric particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). Combined with the results of air pollution data of the year 2013-2014, this method has been proven to have good biotoxicity detection performance, and can evaluate the severity of at least 85% of PM2.5 related biotoxicity in Shanghai during this time period. Based on an established algorithm of this detection system, the biotoxicity of twelve PM2.5 real samples (collected over a month) were tested and divided into different biotoxicity levels. It allows an effective evaluation of biotoxicity of PM2.5 due to the quick and sensitive response of bioluminescence to the concentration of toxic components, which provides a valuable reference to evaluate the biotoxicity of PM2.5. This established method can be easily applied to the analysis and evaluation of any other PM2.5 samples assay by following the steps.

AB Gaseous elemental Hg is stable enough to be transported over long distances. Some of the most important sources of Hg in the atmosphere are artisanal gold mining activities and forest fires. Both of these sources are particularly prevalent in the Amazonia region. Information regarding the capacity of soils for retaining Hg transported by the atmosphere is very important for understanding the metal cycle in the environment. The aim of this work was to study gaseous elemental Hg adsorption in soils with different physical and chemical characteristics. For this purpose, soils from different regions in Brazil and Colombia influenced or possibly influenced by gold mining activities and forest fires were studied. Hg adsorption tests were conducted by exposing soil samples to a gaseous elemental Hg atmosphere for 144 h. The total Hg concentration (THg) and Hg oxidation states were monitored using a direct Hg analyzer. Sample characterization analyses were performed. THg values obtained before the adsorption tests were 43-413 and 144-590 mu g kg(-1) for grain size fractions below 2 and 0.063 mm, respectively. The predominant species found was Hg2+, with abundance levels from 68% to 99%. The results show a wide range of enhanced Hg retention capacities among the samples, ranging from 13 to 2236 times the initial concentration, and the speciation results demonstrate a decrease in the oxidized species range, from 21% to 78%. The statistical analysis indicated the importance of Mn-bearing minerals for the processes of adsorption/oxidation of gaseous elemental Hg in soils. These results contribute to the elucidation of the processes that occur with Hg at the soil/atmosphere interface and may help to explain the high concentrations of Hg found in Amazonian soils where no gold mining activities are practiced.

AB Reproductive epidemiological studies have suggested associations between perinatal exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and adverse birth outcomes. To explore the effects of early prenatal exposure to PM2.5 on subsequent generations, pregnant mice were exposed to PM2.5 or filtered clean air in whole body dynamic exposure chambers for 14 consecutive days from gestation day (GD) 1.5 to GD15.5. Neurobehavioral tests showed that spontaneous locomotion and exploratory behaviors in the offspring were significantly enhanced in the open field test. Meanwhile, metabolomics analysis suggested activation of dopamine pathway while inhibition of glycine pathway in murine brains. Administration of the DRD4 antagonist, clozapine; or supplementation of glycine receptor agonist, taurine, to mice offspring attenuated the locomotor hyperactivities to levels indistinguishable from controls. These data provide strong evidence that maternal exposure to air pollution might increase the risk for neural disorders in the offspring during critical periods of brain development.

AB A 90 day experiment was conducted in the laboratory to investigate the potential effects of transgenic Cry1Ab-expressing rice (Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) rice: T775 and its Fl hybrid) straw return on earthworm Eisenia fetida, compared to non-Bt rice (TYHZ) straw. Juvenile E. fetida could survive, grow up, mature and reproduce offspring well in a Bt rice treated test during the whole experiment. The significantly higher relative growth rate (RGR) was found in earthworms from Bt rice treatment than from non-Bt rice treatment on the 7th day. The period of sexual maturity for earthworms from Bt rice treatments was shortened significantly, compared to non-Bt rice treatments. Adult E. fetida survived with weight loss under Bt rice treatments. On the 7th and 15th day, earthworm RGR decreased and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity increased under Bt rice straw treatments. Significantly fewer offspring were produced by earthworms from Bt rice than non-Bt rice treatments on the 60th and 75th day. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) determined a sharp decrease of Cry1Ab in straw mixed soil along with the experimental time, regardless of juvenile or adult earthworm treatments. Cry1Ab concentration in the earthworms from the juvenile group was significantly higher than those from the adult group. Bt rice straw return had significant effects on soil nutrients, especially on the content of total and available phosphorus. In view of two bioassays, Bt rice (T775 and its F1 hybrid) straw return presented different effects on E. fetida from the juvenile (no deleterious effect) and adult (a little negative effect) groups, that were not directly related to Cry1Ab presence and nutrient differences among the three rice variety treatments.

AB Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that have neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, hepatotoxicity and immunotoxicity in both animals and humans. Few studies have focused on the changes to endogenous glycerophospholipid metabolism caused by PCB153. To evaluate the relationships between exposure to PCB153 and specific endogenous glycerophospholipid metabolism, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was implemented in this study. Twenty-two endogenous glycerophospholipids in PC12 cells were analyzed after exposure to PCB153 at dosages of 0.05 mu g mL(-1), 0.5 mu g(-1) or 20 mu g mL(-1) for 120 h. PC(14:0/14:0), PE(16:0/18:1), PE(16:0/18:2), PS(18:0/ 18:1) and PI(16:0/18:1) were identified as potential biomarkers under the rules of t-test (P) value < 0.05 and variable importance at projection (VIP) value > 1. It was also found that the alterations at 0.05 mu g(-1) and 20 mu g mL(-1) PCB153 were similar at 120 h, while 0.5 mu g mL(-1) PCB153 presented an opposite trend. Additionally, significant upregulation of PC, PE and PS with the same fatty acid chains of 18:0/18:2 was found after exposure to 0.05 mu g mL(-1) and 20 mu g ml(-1) PCB153 at 120 h. This study revealed that PCB153 exposure modulated 22 endogenous glycerophospholipids in PC12 cells and provided the basis for the further study of PCB153 on the effects of glycerophospholipids on PC12 cells.

AB In recent years, biochar is being widely considered as an effective and low cost biosorbent in water and wastewater treatment processes. Various biomasses can be effectively used for biochar production, and this study investigates the use of a novel biochar derived from pistachio green hull to remove Cu(II) from aqueous solutions. The biochar was analyzed by FTIR, SEM-WDX, and SEM-EDX. The efficacy of several experimental factors was investigated in a number of batch adsorption experiments. The sorption kinetics of copper on the biochar were satisfactorily described by a pseudo-second order model. The adsorption isotherms were well described by the Langmuir model. The analysis of experimental results suggested that the Cu(II) sorption onto biochar could mainly be ascribed to cation exchange, surface precipitation, and surface complexation with oxygen-containing functional groups. Overall, it can be concluded that biochar derived from pistachio green hull is valuable as a green cost-effective sorbent for Cu(II) removal from water.

AB Cerium oxide (CeO2) is extensively used in a range of applications like in television tubes, glass/ceramic polishing agent, fuel cells, solar cells, gas sensor andultraviolet absorbents. In current study, Allium ana-telophase and comet assays were employed to evaluate the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of CeO2 microparticles (CMPs, < 5 mu m, bulk) and CeO2 nanoparticles (CNPs, < 25 nm) on the root meristem cells of Allium cepa by using mitotic phases, mitotic index (MI), chromosomal aberrations (CAs), and DNA damage. A cepa roots were treated with the CMPs and CNPs at four different concentrations (12.5, 25, 50, and 100 ppm) for 4 h. Methyl methane sulphonate (MMS,10 ppm) and distilled water were used as positive and negative control groups, respectively. All the applied doses statistically decreased MIs. MI values of CMPs were found higher than CNPs. CMPs and CNPs significantly increased CAS such as chromosome laggards, disturbed anaphase-telophase, stickiness and bridges and also DNA damage. Characterization of CMPs and CNPs showed the particle size as 4.24 +/- 0.7 mu m and 20.28 +/- 2.33 nm, respectively. The average diameter of CMPs and CNPs in solution were in the range of 372.75 +/- 70.23 nm and 167.74 +/- 38.7 nm, respectively. These results demonstrated that CMPs and CNPs had cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in A. cepa root meristematic cells.

AB Water fluoridation is the most widespread measure to prevent dental caries but its relationship with the development of type-1 diabetes (T1D), which has been increasing by 2-5% worldwide, is not quite well understood.
   Aim: This study evaluated if fluoride (F) administered in the drinking water can prevent or reduce the development of T1D in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, as well as to explore the underlying mechanisms.
   Materials and methods: Twenty-four weaning NOD mice received water containing 0,10 or 50 ppm F for 21 days. Plasma glucose and insulin were analyzed. Quantitative proteomic analysis was conducted in the liver and gastrocnemius muscle.
   Results: Animals treated with 10 ppm F had significantly lower glucose levels than the control group, but there was no significant difference among the groups in relation to insulin. The % of beta-cell function was significantly higher in the 10 ppm F group. Changes in the proteomic profile of muscle and liver were seen among the groups. In the muscle, the 10 ppm F group presented, when compared with control, increased expression of proteins involved in energy metabolism. The 50 ppm F group, compared with control, presented increased expression of proteins related to muscle contraction, differentiation of brown adipose tissue and apoptosis. For the liver, the 10 ppm F group had increase in proteins involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis, in respect to control. There was also an increase in isoforms of Glutathione S transferase, which was confirmed by Western blotting. In the group treated with 50 ppm F, proteins related to ROS metabolism and energetic metabolism were altered.
   Conclusion: Increased expression of antioxidant proteins by treatment with low F concentration may possibly help to explain protection against the development of T1D, which should be better explored in future mechanistic studies.

AB The bioaccumulation, cell, tissue distribution, and biological effects of 5 nm glutathione-capped CdS quantum dots (CdS QDs) in mussels was compared to bulk and aqueous Cd forms through a two-tier experimental approach. In the 1st tier, mussels were exposed for 3 d to 0.05, 0.5 and 5 mg Cd/l (QDs, bulk, aqueous), bioaccumulation, distribution and lysosomal responses were investigated. In the 2nd tier, mussels were exposed for 21 d to the same forms at the lowest effective concentration selected after Tier 1 (0.05 mg Cd/l), biomarkers and toxicopathic effects were investigated. Accumulation was comparable in QDs and aqueous Cd exposed mussels after 3 d. After 21 d, QDs exposed mussels accumulated less than mussels exposed to aqueous Cd and localised in the endo-lysosomal system and released to the alveoli lumen (21 d) after exposure to QDs and aqueous Cd. Intracellular levels of Cd increased on exposure to QDs and aqueous Cd, and to a lesser extent to bulk, and accompanied by the up-regulation of metallothionein 10 (1 d) and 20 (1, 21 d). Lysosomal membrane destabilisation depended on Cd2+ released by all forms but was marked after exposure to aqueous Cd (1 d). Toxicopathic effects (vacuolisation, loss of digestive cells and haemocytic infiltration) were evident after exposure to QDs (1 d) and aqueous Cd (21 d). Toxicity most likely depended on the ionic load resulting from Cd2+ release from the different forms of Cd; yet nanoparticle-specific effects of QDs cannot be disregarded.

AB Different distributions of 28 elements and 17 amino acids in pectoralis, wing biceps brachii and leg gastrocnemius of chicken upon CuSO4 (300 mg/kg) exposure for 90 days were investigated. Accompanied by copper accumulation, pathological injuries were observed in those three kinds of skeletal muscles using histological and ultrastructural methods. Based on data obtained, we analyzed leg gastrocnemius displayed the most increases (P < 0.000) in all three kinds of elements detected, including macroelements (131%), essential microelements (129%) and toxic microelements (179%) than the other two skeletal muscles. Furthermore, decreased total amino acids (P = 0.006), a susceptibility of lipid peroxidation/oxidative stress and a disequilibrium of nutrition and taste were analyzed in the leg gastrocnemius, indicating an unsuitability for human consumption. Intriguingly, these anomalies were scarce in pectoralis and wing biceps brachii. Combined with multivariate analysis we may conclude that leg gastrocnemius are more vulnerable to copper stress than pectoralis and wing biceps brachii in chicken.

AB The water environment from river to reservoir has been considered as a hybrid river-reservoir system due to pronounced environmental properties. This study investigated the distribution and potential environmental behavior of pesticides in river-reservoir system, examining 31 target pesticides in water phase from a key drinking water source (Dongjiang River). The concentrations of Sigma(8)OCPs, Sigma(16)OPPs and Sigma(7)SPs with the corresponding occurrence were in the range of 107.57-340.35 ng/L (moderate level), 232.65-1197.95 ng/L (moderate level) and 125.23-245.09 ng/L (low level), respectively. Ecological risk assessments indicated that most of the pesticides posed a high level of risk to the aquatic organisms. Moreover, seasonal agricultural application, rainfall and temperature could influence the levels and compositions of Sigma(8)OCPs, Sigma(16)OPPs and Sigma(7)SPs in the river system, while seasonal hydrological processes could only influence their compositions in the reservoir system. In the wet season, the levels of Sigma(8)OCPs and Sigma(7)SPs decreased from the river system to reservoir system probably via biogeochemical processes, while the level of Sigma(16)OPPs decreased along the environmental gradient probably via dilution process. Additionally, longer hydraulic retention time of the reservoir system could contribute to the biogeochemical processes for OPPs and SPs exported from the river system, but it might fail to facilitate this process for OCPs. Taken together, this study highlighted that the distributions and environmental behavior of pesticides in river-reservoir system varied seasonally from river system to reservoir system.

AB Textile dyeing wastewater was the focus of much research because of its adverse effect on aquatic biota. In the present research, textile dyeing influent and effluent samples were collected from four textile dyeing wastewater treatment plants (TDPs) in Guangdong province, China, and their conventional indicators and toxicity were examined to reveal relationships. The relationship between toxicity and chemical oxygen demand (COD) was clearly established at individual TDPs. Results indicated the highest removal efficiencies of 94.4%, 90.6%, 91.9%, 94.6%, 92.8% and 97.5% for TOC, mixed-liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS), COD, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total phosphorus (TP) and colour, respectively. The primary clarifier used in TDP3 and TDP4 was beneficial for removing macromolecular organic substances, and membrane filtration and sedimentation basin employed at TDP1 and TDP2, respectively, helped to remove toxic substances. Toxicity to V. fischeri or D. subspicatus was found to be related to certain conventional indicators such as TOC, COD, TP, colour, and MLVSS, and was positively correlated with COD in different textile dyeing effluents (R-2 > 0.84). It was recommended that the relationship between toxicity and COD in wastewater should be established individually at each plant. Therefore, this study could be useful in providing suggestions for guiding effluent management when no toxicity experiments were conducted.

AB The Wuda coal fire area in Inner Mongolia, China, has existed for 50 years and been controlled by digging and backfilling for many years. However, few studies have focused on its impact on the local environmental and ecological systems due to emission of organic contaminants from the backfilled region. In the study, topsoil samples were collected at a 0-5 cm depth from the backfilled region of the Wuda coal fire area, which has existed for five years. The samples were analyzed for 16 priority control contaminants, namely polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), with a standard operation procedure and high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). The results showed that the total mass contentration of 16 PAHs (Sigma(16)PAHs) ranged from 279 to 8258 mu g kg(-1), with an average value of 2853 +/- 2948 g kg(-1), which exceeded the stipulated limit for heavily contaminated soil (1000 mu g kg(-1)). Among the 16 PAHs, 2- and 3-ring compounds accounted for more than half of Sigma(16)PAHs. Furthermore, the results show that the main contaminants were the naphthalene (Nap), phenanthrene (Phe), pyrene (Pyr), chrysene (Chr), and benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF) in this area (24.8%, 51.1%, 3.9%, 4.5%, and 5.7% of Sigma(16)PAHs, respectively). The diagnostic ratio of FLA/(FLA + PYR) exceeded 0.4 and IcdP/(IcdP + BghiP) was less than 0.5, indicating gentle smoldering or spontaneous combustion of coal fire, which differs from traditional coal burning. The environmental health risk or specifically the cancer risk (CR), calculated using the surface soil of the backfilled region, was 2.84 x 10(-6) for adults and 1.01 x 10(-6) for children, thus indicating potential cancer risks. Therefore, PAHs pollution in the surface soil of the backfilled region in the studied coal fire area is an issue that deserves urgent attention.

AB The aim of the present study was to evaluate investigate the effects of beta-glucan on oxidative stress, inflammation and copper transport in two intestinal regions of large yellow croaker under acute copper stress. Fish were injected with beta-glucan at a dose of 0 or 5 mg kg(-1) body weight on 6, 4 and 2 days before exposed to 0 and 368 fig Cu L-1 for 48 h. Biochemical indicators (MDA, Cu content, MTs protein levels, Cu/Zn-SOD, CAT and iNOS activities), gene expressions of oxidative stresses (Cu/Zn-SOD, CAT, Nrf2, MTs and MTF-1), inflammatory responses (NF-kappa B, iNOS, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) and Cu transporters (ATP7A, ATP7B and CTR1) were determined. In the anterior intestine, beta-glucan increased MTs levels, activities of Cu/Zn-SOD, CAT and iNOS, mRNA levels of MTs, CAT, iNOS, ATP7A and ATP7B, and reduced Cu content and CTR1 gene expression to inhibite Cu-induced MDA. But beta-glucan had no effect on inflammatory gene expressions. In the mid intestine, beta-glucan increased activities of Cu/Zn-SOD and iNOS, mRNA levels of Cu/Zn-SOD, CAT and iNOS to maintain MDA content. However, unlike the anterior intestine, beta-glucan had no effect on Cu transporter gene expressions. Furthermore, transcription factors (Nrf2, NF-kappa B and MTF-1) paralleled with their target genes in the mid intestine, but no correlation was observed between NF-kappa B and IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha gene expressions in the anterior intestine. In conclusion, our results unambiguously showed that beta-glucan induced oxidative stress, inflammation and copper transport were varied between the anterior and mid intestines of fish under Cu stress.

AB Selenium (Se) is essential to humans and animals due to its antioxidant properties. Although it is not considered an essential nutrient for higher plants. Many studies show that Se in low concentrations (up to 0.5 mg kg(-1)) provides beneficial effects to non-hyperaccumulating plants by participating in antioxidant defense systems and enhancing tolerance to abiotic stress. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of Se application rates on rice plants under different soil water conditions. The experiment was conducted on an Oxisol using four Se rates (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg kg(-1)) and two soil water conditions (irrigated and water deficit). Selenium application via soil up to 0.5 mg kg(-1) increased the plant height, chlorophyll index, sulfur and copper accumulation in shoots, carbon dioxide assimilation, superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) activity and decreased the hydrogen peroxide concentration in rice leaves. The accumulation of Se in shoot biomass and Se concentration in seeds increased linearly with the applied rates. Water deficit strongly decreased the plant growth and yield. However, rice plants treated with Se showed higher net photosynthesis, water use efficiency and antioxidant system. This study provides useful information about the roles of Se in protecting rice plants from water deficit stress.

AB Mercury is severely detrimental to organisms and is ubiquitous in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, we examined the effects of chronic mercury (Hg) exposure on metamorphosis, body size, thyroid microstructures, liver microstructural and ultrastructural features, and transcript levels of genes associated with lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and thyroid hormones signaling pathways of Chinese toad (Bufo gargarizans) tadpoles. Tadpoles were exposed to mercury concentrations at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 mu g/L from Gosner stage 26-42 of metamorphic climax. The present results showed that high dose mercury (24 and 30 mu g/L) decelerated metamorphosis rate and inhibited body size of B. gargarizans larvae. Histological examinations have clearly exhibited that high mercury concentrations caused thyroid gland and liver damages. Moreover, degeneration and disintegration of hepatocytes, mitochondrial vacuolation, and endoplasmic reticulum breakdown were visible in the ultrastructure of liver after high dose mercury treatment. Furthermore, the larvae exposed to high dose mercury demonstrated a significant decrease in type II iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2) and thyroid hormone receptor a and beta (TR alpha and TR beta) mRNA levels. Transcript level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and heat shock protein (HSP) were significantly up regulated in larvae exposed to high dose mercury, while transcript level of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) was significantly down regulated. Moreover, exposure to high dose mercury significantly down regulated mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), sterol carrier protein (SCP), acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAP alpha), but significantly up regulated mRNA expression of fatty acid elongase (FAE), fatty acid synthetase (FAS) and Acetyl CoA Carboxylase (ACC). Therefore, we conclude that high dose mercury induced thyroid function disruption, liver oxidative stress and lipid metabolism disorder by damaging thyroid and liver cell structures and altering the expression levels of relevant genes.

AB b-Diketone antibiotics (DKAs) are widely used in human and veterinary medicine to prevent and treat a large variety of infectious diseases. Long-term DKA exposure to zebrafish can result in lipid metabolism disorders and liver function abnormalities. Based on our previous miRNA-seq analyses, miR-144 and miR-125b were identified as target genes regulating lipid metabolism. DKA-exposure at 12.5 and 25 mg/L significantly increased the expressions of miR-144 and miR-125b. The expression levels for the two miRNAs exhibited an inverse relationship with their lipid-metabolism-related target genes (ppardb, bcl2a, pparaa and pparda). Over-expression and inhibition of miR-144 and miR-125b were observed by micro-injection of agomir-144, agomir-125b, antagomir-144 and antagomir-125b. The over-expression of miR-144 and miR-125b enhanced lipid accumulation and further induced lipid-metabolism-disorder syndrome in F1-zebrafish. The expression of ppardb and bcl2a in whole mount in situ hybridization was in general agreement with results from qRT-PCR and was concentration-dependent. Oil red O and H&E staining, as well as related physiological and biochemical indexes, showed that chronic DKA exposure resulted in lipid-metabolism-disorder in F0-adults, and in F1-larvae fat accumulation, increased lipid content, abnormal liver function and obesity. The abnormal levels of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TCH) in DKA-exposed zebrafish increased the risk of hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. These observations improve our understanding of mechanisms leading to liver disease from exposure to environmental pollution, thereby having relevant practical significance in health prevention, early intervention, and gene therapy for drug-induced diseases.

AB The recent decline of Apis mellifera populations around the world has been subject of intense research due to ecological and economic damages resulting from the loss of pollination services. The intensive use of insecticides from the neonicotinoids group is among the possible causal factors of this decline, including also sub-lethal effects. However, the use of synthetic insecticides has been increased on a global scale in the recent decades. In order to evaluate an alternative to the use of neonicotinoids, this work investigated the effects of a bioinsecticide and its major compound on A. mellifera (Apidae: Hymenoptera), one of the main pollinators of crop plants. For this, bees were exposed, by contact and ingestion, to the essential oil of Cymbopogon martinii (Poaceae: Poales), to geraniol (major compound) and the insecticide imidacloprid to evaluate the toxicity and behavioral effects as well as the locomotion changes and immune responses of bees treated with these compounds. In general, toxicity was greater through ingestion and the insecticide imidacloprid was more toxic to A. mellifera compared to the essential oil and its major compound. The individual and collective behaviors (L e. trophallaxis, grooming, avoidance) as well as the immune responses of bees were not significantly affected by bioinsecticides. However, the locomotion response and flight orientation of the bees were significantly altered by insecticide when administered by ingestion. Our results highlight the potential of C. martinii essential oil and its major compound as a possible alternative to mitigate the harmful effects of neonicotinoids on bees.

AB Most studies on plants' response to heavy metal toxicity have been focusing on single metals. However, soils are always contaminated by several kinds of heavy metals. In this study, pot experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of combined toxicity on two rice genotypes differing in Cd accumulation (Xiushui817, a low- grain-Cd-accumulation and Zheda821, a high-grain-Cd-accumulation genotype). Yield, heavy metal concentrations of grain and leaf/stem at different growth stages were measured under combined application of Cd, Cr, Pb and Cu. Yield was significantly decreased under higher Pb and Cd treatment in both genotypes with Xiushui817 showing greater reduction. Increasing soil Cu level showed no significant effect on grain yield. Zheda821 consistently showed a higher grain Cd content than Xiushui817. The application of Pb, Cd, Cr and Cu significantly affected grain Cd, Cr and Cu accumulations. Similar trends were also observed in leaves and stems at harvest stage. The critical levels of leaf/stem Cd and Cr for safe rice production were also estimated. Alleviation measures should be taken to decrease Cd or Cr accumulations in grain of rice if leaf or stem Cd or Cr concentrations at different growth stages exceed the critical levels.

AB Carbon dots (CDs) as a new fluorescent material with excellent water solubility, chemical inertness, and easy surface modification are a good candidate for bioimaging and biosensing due to their low toxicity and good biocompatibility. Although carbon is not an intrinsically toxic substance, carbon nanomaterials such as CDs may cause risks to human health and the potentially hazardous effects of CDs on various living systems must be completely determined. So far, cytotoxicity studies of CDs have focused on human cells and are mainly conducted on limited cell lines. In the present study, toxicity assessment of CDs was evaluated on yeast cells Pichia pastoris as a unicellular eukaryotic model. Results revealed dose-dependent toxicity of CDs on yeast cells and less relative cell growth in 25 mg/ml of CDs as compared to the control group. CDs binding curve confirmed the interaction between CDs and surface of yeast cells. SEM images showed that the CDs caused cell shrinkage and hole formation on the surface of yeast cells and also induced slightly cell deformation. It was demonstrated that CDs could generate the ROS dose-dependently. Finally, results showed the growth inhibition and ROS generation effects of CDs were enhanced at light exposure, as an important environmental factor. These findings could have important implications for applications of CDs.

AB Omethoate, an organophosphorous pesticide, can cause a variety of health effects, especially the decrease of cholinesterase activity. The aim of this study is to explore the association of genetic polymorphisms of telomere binding proteins with cholinesterase activity in omethoate-exposed population. Cholinesterase activities in whole blood, red blood cell and plasma were detected using acetylthiocholine and dithio-bis-(nitrobenzoic acid) method; Genetic Genotyping of POT1 rs1034794, POT1 rs10250202, TERF1 rs3863242 and TERT rs2736098 were performed with PCR-RFLP. The cholinesterase activities of whole blood, red blood cells and plasma in exposure group are significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicates that exposure group (b = - 1.016, P < 0.001), agender (b = 0.365, P < 0.001), drinking (b = 0.271, P = 0.004) and TERF1rs3863242 (b = - 0.368, P = 0.016) had an impact on cholinesterase activities. The results suggest that individual carrying AG + GG genotypes in TERF1 gene rs3863242 polymorphism were susceptible to damage in cholinesterase induced by omethoate.

AB Cyanobacterial blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa represent a significant risk to the environment and have become a worldwide concern. M. aeruginosa can produce the hepatotoxins microcystins (MCs) with potential for tumor promotion. The present study evaluated the time-dependent effects in the transcription of tumor-related genes in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, exposed to dilutions of a M. aeruginosa lysate containing 3.5 and 54.6 mu g L-1 MCs. We used a cultured M. aeruginosa strain, RST 9501, which contains mainly the variant (D-Leu(1)] MC-LR and originated from the Patos Lagoon Estuary (RS, Brazil). The exposure caused short-term repression of tumor suppressor genes and long-term repression of proto-oncogenes. These responses were more evident for p53 that was repressed with exposure for 6, 24 and 96 h, and fosab and myca that were consistently repressed with exposure for 384 h, when fish were exposed to both M. aeruginosa lysate dilutions, compared to controls (p < 0.05). The suppressor genes, baxa and gadd45 alpha, and the proto-oncogene, junba, were suppressed mainly at 96 h, where both dilutions of the lysate caused repression compared to controls (p < 0.05). The p53 gene was the only gene to be induced; this occurred in fish exposed to lysate containing 3.5 mu g L-1 for 384 h. This is the first study to show that M. aeruginosa containing an environmentally relevant concentration of [D-Leu(1)] MC-LR could cause time-dependent repression of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in fish. The results suggest that short-term repression of tumor suppressor genes could participate in the mechanism of tumor promotion caused by M. aeruginosa in fish.

AB Wax gourd is a popular vegetable and the new organic copper pesticide product of copper nonylphenolsulfonate and hexaconazole was firstly recommended to control the serious disease powdery mildew frequently occurred in wax gourd. However, it is still a concern for data deficiency of residue amounts of these two pesticides in edible portion of wax gourd and the persistence in environment. In this study, the dissipation and residue of copper nonylphenolsulfonate and hexaconazole in wax gourd and soil were investigated. The experiment results demonstrated that the dissipation half-lives of copper nonylphenolsulfonate and hexaconazole in wax gourd and soil were 4.6-5.8 days and 7.1-21.7 days, respectively. After 3 days from the last treatment, the residues of copper nonylphenolsulfonate were below 0.38 mg kg(-1) in wax gourd and were below 0.21 mg kg(-1) in soil, and the residues of hexaconazole ranged from < 0.01 to 0.19 mg kg in wax gourd and from 0.01 to 0.63 mg kg(-1) in soil. The long-term dietary risk assessment was done based on the supervised trial median residue and Chinese dietary pattern combining corresponding standards, by comparing with national estimated daily intake, the results showed that it was safe to use copper nonylphenolsulfonat-exaconazole 20% microemulsion (ME) at the dosage of 420 g a.i. ha(-1) with the pre-harvest interval of 3 days in China. And it also supplied authorities with important data for establishing MRL standards of copper nonylphenolsulfonate and hexaconazole in wax gourd in China.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely distributed in polluted environments and are included in the priority list of toxic compounds. Previous studies have shown that the fungus Penicillium oxalicum, isolated from a hydrocarbon-polluted pond, has a great capability to transform different PAHs in short periods under submerged fermentation conditions. Although cytochrome p450s (CYPs) seems to be the main responsible enzyme in this process, changes in proteome profile remains poorly understood. The aim of this work was to characterise molecular disturbances in the cytosolic and microsomal sub-proteomes of P. oxalicum by applying two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and label-free quantitative proteomics during anthracene biodegradation. Our results showed that by using 2D-gels, 10 and 8 differential proteins were over-expressed in the cytosolic and microsomal fractions, respectively. Most of them were related to stress response. Shotgun proteomics allowed the identification of 158 and 174 unique protein species that differentially accumulated during anthracene biotransformation, such as CYPs, epoxide hydrolases and transferases enzymes, belonging to Phase I and Phase II of the metabolism of xenobiotics, contributing to the anthracene biodegradation pathway. These results confirm the biological significance of ascomycetes fungi the rol of CYPs on biodegradation and the need of a deeper knowledge on fungal proteomics for the application of the appropriate microorganisms in biodegradation processes.

AB Among all available species, fish are a powerful model for risk-benefit assessments to study the effects of contaminants on human health. Gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata, Linnaeus 1758) and european seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax, Linnaeus 1758) are two species of great economic importance, representing very large production volumes in the Mediterranean. The objective of this study is (1) to analyze the concentrations of Trace Elements (TE) between wild and cultured seabream and seabass specimens, (2) to compare the determined concentrations with other studies, and (3) to increase the data about the potential risks to human health. Our results point to significant intra- and interspecies-specific differences between wild and cultured fish for several trace elements. Several strong and moderate inter-elemental correlations in fish muscle were observed through correlation analysis. In our study, the mean levels of trace elements were still below the standard safety values for fish intended for human consumption. The same results were reached for all the parameters analyzed (international legal limits, estimated weekly intake, provisional tolerable weekly intake, target hazard quotient, target cancer risk), with trace element levels in fish below those that could pose a risk to human health. Consequently, these fish can be considered safe for human consumption. A better understanding of the levels of trace elements in fish would also better inform consumers about the potential risks of exposure to contaminants.

AB The anti-malarial drug artemisinin is extracted from the leaves of Artemisia annua L. Due to toxicity to some microorganisms, the release of artemisinin from this medicinal plant in commercial cultivation might produce a potential risk for phosphorus (P) solubilizing bacteria (PSB). Therefore, the growth, P mobilization, and proton and organic acid efflux by two PSB isolates, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens, obtained from the soil without growing A. annua L. in history in the region for growing A. annua L., Chongqing, China, were studied through soil and solution incubations with different nominal concentrations of artemisinin (0, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/kg or mg/L). Addition of artemisinin into soil and culture solutions decreased significantly the number of PSB except P. fluorescens at a low artemisinin concentration (2.5 mg/L) in culture solution which remained unchanged in comparison with the control (without artemisinin). This suggests high artemisinin inhibited the cell division or led to the death of PSB, and the different species responded differently to artemisinin. Compared with original soil, PSB inoculation significantly increased Olsen P, whilst the addition of artemisinin decreased this P form in soil. There was a positive correlation between the number of PSB and Olsen P content in soils (r(2) = 0.824, n = 8), indicating the involvement of PSB in P mobilization of insoluble minerals. Oxalate and acetate were commonly found in the bacterial culture solutions, which accounted for 73.6-84.4% of all organic acids in the culture medium without artemisinin. Malate was detected in the culture solution of B. subtilis, and citrate and succinate in P. fluorescens. The percentage of tricalcium phosphate solubilization (PTPS) positively correlated to the concentrations of protons and all organic acids (r(proton)(2) = 0.901, n = 8, P < 0.01; r(organic acids)(2) = 0.923, n = 8, P < 0.01). The concentrations of protons, organic acids and soluble inorganic P in culture solutions, and PTPS were decreased simultaneously as nominal artemisinin concentrations increased. For these decreases it implies the metabolic inhibition and the death of PSB caused by artemisinin could be the main reasons for the less efflux of protons and organic acids, presumably resulting in the decreased ability of PSB to mobilize inorganic P. Therefore, artemisinin released from A. annua L. in commercial and continual cultivation could adversely affect the community structure and inorganic P mobilization of PSB in soils.

AB Al contamination becomes a growing problem in human society. Accumulation of Al in blood could destroy the structure and disorder function of erythrocyte, and finally cause blood diseases. In the present study, AlCl3 and Al(malt)(3) are respectively used in the erythrocyte system, in order to investigate the comparative toxic effect on erythrocyte fragility, the influence on cellular biochemical components and lipid peroxidation level. We find that the osmotic fragility, the number of Heinz bodies, the content of MDA and advanced oxidation protein product of the AlCl3 treated erythrocytes were higher than the Al(malt)(3) treated erythrocytes at the same concentrations of Al(III). The morphological and membrane protein changes of the AlCl3 treated group show superior to the Al (malt)(3) treated group. In summary, we conclude that the comparative effect on the erythrocyte between organic aluminum and inorganic aluminum is significantly different, and the prime comparative difference between the toxic effects of both the compounds is oxidative stress. Further research should focus on in vivo experiments to confirm the differential toxicity and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying Al-induced erythrocyte toxicity in order to prevent hematological disorders.

AB objective: To find an efficient chromium (VI) resistance system, with a highly efficient, economical, safe, and environmentally friendly chromium-removing strain, ChrA, ChrB, and ChrAB fragments of the chromium (VI) resistance gene in Serratia sp. S2 were cloned, and their prokaryotic expression vectors were constructed and transformed into E. coli BL21. The anti-chromium (VI) capacity and characteristics of engineered bacteria, role of ChrA and ChrB genes in the anti-chromium (VI) processes, and the mechanism of chromium metabolism, were explored.
   Methods: The PCR technique was used to amplify ChrA, ChrB, and ChrAB genes from the Serratia sp. S2 genome. ChrA, ChrB, and ChrAB genes were connected to the prokaryotic expression vector pET-28a and transferred into E. coli BL21 for prokaryotic expression. Cr-absorption and Cr-efflux ability of the engineered strains were determined. The effects of respiratory inhibitors and oxygenated anions on Cr-efflux of ChrA and ChrB engineered strains were explored.
   Results: ChrA, ChrB, and ChrAB engineered strains were constructed successfully; there was no significant difference between the control strain and the ChrB engineered strain for Cr-metabolism (P > 0.05). Cr-absorption and Cr-efflux of ChrA and ChrAB engineered strains were significantly stronger than the control strain (P < 0.05). Oxyanions (sulfate and molybdate) and inhibitors (valinomycin and CN-) could significantly inhibit the Cr-efflux capacities of ChrA and ChrAB engineered strains (P < 0.05), while NADPH could significantly promote such capacities (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: The Cr-transporter, encoded by ChrA gene, confer the ability to pump out intracellular Cr on ChrA and ChrAB engineered strains. The ChrB gene plays a positive regulatory role in ChrA gene regulation. The Crmetabolism ability of the ChrAB engineered strain is stronger than the ChrA engineered strain. ChrA and ChrAB genes in the Cr-resistance

AB Boron toxicity is a worldwide problem, usually accompanied by salt (NaCl) and drought. The combined stresses may induce complex toxicity to the plant. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the combined stresses of salt and drought affect B toxicity in plants. Puccinellia tenuiflora seedlings were planted in vermiculite. A three (B) x three (salt) x three (drought) factorial experiment (for a total of 27 treatments) was conducted. After a 30-day cultivation, plants were harvested to determine dry weight and the concentrations of B, Na+ K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. Plant growth was inhibited by B toxicity, which was alleviated by salt and drought. B stress enhanced B uptake and transport of the plant, which was inhibited by salt and drought. B stress had a little effect on K+ and Na+ concentration and caused Ca2+ and Mg2+ accumulation in the plant. Salt addition increased Na+ concentration and inhibited Ca2+ and Mg2+ accumulation. Drought addition inhibited Na+ accumulation and enhanced Ca2+ and Mg2+ accumulation. The combined stresses of salt and drought had a greater alleviation on the inhibition of dry weight caused by B than individual salt and drought. Besides, the combined stresses of salt and drought also enhanced B uptake and inhibited B transport. The results indicate that salt, drought, and the combined stresses of salt and drought all can alleviate B toxicity in P. tenuiflora, the main mechanism of which is the restriction of B and Na+ uptake caused by salt and drought. The combined stresses of salt and drought have a greater effect on B toxicity than individual salt and drought

AB Intensive shrimp farming is generally accompanied by nutrient enrichment and gradual eutrophication, which impose major threats to shrimp culture ecosystems. However, little is known about how the bacterioplankton community in a rearing environment responds to increased eutrophication during shrimp culture processes. In this study, we used the MiSeq sequencing technique to explore the impacts of nutrient enrichment on the assembly and stability of the bacterioplankton community. Our results showed that magnitudes of the changes in the bacterioplankton community compositions (BCCs) and diversity were closely associated with eutrophication level. Moreover, a phylogenetic-based mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD) analysis revealed that increased eutrophication significantly (P < 0.01) changed the bacterioplankton ecological processes from deterministic to stochastic. A structural equation model showed that eutrophication indicators affected the BCCs either directly by controlling resources or indirectly by modifying other environmental variables of the shrimp ponds in complex pathways. Furthermore, association network comparisons revealed that nutrient enrichment increased the complexity of interspecies interactions and the proportion of cooperative interactions and decreased the proportion of generalists, which suggest that nutrient enrichment destroyed the community stability. These findings suggest that minimizing nutrient pollution, especially at the end of cultivation, could be an important management tool for establishing a microbially mature water system.

AB Hexavalent chromium (Cr-VI) is widely used in tanning industries, however, being highly toxic metal, its accumulation in the animal body can adversely affect reproductive functioning. If directly discharged untreated into the environment (adjoining nullahs and soil), it can contaminate the environment. Resultantly, along with human, inhabiting wildlife species get exposed to chromium toxicity, which may enter into the animal body through drinking water and food chain. The current study investigated toxic effects of Cr (VI) on testicular functioning of adult male small Indian mongooses inhabiting the tannery area of Kasur district, Pakistan. Soil, water and animal specimens were sampled from study area on monthly basis from February 2015 to January 2016. The captured mongooses were sacrificed to collect blood and body tissues (liver, kidneys and testes) samples. The concentrations of chromium in the samples were quantified using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Hormonal concentrations were estimated using ELISA kits. The cellular changes occurring in the testicular tissues were studied through light microscopy. Average Cr-concentrations were found significantly higher in experimental area soil and water samples, and in the blood and body tissues of the mongooses compared to control, while body and testicular weights of experimental animals were found reduced. Serum testosterone (p = 0.037) and luteinizing hormone (p = 0.000) levels were found significantly lowered while follicle stimulating hormone (p = 0.000) levels significantly increased in experimental animals. Histological analysis revealed disorganization of seminiferous tubules, and apparently decreased numbers of Sertoli and the Leydig cells. Spermatozoa and seminiferous tubular counts were also found significantly (p = 0.000) reduced compared to control. Interstitial spaces were found widened. The study concludes that Cr from tanneries environment is up taken by mongooses leading to testicular tissue damage and potential impairment of reproductive functioning of the species.

AB 20% commercial suspension emulsion (SE) of (8% tetraconazole + 12% kresoxim-methyl), as a pre-registered product in China, was firstly investigated under Chinese greenhouse-field conditions. A MWCNTs-based QuEChERS method for simultaneous determination of tetraconazole and kresoxim-methyl in strawberry was developed and validated via RRLC-QqQ-MS/MS. On basis of this method, the dissipation behaviours, residue distributions and dietary risk probability of these fungicides in strawberry were further investigated for food safety. The dissipations of tetraconazole and kresoxim-methyl followed first-order kinetics with the half-lives of 8.0-18.2 days. The highest residues (HRs) of these fungicides in the supervised trials at the pre-harvest interval (PHI, 3 days) were below 0.8970 mg kg(-1). The total national estimated daily intake (NEDI) of tetraconazole and kresoxim-methy in strawberry at the PHI 3 day was 0.2784 mg and 0.4031 mg, respectively, based on Chinese dietary pattern and terminal residue distributions under good agricultural practices (GAP) conditions. The risk quotients (RQs) of tetraconazole and kresoxim-methy at PHI 3 days were below 82.7% and 1.6%, respectively, showing that the evaluated strawberry exhibited an acceptably low dietary risk to consumers. The current study could not only guide reasonable usage of the formulation, but also facilitate the setting of maximum residue limits (MRLs) of tetraconazole in strawberry.

AB Copper oxide nanoparticles and copper sulfate are established contaminants of water and soil. Metaphire posthuma is a common variety of earthworm distributed in moist soil of Indian subcontinent. Comparative toxicity of copper nanoparticles and copper sulfate were investigated with reference to selected immune associated parameters of earthworm. Total count, phagocytic response, generation of cytotoxic molecules (superoxide anion, nitric oxide), activities of enzymes like phenoloxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and total protein of coelomocytes were estimated under the exposures of 100, 500, 1000 mg of copper oxide nanoparticles and copper sulfate per kg of soil for 7 and 14 d. A significant decrease in the total coelomocyte count were recorded with maximum depletion as 15.45 +/- 2.2 and 12.5 +/- 2 x 10(4) cells/ml under the treatment of 1000 mg/kg of copper nanoparticles and copper sulfate for 14 d respectively. A significant decrease in generation of nitric oxide and activity of phenoloxidase were recorded upon exposure of both toxins for 7 and 14 d indicating possible decline in cytotoxic status of the organism. A maximum inhibition of superoxide dismutase activity was recorded as 0.083 +/- 0.0039 and 0.055 +/- 0.0057 unit/mg protein/minute against 1000 mg/kg of copper nanoparticles and copper sulfate treatment for 14 d respectively. Activities of catalase and alkaline phosphatase were inhibited by all experimental concentrations of both toxins in the coelomocytes of earthworm. These toxins were recorded to be modifiers of the major immune associated parameters of M. posthuma. Unrestricted contamination of soil by sulfate and oxide nanoparticles of copper may lead to an undesirable shift in the innate immunological status of earthworm leading to a condition of immune compromisation and shrinkage in population density of this species in its natural habitat. This article is the first time report of immunological toxicity of nanoparticles and sulfate salt of copper in M.posthuma inhabiting the soil of India, an agriculture based country.

AB Endocrine disrupting effect has become a central point of concern, and various biological mechanisms involve in the disruption of endocrine system. Recently, we have explored the mechanism of disrupting hormonal transport protein, through the binding affinity of sex hormone-binding globulin in different fish species. This study, serving as a companion article, focused on the mechanism of activating/inhibiting hormone receptor, by investigating the binding interaction of chemicals with the estrogen receptor (ER) of different fish species. We collected the relative binding affinity (RBA) of chemicals with 17 beta-estradiol binding to the ER of eight fish species. With this parameter as the endpoints, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were established using DRAGON descriptors. Statistical results indicated that the developed models had satisfactory goodness of fit, robustness and predictive ability. The Euclidean distance and Williams plot verified that these models had wide application domains, which covered a large number of structurally diverse chemicals. Based on the screened descriptors, we proposed an appropriate mechanism interpretation for the binding potency. Additionally, even though the same chemical had different affinities for ER from different fish species, the affinity of ER exhibited a high correlation for fish species within the same Order (i.e., Salmoniformes, Cypriniformes, Perciformes), which consistent with that in our previous study. Hence, when performing the endocrine disrupting effect assessment, the species diversity should be taken into account, but maybe the fish species in the same Order can be grouped together.

AB Rapid adaptation of insect species to environmental changes can be advantageous for their development. Forest cockchafer (Melolontha hippocastani) is herbivorous insect species with high food intake that has been widely studied within European conditions. It can cause huge economic and ecological losses especially in oak-dominated forest stands. Food preference of this species is mainly comprised of trees with a potential to accumulate manganese in their assimilation apparatus. In order to determine cockchafer's reactions to increased Mn concentration in its food, the adults were reared in laboratory conditions controlled for temperature, humidity, and light on a natural diet of oak (Quercus petraea) leaves. Food was contaminated by soaking in solutions of MnCl2 .4H(2)O in concentrations from 0.5 to 10 mg ml(-1). Food consumption, activity period of adults, quantity of eggs laid, body weights of individuals, as well as Mn concentrations in unconsumed food, excrement, and the bodies of cockchafers were determined to indicate how these change in reaction to food quality altered in terms of Mn content.
   The results showed that very high Mn content in the diet significantly influenced food consumption by M. hippocastani adults and thereby their development. This was in spite of the tendency of individuals to expel Mn through the faeces and incorporate it into undetermined parts of their bodies. Negative reactions of the experimental population were determined in treatments fed leaves with Mn concentration of 1800 ppm and more. Our experiment proved that Mn can greatly influence the phytophagous cockchafer (decreased feeding time, food consumption, and fertility).

AB Contamination of economic bivalves with paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) occurs frequently in many parts of the world, which potentially threatens consumer health and the marine aquaculture economy. It is the objective of this study to develop a suitable technology for accelerating detoxification of PST from shellfish using activated carbon (AC). The adsorption efficiency of PST by eight different AC materials and by different particle sizes of wood-based AC (WAC) were tested and compared. Then WAC particles (37-48 mu m) were fed to mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis and scallops Chlamys farreri previously contaminated with PST through feeding with dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense ATHK. Results showed that the maximum adsorption ratio (65%) of PST was obtained by WAC. No significant differences in adsorption ratios were found between different particle sizes of WAC. The toxicity of mussels decreased by 41% and 68% after detoxification with WAC for 1 d and 3 d, respectively. Meanwhile, the detoxification ratio of mussels was approximately 3 times higher than that of scallops. This study suggests that the WAC could be used to accelerate the detoxification of PST by shellfish.

AB The waste water treatment plant (WWTP) of the city of Bizerte concentrates different types of chemical and biological pollutants in the Bizerte lagoon (Tunisia). Considering four upstream and downstream WWTP discharge stations, seventy nine, culturable bacterial strains were isolated and identified from water and sediment as fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, pathogenic staphylococci and non-enterobacteriacea. Fecal coliforms were most abundant (2.5 10(5) bacteria/mg) in sediment of WWTP discharge. Leuconostoc spp (23.1%) and Chryseomonasluteola (23.1%) were the most prevalent culturable fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) isolated at the upstream discharge stations. However, Staphylococcus xylosus (13.9%) was the most prevalent culturable FIB isolated at the WWTP discharge stations. Moreover, high antibioticresistance phenotypes were present in all sampling stations, but especially in WWTP discharge station in both water and sediment. Resistance levels in water and sediment, respectively were amoxicillin (58.8%; 34.8%), penicillin (50%; 31.6%), oxacillin (60%; 33.3%), cefotaxim (55.2%; 39.1%), ceftazidim (66.7%; 50%), gentamycin (42.9%; 38.9%), tobramycin (50%; 25%), vancomycin (33.3; 71.4%), amikacin (66.7%; 0%) and ciprofloxacin (100%; 100%). Interestingly, beta-lactam antibiotic resistant FIB were mostly isolated from water as well as from sediments of upstream and WWTP discharge station. Canonical correspondence analysis CCA correlating antibiotic resistance profile with the abiotic data showed that, in water column, culturable bacterial strains isolated in upstream WWTP discharge stations were interestingly correlated with the resistance to amikacin, oxacillin, cefotaxim, ciprofloxacin and gentamycin, however, in sediment, they were correlated with the resistance to amoxicillin, oxacillin, cefotaxim and vancomycin. Serious beta-lactams and aminoglycosides acquired resistance appeared mainly in fecal strepto-cocci and pathogen staphylococci groups.

AB The interactions between plants and nanomaterials (NMs) can shed light on the environmental consequences of nanotechnology. We used the major crop plant rice (Oryza sativa L.) to investigate the uptake of gold nano-particles (GNPs) coated with either negatively or positively charged ligands, over a 5-day period, in the absence or presence of one of two amino acids, aspartic acid (Asp) or lysine (Lys), acting as components of rice root exudates. The presence of Asp or Lys influenced the uptake and distribution of GNPs in rice, which depended on the electrical interaction between the coated GNPs and each amino acid. When the electrical charge of the amino acid was the same as that of the surface ligand coated onto the GNPs, the GNPs could disperse well in nutrient solution, resulting in increased uptake of GNPs into rice tissue. The opposite was true where the charge on the surface ligand was different from that on the amino acid, resulting in agglomeration and reduced Au uptake into rice tissue. The behavior of GNPs in the hydroponic nutrient solution was monitored in terms of agglomeration, particle size distribution, and surface charge in the presence and absence of Asp or Lys, which depended strongly on the electrostatic interaction. Results from this study indicated that the species of root exudates must be taken into account in assessing the bioavailability of nanomaterials to plants.

AB This study investigated the levels of metal and metalloid elements (As, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in scalp hair samples collected from 161 people of different age and gender groups living in the six districts of Taiyuan, an industrial city with rich coal reserve in Shanxi province in China. Levels of most elements in the hair were high in the 26-40 age groups and increased with the length of residence. Calcium, Cr, Mg, Ni and Zn levels in the females' hair were significantly higher than those in the males' (p < 0.05). Element levels in the hair didn't have significantly differences between industrial and non-industrial districts because most of industry factories are in the upper wind position in Taiyuan, and contamination is prone to spread to non-industrial districts. The principal component analysis indicates that the main sources of these elements are mining activities, the neighboring stainless steel industry, and coal combustion. These results indicate that the industrial activities primarily contribute to the metal and metalloid pollution in Taiyuan, whereas numerous factors caused the metals accumulation in hair.

AB In this study a new calix[4]arene triazole 5 was successfully synthesized using click reaction and characterized through UV-visible, FT-IR, H-1 NMR spectroscopes and Mass Spectrometry. The supramolecular interaction of compound 5 towards commonly used drugs has been carried out using UV-Visible spectroscopy. The supra molecule 5 showed characteristic enhancement in the absorbance intensity after mixing with Cefuroxime at pH (2-12). Compound 5 displayed considerably good interactions with cefuroxime in the presence of other drugs. Compound 5 exhibits linear relationship with cefuroxime concentration in the range of (10-80 mu M) with regression value of 0.9954. The standard deviation for 50 mu M Cefuroxime was found to be 0.01 and the limit of detection for cefuroxime was calculated to be 2 mu M. Job's plot experiments showed 1:1 (5: cefuroxime) binding stoichiometry between compound 5 and cefuroxime. Supramolecule 5 displayed fairly good spectrophotometric recognition of Cefuroxime in human blood plasma and tap water thus showing that the ingredients of tap water and plasma sample was inert in the recognition of cefuroxime.

AB Pharmaceuticals are micropollutants often present in wastewater treatment systems. In this study, the potential impact of such micropollutants on the bacterial population within aerobic granular sludge (AGS) bioreactor was investigated. The AGS bacterial community structure and composition were accessed combining DGGE fingerprinting and barcoded pyrosequencing analysis. Both revealed the existence of a dynamic bacterial community, independently of the pharmaceuticals presence. The AGS microbiome at both phylum and class levels varied over time and, after stopping pharmaceuticals feeding, the bacterial community did not return to its initial composition. Nevertheless, most of the assigned OTUs were present throughout the different operational phases. This core microbiome, represented by over 72% of the total sequences in each phase, probably played an important role in biological removal processes, avoiding their failure during the disturbance period. Quantitative-PCR revealed that pharmaceuticals load led to gradual changes on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAO) but their persistence during that phase demonstrated the resilience of such bacterial groups. AGS microbiome changed over time but a core community was maintained, probably ensuring the accomplishment of the main biological removal processes.

AB Acute lethal and sublethal toxicity of the pirimicarb-based commercial formulation Aficida (R) were evaluated on Boana pulchella tadpoles. Whereas mortality was used as end point for lethality, frequency of micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities as well as alterations in the frequency of erythroblasts in circulating blood as biomarkers for genotoxicity and cytotoxicity, respectively. Swimming, growth, developmental and morphological abnormalities were also employed as sublethal end points. Results show that the species is within the 13th percentile of the distribution of acute sensitivity of species to pirimicarb for aquatic vertebrates. Results revealed values of 23.78 and 101.45 mg/L pirimicarb as LC50(96) h for GS25 and GS36 tadpoles, respectively. The most evident effects were related with the swimming activity with NOEC and LOEC values within the 0.005-0.39 mg/L pirimicarb concentration range. Aficida (R) induced DNA damage at the chromosomal level by increasing micronuclei frequency and other nuclear abnormalities, ie., lobbed and notched nuclei and binucleated cells. Cellular cytotoxicity was found after Aficida (R) treatment. The presence of abdominal oedemas in exposed organisms and thus flotation response of organisms could be proposed as a new sensitive exposure parameter. The multiple end point assessment approach used allowed a complete understanding the multi level of effects occurring by exposure to pirimicarb, at least in B. pulchella.

AB Little is known about the effect of ionic liquids (ILs) on the structure of soil microbial communities and resulting biodiversity. Therefore, we studied the influence of six trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium ILs (with either bromide or various organic anions) at sublethal concentrations on the structure of microbial community present in an urban park soil in 100-day microcosm experiments. The biodiversity decreased in all samples (Shannon's index decreased from 1.75 down to 0.74 and OTU's number decreased from 1399 down to 965) with the largest decrease observed in the microcosms spiked with Its where biodegradation extent was higher than 80%. (i.e. [P-66614] [Br] and [P-66614][2,4,4]). Despite this general decrease in biodiversity, which can be explained by ecotoxic effect of the Its, the microbial community in the microcosms was enriched with Gram-negative hydrocarbon-degrading genera e.g. Sphingomonas. It is hypothesized that, in addition to toxicity, the observed decrease in biodiversity and change in the microbial community structure may be explained by the primary biodegradation of the ILs or their metabolites by the mentioned genera, which outcompeted other microorganisms unable to degrade ILs or their metabolites. Thus, the introduction of phosphonium-based ILs into soils at sub-lethal concentrations may result not only in a decrease in biodiversity due to toxic effects, but also in enrichment with ILs-degrading bacteria.

AB Ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation and the growth hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) have been known to cause various changes in plants at morphological and physiological levels as individual entities, but their interactive effects on the overall plant performance remain practically unknown. The present study was conducted under near-natural field conditions to evaluate the effects of supplemental (s)-UV-B (ambient+3.6 kJ m(-2) day(-1)) treatment alone, and in combination with two doses of IAA (200 ppm and 400 ppm) exogenously applied as foliar spray on various growth-, morphological-, physiological-, and biochemical parameters of an indigenous medicinal plant, Coleus forskohlii. Under s-UV-B, the plant growth and morphology were adversely affected (along with reductions in protein- and chlorophyll contents) with concomitant increase in secondary metabolites (as substantiated by an increase in the activities of various enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway) and cumulative antioxidative potential (CAP), suggesting the plant's capability of adaptive resilience against UV-B. The essential oil content of the plant was, however, compromised reducing its pharmaceutical value. IAA application at both doses led to a reversal in the effects caused by s-UV-B radiation alone; both the plant growth as well as the essential oil content improved, especially at the higher IAA dose, suggesting its ameliorative role against UV-B induced oxidative stress, and also in improving the plant's medicinal value.

AB Soil phosphatase, which plays an important role in phosphorus cycling, is strongly inhibited by Arsenic (As). However, the inhibition mechanism in kinetics is not adequately investigated. In this study, we investigated the kinetic characteristics of soil acid phosphatase (ACP) in 14 soils with varied properties, and also explored how kinetic properties of soil ACP changed with different spiked As concentrations. The results showed that the Michaelis constant (K-m) and maximum reaction velocity (V-max) values of soil ACP ranged from 1.18 to 3.77 mM and 0.025-0.133 mM h(-1) in uncontaminated soils. The kinetic parameters of soil ACP in different soils changed differently with As contamination. The K-m remained unchanged and V-max decreased with increase of As concentration in most acid and neutral soils, indicating a noncompetitive inhibition mechanism. However, in alkaline soils, the K-m increased linearly and V-max decreased with increase of As concentration, indicating a mixed inhibition mechanism that include competitive and noncompetitive. The competitive inhibition constant (K-ic) and noncompetitive inhibition constant (K-iu) varied among soils and ranged from 0.38 to 3.65 mM and 0.84-7.43 mM respectively. The inhibitory effect of As on soil ACP was mostly affected by soil organic matter and cation exchange capacity. Those factors influenced the combination of As with enzyme, which resulted in a difference of As toxicity to soil ACP. Catalytic efficiency (V-max/K-m) of soil ACP was a sensitive kinetic parameter to assess the ecological risks of soil As contamination.

AB The wide application of plastic products led to the wide exposure of plasticizer in environment. As a new environmental pollutant, plasticizers' toxicity researches were far from enough in fish. In order to further explore these mechanisms, we used Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), a common plasticizer, treated the grass carp hepatocytes, and selected Eucalyptol (EUC) to study its antagonistic effect on DEHP. The results showed that after DEHP exposure, oxidative stress level and inflammation in grass carp hepatocytes were increased, and then mRNA and protein expression of apoptosis related markers were increased significantly, leading to hepatocytes apoptosis. Moreover, AO/EB staining and Hoethst staining also showed that the number of apoptotic cells increased after DEHP exposure. It should be noted that both EUC pretreatment and EUC simultaneous treatment could alleviate the oxidative stress, levels of inflammatory factors and apoptosis induced by DEHP. In comparison, the effect of EUC simultaneous treatment was better. Our results showed that DEHP induced apoptosis in grass carp hepatocytes through oxidative stress and inflammation, while EUC could alleviate apoptosis by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation caused by DEHP. The innovation of this study was to explore the interaction between DEHP and EUC for the first time. This study found that DEHP could cause apoptosis in grass carp hepatocytes through oxidative stress and inflammation; EUC had a good antagonistic effect on a series of damage in grass carp hepatocytes caused by DEHP, and EUC pretreatment and simultaneous treatment had a certain effect, among which, simultaneous treatment had a better effect. This study enriched the theoretical mechanism of DEHP toxicity in fish hepatocytes, and put forward the methods to solve the toxicity of DEHP.

AB Fungicide thiram, a representative dithiocarbamate pesticide can cause potential health hazards to humans and animal health due to the residues in various agricultural products. However, the effects of thiram on lipid metabolism by perturbing gut microbiota of chickens are not clear. Our study was aimed to explore the protective of polysaccharide extracted from Morinda officinalis (MOP) on acute thiram-exposed chickens, and to analyze the association between alteration of gut micmbiota and lipid metabolism. Three hundred chicks are fed with a normal diet, thiram-treated diet (100 mg/kg), and a thiram-treated diet supplemented with 250, 500, or 1000 mg/kg MOP was used in this study, respectively. The results showed that thiram exposure prominently elevated liver index, changed liver function by histopathological examination and serum biochemistry diagnoses, and increased blood lipid parameters. Meanwhile, the expression level of some key genes in hepatic lipid metabolism dysregulated significantly in the thiram-exposed chickens. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that thiram exposure can significantly alter the richness, diversity, and composition of the broiler fecal microbiota, and the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria was also affected at the phylum level. In addition, some microbial populations including Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, Oscillospira, Blautia, and Butyricicoccus significantly decreased at the genus level, whereas the Klebsiella was opposite. Correlation analysis further revealed a significant association between microorganisms and lipid metabolism-related parameters. Optimistically, 500 mg/kg MOP can alleviate the damage of thiram in the gut and liver. Together, these data suggest that thiram exposure causes the imbalance of the gut microbiota and hepatic lipid metabolism disorder in chickens.

AB The effects of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) on sex ratio, gonopodium morphology, and gonadal histology of C. decemmaculatus were assessed by a full-lifecycle exposure experiment. Newborn fish were waterborne exposed to 30, 100, and 300 ng EE2/L for 90 d, using 50 fish per treatment. Additionally, in December of 2016, a field survey was conducted on a C. decemmaculatus population inhabiting the Girado Creek downstream of the Chascomus city wastewater effluent discharge. After 90 d of exposure, EE2 was able to histologically skew the sex ratio toward females and inhibit the full gonopodium development since the lowest tested concentration (LOEC = 30 ng/L). At higher concentrations, EE2 was toxic, inducing mortality in a concentration-dependent fashion (90 d-LC50 = 109.9 ng/L) and altering the gonadal histoarchitecture, causing neither testes nor ovaries discernible histologically (LOEC = 100 ng/L). In addition, a novel response, perianal hyperpigmentation, was discovered been induced by the EE2 exposure in a concentration-dependent fashion (90 d-EC50 = 39.3 ng/L). A higher proportion of females and perianal hyperpigmentation were observed in wild fish collected from the Girado Creek. The major reached conclusions are: i) EE2 induce different effects on the sexual traits of C. decemmaculatus when exposed from early-life or adult stages. ii) The most sensitive effects observed in the laboratory occur in a creek receiving wastewater effluent. iii) The perianal hyperpigmentation comes-up as a promising biomarker of exposure to estrogenic compounds.

AB Ionic liquids have been becoming new 'green solvent' because of the low saturation vapor pressure, less volatilization and more recycling utilization. Since most ILs are soluble in water, it should be indispensable to evaluate the ecotoxicology effect of ILs on aquatic environment before using them widely. Based on the concept of norm index, a set of norm descriptors were proposed for anions, cations and ILs. The whole IL structure optimization method has been used to build a predictive norm index-based quantitative structure-toxicity relationship model for the toxicity of ILs on Vibrio fischeri. Statistical results indicated that norm descriptors were reliable and robust in expressing the relationship between structural information and toxicity of ILs. Meanwhile, a series of ILs without experimental values were predicted based on this stable QSTR model. The results indicated that for imidazole-based ILs, an increase in the length of substituent in the branch could enhance the toxicity of ILs on Vibrio fischeri, and the branch contains hydroxyl group, double bond or triple bonds might reduce the toxicity of ILs. Results obtained in this present work would be valuable for the molecular design and the toxicity evaluation toward aquatic organism of ILs.

AB Cyantraniliprole was recently registered for controlling the coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei, the main coffee pest in the world. In this study, baseline determination and resistance monitoring to cyantraniliprole were carried out in Brazilian populations of H. hampei. Evaluations were carried out for three years with representative field-collected populations from nine coffee-producing states in Brazil, using artificial diet containing the insecticide. The likelihood of control failure due to cyantraniliprole resistance was also determined. Populations from Campo do Meio, Linhares and Jau were more susceptible (<2-fold resistance) to cyantraniliprole than populations from Patrocinio and Londrina (17-fold). Nonetheless, the frequency of cyantraniliprole resistance insects was low and not significant throughout the regions survey and the likelihood of control failure was negligible. Therefore, cyantraniliprole remains an important management tool against the coffee berry borer without current problems of control failure. However, enough field variation in susceptibility to cyantraniliprole exists justifying attention and careful management of this insecticide to prevent quick development of insecticide resistance in populations of this insect pest species.

AB Arsenic (As) and copper (Cu) are common environmental pollutants in nature. When they are excessively present in living organisms, they can cause heavy metal poisoning. There were relatively few studies of the toxicological concentrations of As and Cu in the brain using chicken as a model. Therefore, in this study, arsenic trioxide or/ and copper sulfate were added to chicken diets for a 12-week toxicity test. The test results showed that excessive intake of As or/and Cu led to a significant reduction in the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), catalase (CAT) and hydroxyl radicals. And significant increase in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) indicates an imbalanced oxidation reaction. In addition, the increase in heat shock protein (HSPs), the increase of NF-kappa B pathway-related pro -inflammatory mediators, the change of apoptosis factors on the death receptor and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway show that, As or/and Cu exposure induced chicken brain has heat shock response (HSP), tissue inflammation and apoptosis. This damage is inseparable from the oxidative imbalance. It is worth noting that these injury changes are time-dependent, and the combined effect of these two metals is more severe than that of a single group of injuries. Our findings can inform the regulation of animal feed additives and avoid agricultural economic losses or biological health damage.

AB The impact of bioaerosols in municipal solid waste management is nowadays identified as a growing health concern worldwide. In this study, exposure to endotoxin in composting facilities and its association with lung function and clinical symptoms was investigated in Tehran municipal solid waste management complex (Aradkooh) as one of the largest solid waste management facilities in the Middle East. Airborne endotoxins were collected between June and July 2019 and the concentrations were determined by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) method. Healthy workers with no history of respiratory disease were recruited and data on clinical symptoms (cough, phlegm, wheezing, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, eye irritation, runny nose, runny eyes, and sore throat) was obtained by the modified American Thoracic Society questionnaire, and spirometric measurement was performed by an expert. The binary logistic regression test was used and adjusted for confounding variables. The results didn't show any difference in lung function parameters (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, PEF, FEF25-75%), and most of the respiratory symptoms despite a relatively high difference in the concentration of endotoxin observed in air samples of different locations. Only the increased risk of cough (OR 10.5, 95% CI: 2.4 to 44.8 in the moderately exposed group and 7.8, 95% CI: 1.6 to 39.1 in highly exposed ones), fatigue (OR 3.7, 95% CI: 1.2 to 11.7), and headache (OR 6.02, 95% CI: 1.4 to 24.5) were found in the exposed groups compared to controls after adjusting for age, active and passive smoking. However, findings of the study might be underestimated due to some issues including healthy worker effect, intra and intersubject variability, and selfreporting bias, thereby the results should be interpreted with caution. Although we did not find any relationship, due to the high concentrations of endotoxins observed in some sites, it is recommended to consider some possible prevention measures such as using personal protective equipment to reduce the exposure of workers at an acceptable level.

AB The effects of cadmium (Cd) have been investigated in an aquatic plant Ottelia alismoides grown under low CO2. Under low CO2, no Cd treated O. alismoides operated three carbon dioxide-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) efficiently, including HCO3- acquisition, C4 and CAM photosynthesis. After 4 days of treatment with 200 mu M and 2000 mu M Cd, O. alismoides exhibited an elevated Cd accumulation along with the increasing Cd concentration. Both Cd treatments induced appreciable phytotoxicities in O. alismoides. The leaves showed chlorosis symptoms and the anatomy as well as chloroplast ultrastructure were obviously damaged. Significant decreases in the content of pigments, chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm and Yield of PS II) and carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13) were measured in leaf extracts of O. alismoides grown with both concentrations of Cd. In addition, the pH-drift technique showed that both Cd-treated O. alismoides plants could not uptake HCO3-. The maximum and minimum acidity in Cd-exposed O. alismoides were greatly decreased and the diurnal change of acidity was absent in both Cd treated plants. Furthermore, significant decreases in ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) activities were also found at Cd treated O. alismoides plants, indicating the disturbance within C4 cycle. The alterations in the functionality of CCMs in O. alismoides induced by Cd might be related with the inhibition of the enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase (CA) and PEPC involved in inorganic carbon fixation, and the destruction of chloroplasts, as well as the re-allocation of energy and nutrients involved in CCMs and Cd detoxification.

AB Adverse health effects arising from exposure to fine particulates have become a major concern. Angiogenesis is a vital physiological process for the growth and development of cells and structures in the human body, whereby excessive or insufficient vessel growth could contribute to pathogenesis of diseases. We therefore evaluated indirect effects of carbon black (CB) and inhalable airborne particles on the angiogenic ability of unexposed Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) by co-culturing HUVECs with pre-exposed Small Airway Epithelial Cells (SAECs). As endothelial cells are major components of blood vessels and potential targets of fine particles, we investigated if lung epithelial cells exposed to ambient PM2.5 surrogates could induce bystander effects on neighboring unexposed endothelial cells in an alveolar-capillary co-culture lung model. Epithelial exposure to CB at a non-toxic dose of 25 mu g/mL reduced endothelial tube formation and cell adhesion in co cultured HUVECs, and decreased expression of angiogenic genes in SAECs. Similarly, exposure of differentiated SAECs to PM2.5 surrogates reduced cell reproductive ability, adhesion and tube formation of neighboring HUVECs. This indicates epithelial exposure to CB and urban PM2.5 surrogates both compromised the angiogenic ability of endothelial cells through bystander effects, thereby potentially perturbing the ventilation-perfusion ratio and affecting lung function.

AB Cotton-based adsorbents (CBAs) are promising materials for combating the problem of heavy metal pollution of environmental waters. This is ascribed to the low cost, abundance, biodegradability and efficiency of CBAs. Herein we review the adsorption of heavy metals (HMs) onto CBAs. We found that several surface modifications were employed to improve the efficiency of the CBAs. These modifications were effected via thermal, physical and chemical means to obtain activated carbons, biochars, ionic liquids, aerogels, hydrogels, chitosans and nanoparticle-derived CBAs. The CBAs exhibited maximum HMs uptake as low as 0.002 mg/g to as high as 505.6 mg/g. Although, the cotton-derived activated carbons and biochars exhibited enhanced HM uptake from that of the unmodified CBAs, they were less efficient than CBAs modified by other methods. Recent chemical, ionic liquid, chitosan and nano-derived CBAs were the most efficient, with high uptake and fast kinetic removal. However, the nanoparticle-based adsorbents are preferred to the chemically modified forms, due to the possibility of secondary pollution and the noxious effect of the later to the environment. Findings showed that chemical treatment produced CBAs most efficient for As(V), Pb(II) and Fe(III), while ionic liquid CBA was more efficient for Cu(II) and Ni(II). Nano-based treatment was suitable for the uptake of Co(II), Zn(II), Pb(II) and Cd (II), while the chitosan based adsorbent was viable for Hg(II). Isotherm and kinetic evaluation of CBAs mostly conformed to the Langmuir and pseudo-second order models, respectively. Spontaneous adsorption of HMs onto CBAs was deduced from thermodynamic analysis, with endothermic and exothermic characteristics. Over 88% desorption of HMs was obtained from the CBAs studied with good average reusability from 3 to 20 cycles. We also discussed the directions for future research.

AB Mercury (Hg) is an environmental contaminant that poses great risk to human health. However, it is still widely used in artisanal gold-mining enterprises around the world, especially in developing countries. Methylmercury (MeHg) is produced environmentally by biomethylation of inorganic Hg present in water sediments, leading to its subsequent accumulation in the aquatic food chain. Due to its high metabolic rate, the Central Nervous System (CNS) is one of the main targets of MeHg. In the present study, we investigate the impact of chronic MeHg intoxication on NADPH diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity and astrocyte mobilization in the visual cortex of the rat. After 60 days of MeHg administration by oral gavage (0.04 mg/kg/day), tissue samples containing the visual cortex were submitted to measurements of Hg levels, NADPH-d activity, and GFAP immunohistochemistry for identification of astrocytes. MeHg intoxication was associated with increased Hg deposits and with reduced NADPH-d neuropil reactivity in the visual cortex. A morphometric analysis suggested that NADPH-d-positive neurons were mostly spared from MeHg harmful action and intoxicated animals had astrocytic activation similar to the control group. The decrease in NADPH-d neuropil reactivity may be due to the negative effect of chronic MeHg poisoning on both the synthesis and transport of this enzyme in afferent pathways to the visual cortex. The relative resistance of NADPH-d-reactive neurons to chronic MeHg intoxication may be associated with peculiarities in cell metabolism or to a protective role of nitric oxide, safeguarding those neurons from Hg deleterious effects.

AB Nowadays, nanotechnology and its related industries are becoming a rapidly explosive industry that offers many benefits to human life. However, along with the increased production and use of nanoparticles (NPs), their presence in the environment creates a high risk of increasing toxic effects on aquatic organisms. Therefore, a large number of studies focusing on the toxicity of these NPs to the aquatic organisms are carried out which used algal species as a common biological model. In this review, the influences of the physio-chemical properties of NPs and the response mechanisms of the algae on the toxicity of the NPs were discussed focusing on the "assay" studies. Besides, the specific algal toxicities of each type of NPs along with the NP-induced changes in algal cells of these NPs are also assessed. Almost all commonly-used NPs exhibit algal toxicity. Although the algae have similarities in the symptoms under NP exposure, the sensitivity and variability of each algae species to the inherent properties of each NPs are quite different. They depend strongly on the concentration, size, characteristics of NPs, and biochemical nature of algae. Through the assessment, the review identifies several gaps that need to be further studied to make an explicit understanding. The findings in the majority of studies are mostly in laboratory conditions and there are still uncertainties and contradictory/inconsistent results about the behavioral effects of NPs under field conditions. Besides, there remains unsureness about NP-uptake pathways of microalgae. Finally, the toxicity mechanisms of NPs need to be thoughtfully understood which is essential in risk assessment.

AB Caenorhabditis elegans is sensitive to toxicity of environmental pollutants. The alteration in expression of mir-794, a microRNA (miRNA) molecule, mediated a protective response to nanopolystyene (100 nm) at predicted environmental concentration (1 mu g/L) in nematodes. However, the underlying molecular basis for mir-794 function in regulating the response to nanopolystyrene remains largely unclear. In this study, we found that intestinal overexpression of mir-794 caused the susceptibility to nanopolystyrene toxicity, suggesting that mir-794 acted in the intestine to regulate the response to nanopolystyrene. Intestinal overexpression of mir-794 further decreased the expressions of daf-16 encoding a FOXO transcriptional factor in insulin signaling pathway, skn-1 encoding a Nrf transcriptional factor in p38 MAPK signaling pathway, and mdt-15 encoding a lipid metabolic sensor acting downstream of SKN-1 in nanopolystyrene exposed nematodes. Meanwhile, intestinal overexpression of mir-794 could suppress the resistance of nematodes overexpressing intestinal daf-16, skn-1, or mdt-15 containing the corresponding 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) to nanopolystyrene toxicity. Therefore, DAF-16, SKN-1, and MDT-15 acted as the downstream targets of intestinal mir-794 to regulate the response to nanopolystyrene. In the intestine, DAF-16 functioned synergistically with SKN-1 or MDT-15 to regulate the response to nanopolystyrene. Our results suggested that the intestinal mir-794 provided an important epigenetic regulation mechanism to control the response to nanopolystyrene by linking insulin and p38 MAPK signaling pathways in nematodes.

AB Selenium (Se) is a beneficial element to higher plants. Application of Se at low concentrations enhances the antioxidant metabolism reducing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by plant membrane cells. This study aimed to evaluate how the application of Se in the forms sodium selenate and sodium selenite regulates ROS scavenging in field-grown cowpea plants. Seven Se application rates (0; 2.5; 5; 10; 20; 40 and 60 g ha(-1)) of each of the two Se forms were applied to plants via the soil. Photosynthetic pigments concentration, gas exchange parameters, lipid peroxidation by malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, hydrogen peroxide concentration, activity of catalase (CAT, EC:1.11.1.6), glutathione reductase (GR, EC:1.6.4.2), ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC:1.11.1.11) and Se concentration in leaves and grains were evaluated. In general, Se application led to a decrease in chlorophyll a concentration whilst leading to an increase in chlorophyll b, indicating conservation of total chlorophyll concentration. Application of 2.5 g ha(-1) of Se as selenate provided a notable increase in total chlorophyll and total carotenoids compared to the other application rates. Selenate and selenite application decreased lipid peroxidation. However, each Se source acted in a different pathway to combat ROS. While selenate showed more potential to increase activity of APX and GR, selenite showed a higher potential to increase CAT activity. The negative correlation between CAT and GR is indicative that both pathways might be activated under distinct circumstances. The more prominent activity of CAT under high rates of selenite resulted in a negative correlation of this enzyme with chlorophyll a and carotenoids. Both selenate and selenite application increased sucrose and total sugars concentration in leaves of cowpea plants. Overall, these results indicate that application of Se in cowpea under field conditions stimulates distinct pathways to scavenge ROS. This could prove beneficial to mitigate oxidative stress during plant development.

AB This study compared co-tolerance to salinity and cadmium and investigated its mechanisms in a facultative metallophyte Silene vulgaris originating from distinct habitats. Shoots of calamine (Cal) and non-metallicolous (N-Cal) ecotypes grown in vitro were exposed to 10 and 100 mM NaCl, 5 mu M CdCl2 and their combinations. Stress effects were evaluated based on growth, oxidative stress parameters, and DNA content and damage. Tolerance mechanisms were assessed by analyzing non-enzymatic antioxidants, osmolytes and ion accumulation.
   Irrespective of the ecotype, Cd stimulated shoot proliferation (micropropagation coefficients MC = 15.2 and 12.1 for Cal and N-Cal, respectively, growth tolerance index GTI = 148.1 and 156.7%). In Cal ecotype this was attributed to an increase in glutathione content and reorganization of cell membrane structures under Cd exposure, whereas in N-Cal to enhanced synthesis of other non-enzymatic antioxidants, mainly carotenoids and ascorbate. Low salinity stimulated growth of Cal ecotype due to optimizing Cl- content. High salinity inhibited growth, especially in Cal ecotype, where it enhanced DNA damage and disturbed ionic homeostasis. Species-specific reaction to combined salinity and Cd involved a mutual inhibition of Na+, Cl- and Cd2+ uptake. N-Cal ecotype responded to combined stresses by enhancing its antioxidant defense, presumably induced by Cd, whereas the metallicolous ecotype triggered osmotic adjustment. The study revealed that in S. vulgaris Cd application ameliorated metabolic responses to simultaneous salinity exposure. It also shed a light on distinct strategies of coping with combined abiotic stresses in two ecotypes of the species showing high plasticity in environmental conditions.

AB Monitoring of oxidative stress caused by a wide range of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is essential to have an idea about the fitness and growth of photosynthetic organisms. The imaging-based oxidative stress measurement in cyanobacteria using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) dye has the limitation of small sample size as the only selected number of cells are analyzed to measure the ROS levels. Here, we developed a method for oxidative stress measurement by DCFH-DA and flow cytometer (FCM) using unicellular Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and filamentous Fremyella diplosiphon BK14 cyanobacteria. F. diplosiphon BK14 inherently possess high levels of ROS and showed higher sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide treatment in comparison to S. elongatus PCC 7942. We successfully measured oxidative stress in glutaredoxin lacking strain (Delta grx3) of S. elongatus PCC 7942, and wild-type Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 using FCM based method. Importantly, ROS were not detected in these two strains of cyanobacteria by fluorescence microscope-based method due to their small spherical morphology. Delta grx3 strain showed high ROS levels in comparison to its wildtype strain. Treatment of abiotic factors such as high PAR in wild-type and Delta grx3 strains of S. elongatus PCC 7942, low PAR or low PAR + UVR in wild-type S. elongatus PCC 7942, and high PAR or high PAR + NaCl in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 increased oxidative stress. In summary, the FCM based method can measure ROS levels produced due to physiological conditions associated with genetic changes or abiotic stress in a large population of cells regardless of their morphology. Therefore, the present study shows the usefulness of the method in monitoring the health of organisms in a large scale cultivation system.

AB Ciliates are key components of aquatic ecosystems, significantly contributing to the decomposition of organic matter and energy transfer to higher trophic levels. They are considered good biological indicators of chemical pollution and relatively sensitive to heavy metal contamination. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of the available toxicity data of heavy metals and ciliates to assess: (1) the sensitivity of freshwater ciliates to different heavy metals, (2) the relative sensitivity of ciliates in comparison to the standard test species used in ecotoxicological risk assessment, and (3) the difference in sensitivity across ciliate taxa. Our study shows that the tolerance of ciliates to heavy metals varies notably, which is partly influenced by differences in methodological conditions across studies. Ciliates are, in general, sensitive to Mercury > Cadmium > Copper > Zinc > Lead > Chromium. Also, this study shows that most ciliates are more tolerant to heavy metal pollution than the standard test species used in ecotoxicological risk assessments, i.e., Raphidocelis subcapitata, Daphnia magna, and Onchornyncus mykiss. Threshold concentrations derived from toxicity data for these species is expected to confer sufficient protection for the vast majority of ciliate species. Our data analysis also shows that the most commonly tested ciliate species, Paramecium caudatum and Tetrahymena thermophila, are not necessarily the most sensitive ones to heavy metal pollution. Finally, this study stresses the importance of developing standard toxicity test protocols for ciliates, which could lead to a better comprehension of the toxicological impact of heavy metals and other contaminants to ciliate species.
